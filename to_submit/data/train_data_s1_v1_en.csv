2,1,1,30,INFP,2,"<neutrality>  I don't explore a wide range of interests, but I mostly like things related to nature and history, and I'm a bit interested in birds these days. Even if there is interest, interest did not last long, so I made it neutral."
3,1,1,30,INFP,3,"<Yes>  Because he empathizes well, he cries even when people are crying in a comedy movie, so he doesn't go to the movie theater often. I don't want to cry in my head, but there are many times when I'm embarrassed because I'm already crying."
4,1,1,30,INFP,4,"<neutrality>  make preparations, but I tend to end up building them. This is because work variables can arise, and if there are no countermeasures in place when variables arise, it is difficult to cope with them because your mind becomes blank. However, thinking about too many variables is annoying, so I stop making preparations in the middle."
5,1,1,30,INFP,5,"<no>  I am unable to maintain my composure. My mind is blank and I can't speak properly. When I was interviewing, even though it was a video interview, I felt more pressure on myself, so I couldn't speak much more than when I practiced."

10,1,1,30,INFP,10,"<neutrality> Sometimes I look at the shelf in my family store, but there are times when I make a calculation mistake. It may be at times like that, but even though I repeat it, the mistake doesn't leave my head."

12,1,1,30,INFP,12,"<no>  I love seeing discussions about different interpretations, but I hate it because it's annoying and I'm not good at talking."

20,1,1,30,INFP,20,"<no>  I think about it once in a while, but I don't worry too much. Because if you worry too much, things won't go your way."

39,1,1,30,INFP,39,"<no>  I plan a lot, but I don't like doing it every day. I need a rough plan at work, but I make it simply in my head, not in detail, and I don't make it every day in my personal work."
40,1,1,30,INFP,40,"<no> There are many times when I feel insecure. I wonder if I can live like this, and I have anxiety about old age and health. Being bullied for a long time seems to have been the trigger for my confidence in myself to decrease."

44,1,1,30,INFP,44,"<Yes> If there is a setback, I try to make only that part different and go back to the original plan. When I went on a recent trip, the restaurant I wanted to go to disappeared, so I ate somewhere else and acted as originally planned."
45,1,1,30,INFP,45,"<Yes>  It's a mistake that was made a long time ago, and I often regret it even though I can't change it anymore. There was a time when I only slept for two weeks after the college entrance exam, but at that time, I lost a lot of muscles and my body was very weak, so I still haven't recovered."

61,2,1,40,ESTJ,1,<neutrality> I'm not trying to make it on purpose. I like things that come naturally as I live.
62,2,1,40,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  I have a lot of really diverse interests. These days, I learned to ride a bike for my health, so I got to know and bought a variety of bikes."
63,2,1,40,ESTJ,3,"<Yes>  Tears flow when I see other people crying. The reason is that they seem to empathize well, so I think they are equally sad."
64,2,1,40,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  always have a workaround ready in case something goes wrong. Otherwise, I feel anxious and it is a habit since I was young."
65,2,1,40,ESTJ,5,"<no>  I try to keep my composure, but it doesn't work. Not long ago, while working on a computer, an error occurred and I was pressed for time, but I was in a hurry."

70,2,1,40,ESTJ,10,"<neutrality>  Even two or three years ago, when I made a mistake, I doubted my abilities. Now I think that anyone can make a mistake, probably because I am trying to relax a little bit."
71,2,1,40,ESTJ,11,"<neutrality>  At first, it can be difficult depending on the seat. You might think I'm a weirdo. It can be difficult at first, but once you start talking, it's okay."
72,2,1,40,ESTJ,12,"<no>  I like to talk. In particular, since each individual interprets a work of art so differently, I want to hear other people's interpretations as well."
73,2,1,40,ESTJ,13,"<Yes>  I am very rational. When I follow my emotions, there are times when I have regrets, so I try to leave it to reason. I think people around me see me that way too."
74,2,1,40,ESTJ,14,"<no> I'm planning anything. Especially when you go on a trip, you have to plan rather than improvise to reduce time waste and feel regretful."

77,2,1,40,ESTJ,17,"<neutrality>  For me, when the ending is ambiguous, it feels unfinished. I have to present the ending to some extent so that I can interpret it even a little, but I don't want an ending that is too absurd."

79,2,1,40,ESTJ,19,"<Yes>  I have a lot of interests. I also recently started riding a bike and making crafts, but there are so many things I want to do that I have so many interests that if I don't make a plan, I'll mess up."

129,3,0,40,ISTP,9,"<neutrality>  I try to plan like that, but in reality I'm not very good at it. I am using a mobile diary and a real paper diary."
130,3,0,40,ISTP,10,"<Yes>  The older I get, the more I feel intimidated by the smallest mistakes. Things that used to be easy are now difficult. The same goes for helping children with their homework."

135,3,0,40,ISTP,15,"<neutrality>  I don't care much about other people's eyes when I'm in a relationship with someone I don't know, but in a close relationship, I'm somewhat concerned. There are a lot of things to bump into, but I don't think it's good if it's uncomfortable."
136,3,0,40,ISTP,16,"<no>  Group activities are not free, so I do not enjoy participating. Fees are rare, but I think of group activities when I am bored or lonely because I am alone."

139,3,0,40,ISTP,19,"<no>  It's not that I don't have a lot of interests, but I don't think I've ever been so cluttered that I didn't know what to do. Not even recently."

161,3,0,40,ISTP,41,"<neutrality>  There is not much to avoid everyday calls with friends or close people, but there seem to be many calls to avoid, such as calls to government offices, call centers, or spam calls due to civil complaints."
162,3,0,40,ISTP,42,"<no>  I don't think I'll spend a lot of time trying to understand if I don't have to. However, it will be the opposite if it is with someone who is important to me."
163,3,0,40,ISTP,43,"<no> I'm not the type to contact my friends to meet them first. If a friend contacts you first, do not refuse."
164,3,0,40,ISTP,44,"<neutrality>  If there is a setback in the plan, it seems that there are many cases in which the plan is modified depending on the degree of trying to return to the plan."
165,3,0,40,ISTP,45,"<Yes>  I don't know if there are many times when I regret the mistakes I made a long time ago, but there are cases where I regret it. Especially if you are currently suffering losses due to that mistake."
166,3,0,40,ISTP,46,"<Yes>  The reason for human existence and life is a difficult problem, and right now, solving the realistic problem in front of me is my top priority, so I tend not to think deeply about it."
167,3,0,40,ISTP,47,"<neutrality>  I don't think I'm the type to be swayed by emotions, and people around me seem to give me similar evaluations."
168,3,0,40,ISTP,48,"<neutrality>  It's different depending on the case, but if it doesn't hurt me, I think it's okay to build up the other person's side."
181,4,1,40,INFJ,1,<no>  I prefer old friends to new ones. My best friend still meets the friend I met in kindergarten when I was 5 years old.
182,4,1,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  Politics, TV content. I am interested in dating programs, etc. Other than that, I am very interested in our children."
183,4,1,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes>  When I see someone else crying, I don't know why, but tears just come out and I almost cry with them."
184,4,1,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes>  Even when I'm looking for directions, I take a screenshot in advance in case the navigation on my phone doesn't work."
185,4,1,40,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  The work I do is very labor-intensive, so people often curse at me while I work, but I tend to keep my composure well while listening to music and imagining pleasant things."
186,4,1,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  can talk to someone new without hesitation, but I don't want to be friendly with them."
187,4,1,40,INFJ,7,<Yes>  I prefer to finish one neatly and start a new one rather than trying to do several things at once.
188,4,1,40,INFJ,8,"<Yes>  I have a lot of tears and enjoy sentimental imaginations such as reading books, listening to music, and watching movies."
189,4,1,40,INFJ,9,<Yes>  also record what's in the refrigerator and plan my diet using a memo app on my phone. All schedules are also memoized on electronic tools.
190,4,1,40,INFJ,10,<Yes>  I have many sleepless days even for a small slip of the tongue. I always dwell on other people's mistakes just as much as my own.
191,4,1,40,INFJ,11,"<neutrality>  I seem to be pretending to be indifferent to those who are interested. However, it is easy to talk to people who are not interested."
192,4,1,40,INFJ,12,"<Yes>  I enjoy discussing works of art. When I watch a movie, I look at how others have seen it, and I also tend to leave reviews."
193,4,1,40,INFJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. I like logical things, and I don't want to easily act on things that cannot be logically explained."
194,4,1,40,INFJ,14,"<no> When I go on an impromptu trip, I always regret it, and I don't enjoy spontaneous meetings very much."
195,4,1,40,INFJ,15,"<neutrality>  I care about how others see me. However, I tend to worry more about the inner things than the outer ones."
196,4,1,40,INFJ,16,"<neutrality>  enjoy it, but I worry about it. For example, I like group tours. Since I value compliance and courtesy to others, I strictly abide by the rules and promises set by the organization. However, there is also a great fear of not keeping it."
197,4,1,40,INFJ,17,"<Yes>  I tend to enjoy my own interpretation of the ending. I enjoyed watching a movie called Romance, but I don't conclude that this movie is a sexual minority relationship, but interpret it broadly with many different ways of dating."
198,4,1,40,INFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I am more satisfied with my success than the success of others. It's because I want to be the main character rather than the role of a manager helping others. However, I think family problems are an exception."
199,4,1,40,INFJ,19,<no>  You tend to fall more deeply into one interest rather than multiple interests.
200,4,1,40,INFJ,20,"<Yes>  am often worried. I tend to worry a lot and keep thinking about things that are important to me, fearing that something important will go wrong or go wrong."
201,4,1,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid leadership roles. I'm a little worried about getting attention, and I don't enjoy being focused on a lot of responsibility and various perspectives."
202,4,1,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  Normally, I am sentimental, I like to think about things while appreciating works of art."
203,4,1,40,INFJ,23,"<Yes>  tend to think that if people acted calmly and rationally without putting their feelings first, war would not have happened."
204,4,1,40,INFJ,24,"<neutrality>  I always promise and want to finish my chores before I go to rest, but when I'm tired, I lie down."
205,4,1,40,INFJ,25,"<Yes>  I like to watch TV discussions, and I like to take sides while watching and murmuring to myself."
206,4,1,40,INFJ,26,<no> I'm not particularly careful about getting other people's attention. I am humorous enough that I prefer to have the people at the table next to me listen to me.
207,4,1,40,INFJ,27,"<Yes>  Emotions change very quickly. There are times when I get angry momentarily, but within 5 minutes I forget why I was angry."
208,4,1,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed with people who can't work. I can't stand my juniors who can't handle things better than me, and I tend to nag them."
209,4,1,40,INFJ,29,"<Yes>  There are times when I procrastinate. Recently, there was a time when I had to wash the dishes because I didn't have a spoon to use after putting it off until the end."
210,4,1,40,INFJ,30,"<neutrality>  I'm not very interested in the question of the afterlife, but I try to separate garbage every day and live rightly to go to heaven after death."
211,4,1,40,INFJ,31,<no> Spending time alone is much better. The time to meet other people or drink doesn't give me a break.
212,4,1,40,INFJ,32,"<neutrality>  It is true that real-life stories are more interesting than original stories, but I do not feel bored about the discussion itself."
213,4,1,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  don't think I'm good at empathy, but others tell me I'm good at empathy. I'm the type of person who is good at putting in the words of others and reacting appropriately, but I don't know if it's because I'm good at empathizing."
214,4,1,40,INFJ,34,"<Yes>  I have indecisiveness, so when I buy clothes, I go around the department store five times. Even choosing food takes a long time."
215,4,1,40,INFJ,35,"<no>  I tend to think again, so I sometimes change my mind about things I bought and cancel them again."
216,4,1,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  prefer to spend time alone, so a fun party or event is close to work for me."
217,4,1,40,INFJ,37,<Yes>  I love art museums so much that I go to them three or four times a year even though I am busy.
218,4,1,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  It's easy to understand other people's feelings. Even when I watch a broadcast, I easily fall into it even though I know that it is a situation created by the writer and PD."
219,4,1,40,INFJ,39,"<Yes>  plan my life. When I travel, I plan by the minute. Even when you are working, you need to make sure you have a clear schedule so that you feel comfortable."
220,4,1,40,INFJ,40,"<Yes>  I often feel insecure. When I meet people, I often bite my nails as if I feel timid and anxious in the middle of having fun. I think it's an innate tendency."
221,4,1,40,INFJ,41,<no>  I have no intention of avoiding phone calls. He is good at talking on the phone and is confident.
222,4,1,40,INFJ,42,"<neutrality>  If there is an opinion that is very different from mine, I would like to hear it because it is interesting, but I do not think it will change my stubbornness and thoughts."
223,4,1,40,INFJ,43,"<no>  Meetings with friends usually seem to lead the meeting. However, I tend to attend regular fellowship meetings without missing them."
224,4,1,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes>  I don't like to mess with my plans. So if there is a setback, I try to fix it quickly and get back to the plan. There's something I've decided to finish by today, but if a friend comes to visit, I'll spend time fixing the plan right after the friend leaves."
225,4,1,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes>  He has the personality of kicking evil without forgetting his mistakes from long ago. Until now, chicken skin has sprouted all over my body because of embarrassing thoughts that come to mind once in a while, and I tend to look for mouse holes. There was a time when I was seriously offended by a joke made by a friend, and I regret it very much."
226,4,1,40,INFJ,46,"<no>  tend to think a lot about human existence and the reason for living. I like to study people, and I tend to think deeply about people's lives."
227,4,1,40,INFJ,47,"<Yes>  I tend to put a lot of effort into controlling my emotions, but since my emotions are dynamic, I sometimes find myself being swayed."
228,4,1,40,INFJ,48,"<neutrality> When the other party's fault is obvious, if the other person admits their mistake 100%, we try to make the other person feel better and make the atmosphere better. However, when the other person is not aware of or does not admit their fault, they try to let them know, even by giving them a face."
241,5,1,40,ISTJ,1,"<no>  I don't make new friends on a regular basis. The reason is that the older you get, the greater your fear of meeting new people."
242,5,1,40,ISTJ,2,"<Yes> I've been interested in Kang Tae-oh, the male lead in 'The Strange Lawyer Woo Young-woo', which I enjoyed these days, so I often look for the actor's Instagram or materials."
243,5,1,40,ISTJ,3,"<no>  In general, in situations like this, rather than wanting to cry together, I think first of all, 'Why is that person crying?' I don't think I feel unconditionally sad."
244,5,1,40,ISTJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to make multiple preparations for one thing. For example, if you plan to go out and go to a restaurant today, there is a possibility that you will not be able to go to that restaurant, so you look for one or two more restaurants. It's because I think there are variables in everything, and I don't like to be confused when variables arise."
245,5,1,40,ISTJ,5,"<Yes>  think I tend to keep my composure. Not too long ago, I went on a trip alone with my children and my mother. Because it was a free trip, there was pressure to make plans alone and to return safely and safely. In addition to traveling safely, I thought a lot about being responsible for the joy of my family. However, as I traveled, there were so many things that went wrong with what I had planned. However, when I tried to solve the problem without panic or impatient, it seemed to be solved. So I was able to finish the trip safely."
246,5,1,40,ISTJ,6,<Yes>  tend to talk to people I already know. The reason is that it is difficult to reach new people.
247,5,1,40,ISTJ,7,"<Yes>  tend to finish one project and start another. Some time ago, I was going to buy a computer and some furniture, but I didn't order both at once. First, I researched computers, decided and ordered a computer to buy, and then I researched furniture and ordered furniture. The reason is because I think that focusing on one thing will bring better results than trying to find out both at the same time. I tried to focus on just one thing because I think you need to know the product well before buying it in order to be satisfied later."
248,5,1,40,ISTJ,8,"<no>  am not a sentimental person. It's because when you listen to a song, you don't pay attention to the lyrics at all and you don't feel sad when you listen to sad music."
249,5,1,40,ISTJ,9,"<no>  I like to make plans, but I don't use a diary or something to make a schedule or list."
250,5,1,40,ISTJ,10,"<no> There are times when the food that you eat delicious every day tastes different or tasteless one day. That said, rather than thinking that I can't cook, I think it was because I didn't cook properly that day."
251,5,1,40,ISTJ,11,"<no>  It seems that the more interested you are, the harder it is to start a conversation. For example, when I was young, if I had a friend of the opposite sex with whom I liked, I would have talked to the opposite sex friend next to me instead of talking to the opposite sex I liked."
252,5,1,40,ISTJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in such things. Because people have different thoughts and personalities, I think that when they see a work of art, they are all different. So it's pointless to discuss such ideas."
253,5,1,40,ISTJ,13,<Yes>  tend not to be swayed by emotions when making decisions. I heard a lot of people around me say that I am a rational person.
254,5,1,40,ISTJ,14,"<no>  Whenever possible, I try to plan a schedule for the day and stick to it. For example, when I have to go to the department store, I prefer to go out properly and schedule the next day or another day rather than going suddenly."
255,5,1,40,ISTJ,15,"<no>  I tend to worry very much about who I look like. I don't have a specific reason, but since I was young, I think I was very worried about what other people would think of me and how they would look at me if I behaved like this."
256,5,1,40,ISTJ,16,<no>  I don't like going to crowded gatherings. It seems to get worse and worse as I get older.
257,5,1,40,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I like movies with clear endings. That's why I prefer movies with endings, like disaster movies, rather than movies where you have to interpret the ending."
258,5,1,40,ISTJ,18,<no>  I am a person who considers my success more important than others. The reason is because I think I can help others only when I succeed.
259,5,1,40,ISTJ,19,"<no> I'm not the type of person who has a lot of interests, but I'm the type who only pays attention to things that interest me."
260,5,1,40,ISTJ,20,"<Yes>  I tend to view situations negatively, so I often worry. The reason is that if things go wrong while not worrying, the psychological damage is greater than if things go wrong while worrying."
261,5,1,40,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  don't want to lead an organization. The reason is that people's personalities are all different, so I think it's the hardest thing to get along with a lot of people."
262,5,1,40,ISTJ,22,"<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. These days, I do a lot of work, such as doing interiors myself or making picture frames, but I feel like I want to do more."
263,5,1,40,ISTJ,23,"<neutrality>  think that if everyone lives rationally, there will be no big problems, but if that happens, the world will be harsh and desolate. In terms of society, it could be a better world, but I think humans will become like machines."
264,5,1,40,ISTJ,24,"<Yes>  If I'm going to rest, it's because I want to finish all my work and rest with a comfortable mind without anxiety."
265,5,1,40,ISTJ,25,"<neutrality>  Controversy can be enjoyable if you are interested in it, but not enjoyable at all if you are not interested in it."
266,5,1,40,ISTJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't like to stand out on my own. Because I care about how others see me and what they think of me. I don't like to be noticed by others, so when it comes to clothing, I prefer plain styles that don't stand out. In that respect, it seems that he is trying not to attract attention from others."
267,5,1,40,ISTJ,27,<no> It seems that there are very few cases where you feel bad and then suddenly get better or vice versa.
268,5,1,40,ISTJ,28,"<neutrality> It's not annoying, it's frustrating, and I feel pathetic. In the past, an acquaintance invited me to a housewarming party, but no food was prepared. My acquaintance is not good at cooking, so even though I prepared food all night, I couldn't finish it all. So I have memories of helping an acquaintance to cook. I didn't understand the friend who couldn't finish cooking even though I prepared all night, but I didn't get angry and I think he helped me out of frustration."
269,5,1,40,ISTJ,29,"<Yes>  I guess I tend to procrastinate. Even recently, when I have something to do, I seem to procrastinate and do it last."
270,5,1,40,ISTJ,30,<no>  don't think it makes much sense to discuss the afterlife because it has not been scientifically proven.
271,5,1,40,ISTJ,31,"<no>  When I was in my 20s, I enjoyed hanging out with people, but now that I am in my 40s, I prefer being alone."
272,5,1,40,ISTJ,32,"<Yes>  I don't like to discuss whether it's theory or principle. Yesterday, acquaintances came to my house to talk about mathematical theory, but it was boring."
273,5,1,40,ISTJ,33,"<neutrality>  I think I can sympathize with you in my heart, but in reality it will be difficult to completely sympathize with the other person, so I chose neutral. For example, if a friend who grew up wealthy since childhood complains that he can't buy what he wants because he doesn't have money, he'll say sorry in front of him, but he doesn't seem to be able to sympathize with him in his heart. But on the contrary, if a friend who grew up in a very difficult family says it's hard, I think I'll sympathize."
274,5,1,40,ISTJ,34,"<Yes>  I guess I tend to procrastinate. It is often difficult to make decisions because you are indecisive. So when I have to make a decision, I tend to put it off until the end."
275,5,1,40,ISTJ,35,"<no>  Even after making a decision, I tend to rethink it over and over again. It's because my personality is indecisive and it's difficult to make decisions."
276,5,1,40,ISTJ,36,"<no>  I prefer spending time alone. These days, rather than going to a crowded place and hanging out with people, I prefer to relax at home watching a movie or drama I want."
277,5,1,40,ISTJ,37,<no>  I don't really like going to art galleries. Because I like making art more than looking at it.
278,5,1,40,ISTJ,38,"<Yes>  I listen to and understand the feelings of my acquaintances on the outside, but there are many times when I do not understand them on the inside. For example, there are many times when I don't understand what an acquaintance who complains that he has no money is thinking when he spends money better than I do."
279,5,1,40,ISTJ,39,<Yes>  I like to plan and do both work and personal things. It's because things seem to go better when you have a plan in place.
280,5,1,40,ISTJ,40,"<neutrality>  There are times when I am anxious, but on the contrary, there are times when I am anxious, but there are times when I am not anxious. I feel anxious about the future, but I don't seem to feel anxious about the present. There is no reason, it seems to be an innate tendency."
281,5,1,40,ISTJ,41,"<Yes>  prefer to text rather than call as I am uncomfortable talking on the phone. When I get on the phone, I don't know what to say and I'm tired of idle chatter."
282,5,1,40,ISTJ,42,"<no>  I don't bother trying to understand opinions that differ from mine. For example, if a friend made a choice opposite to mine, rather than trying to understand that friend, I just think that the friend has a different opinion from me."
283,5,1,40,ISTJ,43,<no> I'm waiting for a call from a friend. I don't think it's good to contact you to meet first.
284,5,1,40,ISTJ,44,"<no>  If something goes wrong with my plan, I tend to change it to suit the circumstances. When I went on a free trip a while ago, the tourist attraction I wanted to see was closed, so I couldn't see it that day, and there was a setback in my schedule as I had time to spare."
285,5,1,40,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  I didn't do that in the past, but these days I often regret it. As I had a problem with my work due to Corona, I thought a lot of 'I shouldn't have made that choice in the past...'."
286,5,1,40,ISTJ,46,<Yes>  I don't like to think about that. It's because I think that discussing the reason for human existence and life seems pointless and meaningless.
287,5,1,40,ISTJ,47,<no>  I am a person who is not easily swayed by emotions. People around me also evaluate me as a rational person.
288,5,1,40,ISTJ,48,"<Yes>  Even if you know it's the other person's fault, you don't try to blame it. Not to save face, but because I think others will point it out even if I don't point it out. Also, it's because I don't like to come out and say something I don't like."
301,6,1,30,INTP,1,<no>  I don't make new friends on a regular basis. Because making new friends takes a lot of energy.
302,6,1,30,INTP,2,"<Yes>  I spend a lot of time exploring my interests. Nowadays, there is a lot of interest in artificial intelligence."
303,6,1,30,INTP,3,"<no>  When we see someone else crying, we try to think of a way to solve the problem rather than wanting to cry with them."
304,6,1,30,INTP,4,<neutrality>  I like to find new solutions immediately when things go wrong rather than planning ahead.
305,6,1,30,INTP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. There was a thesis presentation recently, and I finished it calmly."
306,6,1,30,INTP,6,<Yes>  I prefer to talk to people I already know because I'm more comfortable talking to people I'm familiar with.
307,6,1,30,INTP,7,"<no>  Working on multiple projects at the same time is more fun, relaxing and more efficient."
308,6,1,30,INTP,8,"<no>  I am more analytical than sentimental. Even if you watch a drama or a movie, you analyze the emotions of the characters rather than immerse yourself in them."
309,6,1,30,INTP,9,"<neutrality>  Likes to make plans, but doesn't stick to them. When planning, I prefer to use digital tools rather than analog tools."
310,6,1,30,INTP,10,"<neutrality>  When studying or working, I usually pursue perfection, but I am tolerant of small mistakes."
311,6,1,30,INTP,11,"<neutrality>  It's usually difficult to approach someone new, but if you can share your interests, you can easily approach and talk."
312,6,1,30,INTP,12,"<Yes>  I like to analyze and interpret by myself, but I don't feel the need to discuss with others."
313,6,1,30,INTP,13,<Yes>  I always prefer reason over emotion. Family and friends often say the same.
314,6,1,30,INTP,14,"<neutrality>  I like to plan my day, but I don't follow through, and I often do things spontaneously."
315,6,1,30,INTP,15,"<Yes>  As long as I have confidence in myself, I don't care what other people think."
316,6,1,30,INTP,16,"<no>  like activities that I do alone or with a small group of people. It's hot these days, so I want to be alone even more."
317,6,1,30,INTP,17,<Yes>  It's fun to see a work where I can interpret the ending in my own way. I recently enjoyed watching Devil Judge.
318,6,1,30,INTP,18,"<neutrality>  It's good to help others succeed, but I think I enjoy working for my own success because I'm more interested in myself."
319,6,1,30,INTP,19,"<Yes>  have so many interests, but I'm afraid I won't be able to do them all. Recently, I studied math, English, and computer science at the same time."
320,6,1,30,INTP,20,"<Yes>  Since I spend a lot of time alone, I have a lot of thoughts, so I tend to have a lot of negative thoughts."
321,6,1,30,INTP,21,<Yes>  Leadership is daunting because you're bad at understanding the thoughts and feelings of many people.
322,6,1,30,INTP,22,<Yes>  It was difficult to create something new when doing creative activities at school or academy.
323,6,1,30,INTP,23,"<Yes>  I believe that if people valued rationality over emotions, they would have made a better world with fewer accidental harms and wider horizons."
324,6,1,30,INTP,24,"<no>  When I'm tired, I tend to take a break first and then do housework. Because you often feel tired."
325,6,1,30,INTP,25,"<neutrality>  It would be fun if it was a logical and meaningful conversation, but it wouldn't be fun if it felt useless."
326,6,1,30,INTP,26,"<neutrality>  I don't feel pressured to get people's attention, but I don't bother trying to get attention."
327,6,1,30,INTP,27,<no>  My emotions are usually fairly constant. He doesn't get angry and he doesn't get excited.
328,6,1,30,INTP,28,"<neutrality>  It's frustrating to see people who aren't as efficient as I am, but that's not my job, so it doesn't matter."
329,6,1,30,INTP,29,"<Yes>  almost always put things off until the end. I have to write my thesis right now, but I keep putting it off."
330,6,1,30,INTP,30,<neutrality>  The thought process of people who imagine and define the afterlife is more interesting than the afterlife itself.
331,6,1,30,INTP,31,<no>  I feel more energized when I am alone than when I am with others. These days I am almost always at home alone.
332,6,1,30,INTP,32,"<Yes>  took a sociology theory class, but I felt it was boring to separate the theory from the reality and talk about the theory only."
333,6,1,30,INTP,33,"<Yes>  I enjoy seeing the world from different perspectives, so it's fun to put yourself in the shoes of someone from a different background than mine."
334,6,1,30,INTP,34,"<neutrality>  It depends on what you want to decide. Some decisions are easy, while others take a long time to think about."
335,6,1,30,INTP,35,"<neutrality>  don't regret the decisions I've already made, but I do reflect on the process of making decisions. You'll be able to decide in a better way next time."
336,6,1,30,INTP,36,"<no>  I always like to spend time alone. If you're at a party, you should spend two days alone."
337,6,1,30,INTP,37,"<no>  I don't know how to appreciate art, so I don't go to places like art galleries."
338,6,1,30,INTP,38,"<Yes> It is often difficult to understand the feelings of others, especially those who care too much about others or are too timid."
339,6,1,30,INTP,39,"<neutrality>  Planning daily to-dos is fun, but not very punctual. So often we revise, and then we abandon the plan altogether."
340,6,1,30,INTP,40,"<neutrality>  I get a little stressed when I have important things to do, but I'm not too anxious."
341,6,1,30,INTP,41,<Yes>  rarely make phone calls. It's because it's hard to recognize emotions when you're talking without looking at your face.
342,6,1,30,INTP,42,<no>  I am usually not very interested in opinions that deviate significantly from my logical conclusions.
343,6,1,30,INTP,43,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I ask to meet first, and sometimes my friend asks to meet first. Both are comfortable."
344,6,1,30,INTP,44,"<no> If there is a setback in my plan, I tend to try to come up with a new plan rather than going back to the old plan. In particular, I plan hard before I go on a trip, but when I arrive at my destination, I do whatever I want."
345,6,1,30,INTP,45,"<Yes>  I don't think much of my past mistakes, but I keep thinking about the mistakes I made to someone about 5 years ago and I regret it."
346,6,1,30,INTP,46,"<neutrality>  I thought a lot about human nature until a few years ago, but I haven't been thinking too much about it lately. Because no more interesting thoughts come to mind."
347,6,1,30,INTP,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions well when I am with other people. Friends and family also appreciate it.
348,6,1,30,INTP,48,"<no>  If the other person's fault is obvious, it seems difficult just to try not to point it out. It seems difficult to save face."
361,7,1,30,ISFP,1,"<no>  I'm very shy and I don't like unfamiliar environments, so I don't want to meet new friends while paying attention to each other."
362,7,1,30,ISFP,2,"<neutrality>  I don't explore a variety of interests. I just look for it when I'm curious, and I'm interested in camping these days."
363,7,1,30,ISFP,3,"<no>  When I see other people crying, I don't really feel anything. I just wonder why that person is doing that."
364,7,1,30,ISFP,4,"<no>  I tend not to think of countermeasures. If I think about it, things will go wrong for some reason, so I tend to solve them at the right time."
365,7,1,30,ISFP,5,"<no>  You cannot maintain your composure if you are under a lot of pressure. I was under a lot of stress because I had to do an important job at the company that I didn't want to do, and I had hair loss."
366,7,1,30,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I already know. I'm very shy, so I don't know what to say to people I don't know."
367,7,1,30,ISFP,7,"<neutrality>  don't do another project after completely finishing one project. Even when I was studying for the exam, if I studied only one subject, my concentration would drop and nothing caught my eye."
368,7,1,30,ISFP,8,"<no>  A little sentimental, but not very sentimental. There are many times when I don't mind watching sad movies or listening to sad songs."
369,7,1,30,ISFP,9,"<no>  I don't plan out schedules or lists. I often forget to take notes and it's annoying, so I don't bother."
370,7,1,30,ISFP,10,"<no>  I do not doubt my ability or knowledge. Everyone can make mistakes and each person has a different breadth of knowledge, so I haven't had that kind of experience lately."
371,7,1,30,ISFP,11,"<no>  It's difficult for me to approach him first and start a conversation. There was a person I was interested in a long time ago, but I couldn't approach him first and talk to him, so I lost contact."
372,7,1,30,ISFP,12,<Yes>  am not very interested in discussions of interpretation. I don't like discussions about art because it's like bragging about knowledge.
373,7,1,30,ISFP,13,"<no>  It's more emotional than rational. Even when I think about it, people around me often hear that I am emotional."
374,7,1,30,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  Rather than planning a schedule for the day, I improvise and deal with things that come to mind at the time. I tend to travel a lot unplanned."
375,7,1,30,ISFP,15,"<neutrality> In the past, I worried about how I would look in the eyes of others, but these days I don't worry about that. I think it's because I'm just too busy living my life."
376,7,1,30,ISFP,16,<no>  Participating in group activities is not enjoyable. I don't really like it because I have to make fun of each other and have to look out for each other.
377,7,1,30,ISFP,17,<no>  I don't like books and movies that interpret the ending the way I want. I hate it because I keep thinking about what the writer wanted the ending to be.
378,7,1,30,ISFP,18,"<neutrality>  I don't feel any greater satisfaction in helping others to succeed, but when I think that person has succeeded because of me, I get jealous, but I also feel proud."
379,7,1,30,ISFP,19,"<Yes>  There are so many interests these days that I often don't know what to do first. These days, I'm into camping, video editing, and traveling, so I can't do anything properly."
380,7,1,30,ISFP,20,<no>  I don't worry about things going wrong. I tend to just do it once and watch it. I tend to think that worrying doesn't change anything and only hurts my head.
381,7,1,30,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  I don't want to do leadership dynamics in a group. It's hard to take responsibility for myself, but I think it's difficult and very headache to be responsible for someone else."
382,7,1,30,ISFP,22,<no>  I tend to think that I have some artistic inclinations. People around me often say that I have an artistic sense.
383,7,1,30,ISFP,23,"<no>  If people valued reason more than emotion, I think the world would be very broken and overflowing with very selfish people."
384,7,1,30,ISFP,24,"<no>  do housework first and don't take a break. Right now, when my physical condition is too difficult, I tend to take a break and do housework. It's hard, but even if I do housework, I feel like it's messy even after cleaning."
385,7,1,30,ISFP,25,"<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. I don't like fighting itself, so I tend to hate arguments."
386,7,1,30,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to try to attract other people's attention. It's because I'm the shy type, so if I drag people around, I'm the only one who gets tired and tired."
387,7,1,30,ISFP,27,"<neutrality>  Emotions may or may not change very quickly. I tend to get angry right away when my boyfriend makes me angry, but I don't think my sad feelings change quickly."
388,7,1,30,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  I don't think I work efficiently either, but I felt that way a lot when I saw kids who didn't even know basic words when I was educating newcomers at the company in the past."
389,7,1,30,ISFP,29,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to put off professional work until the last minute, but I often put off things like housework until the last minute."
390,7,1,30,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  Because I am very interested in the afterlife, I think everything about the afterlife is interesting. I think I'm interested in it because it's amazing that there are other worlds that we can't see."
391,7,1,30,ISFP,31,<no>  tend to prefer spending time alone rather than spending time with other people. I think being alone is more comfortable and more comfortable.
392,7,1,30,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  Whether theoretical or principled, I tend to think that discussion itself is boring. Just thinking about something is boring."
393,7,1,30,ISFP,33,<no>  I can't easily relate to people from completely different backgrounds than mine. I think it's hard to understand each other if we grew up in different environments.
394,7,1,30,ISFP,34,"<neutrality>  I tend to put off making decisions until the end, or I tend to make decisions all at once. When there are people around me, I tend to think carefully before making a decision, and when it comes to my own thoughts and decisions, I tend to make decisions based on what I am attracted to."
395,7,1,30,ISFP,35,"<neutrality>  try not to think twice about decisions I have already made. If I think about it again, not only I but also the people around me often get tired, so I don't try to think again."
396,7,1,30,ISFP,36,"<no>  Rather than parties or events, I like to spend time alone. I really like to rest quietly at a quiet campsite or at home."
397,7,1,30,ISFP,37,"<neutrality>  also like going to see works of art that I like. I like going to see things related to movies, musicals, sound, and video art. I'm not very interested in other artistic things."
398,7,1,30,ISFP,38,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it's hard to understand other people's feelings. Recently, people around me had something to be sad about, so I thought why not to be sad about that much."
399,7,1,30,ISFP,39,<no>  I do a lot of improvisation rather than planning my daily to-dos. I think living according to a plan is tiring.
400,7,1,30,ISFP,40,<Yes>  I don't feel very anxious. I think it's an innate personality. There are a lot of things I just do and move on.
401,7,1,30,ISFP,41,"<Yes>  I want to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. When I talk on the phone, I feel like we have to talk for a long time, and somehow I feel like I'm in a hurry, so I don't really want to do it."
402,7,1,30,ISFP,42,"<neutrality> If you have a very different opinion from someone else, you spend a lot of time and don't try to understand them. I tend to assume that that person has their own thoughts and move on."
403,7,1,30,ISFP,43,<no>  I'm not the type to contact my friends first and ask them to meet. I tend to meet up when my friends contact me first and ask to meet up.
404,7,1,30,ISFP,44,"<no> If my plan goes wrong, I tend to look for other solutions rather than going back to the original plan. I recently booked a campsite, but when my car broke down and I couldn't go there, I changed it to another outing."
405,7,1,30,ISFP,45,"<Yes>  When I regret the mistakes I made a long time ago, I am regretting that these days, after my father passed away, I felt like I couldn't do anything and only hurt my heart."
406,7,1,30,ISFP,46,"<Yes>  tend not to think deeply about human existence and life. I live because I was born, and I tend to think that I live because I have a dream."
407,7,1,30,ISFP,47,"<neutrality>  I can control my emotions, and I tend to be swayed by them a lot. I tend to think the same way around me."
408,7,1,30,ISFP,48,"<no>  If the other party clearly did something wrong, I think it should be reported to the other party and corrected. That way you won't make the same mistake next time."
421,8,0,20,ENTP,1,"<neutrality>  Making new friends is exciting, but I prefer hanging out with old friends."
422,8,0,20,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  I invest a significant amount of my free time looking for videos related to my interests. These days, I'm interested in bowling and sport climbing."
423,8,0,20,ENTP,3,"<no>  When I see someone else crying, I sympathize with that person's sad feelings, but it seems that there are very few cases where tears come out."
424,8,0,20,ENTP,4,<Yes>  I tend to get a lot of stress when faced with unexpected unexpected situations. So I tend to consider the number of cases.
425,8,0,20,ENTP,5,"<no>  I tend to shake a lot when I feel pressure. Recently, when I was betting on bowling with my friends, I was upset because I made a mistake at an important moment."
426,8,0,20,ENTP,6,"<neutrality> Depends on the mood. At a light party with alcohol or at a place where I am the manager, I go around introducing myself here and there, but at a quiet gathering, I prefer to have small talk with my acquaintances."
427,8,0,20,ENTP,7,"<neutrality>  I like to juggle several things at once, but sometimes I get stuck on something and I can't get out of it."
428,8,0,20,ENTP,8,"<no>  I'm on the rational side. Recently, I heard that I was a destroyer of impressions because I gave a realistic answer to the words of an emotional friend."
429,8,0,20,ENTP,9,"<neutrality>  They make plans, but prefer to do things verbally with the people they work with, not with tools."
430,8,0,20,ENTP,10,"<Yes>  Recently, I hesitated at the moment when I had to make a decision, and later reversed it. It's a small thing, but it keeps bothering me and makes me look shabby."
431,8,0,20,ENTP,11,"<neutrality> It depends on the condition of the day. On days when my condition is good and my self-esteem is high, I easily approach and talk to him, but I want to avoid it when I am not."
432,8,0,20,ENTP,12,"<no>  Diverse views on art should be respected and it's fun. Recently, I often watch movie interpretations from the point of view of people who are not the main characters."
433,8,0,20,ENTP,13,"<neutrality>  In many cases, work is handled rationally, but it seems that there are quite a few cases of emotional response when it comes to private rather than public affairs."
434,8,0,20,ENTP,14,"<neutrality>  I like to spend my days freely, but I think there are many cases where I feel more proud when I finish the day with a plan."
435,8,0,20,ENTP,15,"<no>  I tend to be very conscious of other people's eyes. If you feel the eyes of others, your body will strain a little."
436,8,0,20,ENTP,16,"<Yes> These days, we have become more involved in group activities, often setting up meetings and dinners to meet people."
437,8,0,20,ENTP,17,"<neutrality>  The open ending doesn't give a clear feeling, so I don't like it after watching it, but it's nice to be able to meet various endings through many people's interpretation."
438,8,0,20,ENTP,18,"<neutrality>  Helping others succeed is wonderful, but in the process, you must also ensure your own success and growth."
439,8,0,20,ENTP,19,"<neutrality>  Bowling and sport climbing are my current interests, but both activities are too physically demanding to handle, so it's difficult to arrange time for them."
440,8,0,20,ENTP,20,"<Yes>  I tend to make a lot of minor mistakes, so I often worry that things will go wrong. I'm still checking to see if the spacing is good."
441,8,0,20,ENTP,21,"<neutrality>  like to take the lead, but a position with a lot of responsibility is just as stressful, so I don't step forward. However, if it is a group assignment, I am willing to do it."
442,8,0,20,ENTP,22,"<no>  I tend to be good at taking pictures, but I think I have an artistic sense of framing or capturing and directing good situations."
443,8,0,20,ENTP,23,"<no>  Reason and emotion are mutually complementary, so I think the world works well only when they are balanced to some extent."
444,8,0,20,ENTP,24,"<no>  tend to rush to work, so I tend to take a good rest first and then focus on housework."
445,8,0,20,ENTP,25,"<Yes>  If it's a constructive discussion rather than just a verbal fight, I think it's interesting to watch it and get different opinions."
446,8,0,20,ENTP,26,"<neutrality>  I get nervous when I receive attention, but on the other hand, I feel thrilled and energized. Especially when you do something you're good at, you do things to attract attention."
447,8,0,20,ENTP,27,"<Yes>  I tend to have severe emotional ups and downs. Even if I have a good mood with my girlfriend, if I do something I don't like, my mood drops sharply."
448,8,0,20,ENTP,28,<Yes>  There are many cases where a friend who works together is frustrated by taking time to concentrate on a task that can be completed quickly.
449,8,0,20,ENTP,29,"<Yes>  tend to procrastinate as much as possible to get things done, but recently I had to rush through a document I had to submit until the deadline."
450,8,0,20,ENTP,30,"<Yes>  I often think about my existence and what happens after I die, which is quite interesting. I think the fact that many cultural heritages originate from the afterlife supports this."
451,8,0,20,ENTP,31,<Yes>  I enjoy going out and meeting and talking with friends more than spending time alone at home.
452,8,0,20,ENTP,32,"<no>  Due to the nature of my major, I learn about various theorists, and through this, I enjoy talking about various views with my classmates."
453,8,0,20,ENTP,33,"<no>  Recently, when I was talking, there were cases where I unknowingly made comments or judgments that reflected prejudice."
454,8,0,20,ENTP,34,"<Yes>  often change my decision and I tend to regret it, so it seems that there are many cases where I put off prudence until the moment I have to make a decision, and then do it when the deadline is imminent."
455,8,0,20,ENTP,35,"<no>  When I can't sleep, I often spend time rethinking and regretting past decisions."
456,8,0,20,ENTP,36,"<neutrality>  If your physical strength is low, you can recover from fatigue by sleeping alone, but in other cases, it seems to be more helpful to be with friends."
457,8,0,20,ENTP,37,"<neutrality>  Rather than appreciating the work itself, I seem to like seeing interpretations of it."
458,8,0,20,ENTP,38,"<no>  I often don't understand other people's behavior, but I tend to empathize with their feelings."
459,8,0,20,ENTP,39,"<no>  I like having a certain amount of plans, but I think having a plan every day feels stuffy."
460,8,0,20,ENTP,40,"<no> It has improved a lot compared to the past, but I still often feel uneasy about the cause."
461,8,0,20,ENTP,41,"<neutrality>  Prefers to talk face-to-face rather than talking on the phone, but does not avoid talking on the phone if necessary."
462,8,0,20,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  While working on a project, I sometimes get criticized for the agenda that I thought was the best, but when I do this, I worry a lot about why the other person thinks that way."
463,8,0,20,ENTP,43,"<Yes>  This is the style of contacting or visiting friends to meet them first. Lately, I've been making a lot of dinner tables."
464,8,0,20,ENTP,44,"<no>  Once the plan is disrupted, I get stressed and think that the original plan has already been ruined, so I tend to turn to the other side. When I was recently offered a job, I turned it down rather than modify it because it was not what I had planned."
465,8,0,20,ENTP,45,<Yes>  I often think of and regret the case when I made an emotional decision and acted when I should have made a rational decision.
466,8,0,20,ENTP,46,"<no>  Sometimes when I feel a gap between my senses and reality, I think about whether it is right for me to be alive."
467,8,0,20,ENTP,47,"<neutrality>  When it comes to public affairs, I think I make good judgments rationally, but in private situations, I often respond emotionally to trivial matters."
468,8,0,20,ENTP,48,"<neutrality>  When the matter is serious or in public, we try to save the other person's face, but in private, we make fun of it."
481,9,1,20,ENTP,1,"<Yes>  I don't keep in touch often, so people around me usually become friends. At that moment, the people who are active closest to me become friends, so I make friends whenever my interests change."
482,9,1,20,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  Same things, like games or one hobby, and have a hard time keeping it up for a long time. These days, I like to watch many people's vlogs on YouTube and see how people living in the world live in various ways and what kind of lives are different from mine."
483,9,1,20,ENTP,3,"<no>  I am a person who cries only when I am sad, so if the other person is crying for any reason, I tend to listen to the reason and try to calm him down. It's pretty embarrassing to shed tears for reasons that have nothing to do with me."
484,9,1,20,ENTP,4,"<no> In my opinion, even if you make a countermeasure, I don't think that countermeasure can be an accurate countermeasure. First of all, I think that everything starts anew from the moment things go wrong, and I solve things with flexibility that suits the situation at that moment."
485,9,1,20,ENTP,5,"<Yes>  rarely feel pressure in my daily life, but recently, in the midst of Chuseok, I suddenly felt the pressure of driving a long distance. Even though 5 hours had passed since the car was hit by traffic jam, it was still a long time before we arrived, so I thought what to do if there was an accident, but I thought about what to do if there was an accident."
486,9,1,20,ENTP,6,<no>  I like to talk first to the first person I'm interested in because I prefer getting to know people I don't know rather than people I know.
487,9,1,20,ENTP,7,"<no>  Rather than solving things sequentially, if there are 10 tasks, I tend to start 10 at the same time. I like working out after work, preparing for exams, doing various things in my spare time and getting results from each of them."
488,9,1,20,ENTP,8,"<no>  am a person who can only say that delicious things are delicious when you go out to eat with others. Even if you look at the wonderful scenery, you will end up saying that it is pretty. Even if there are many thoughts in my head, the words that come out are limited."
489,9,1,20,ENTP,9,"<Yes>  Because I have to exercise regularly and unconditionally, I have to make other appointments according to my exercise schedule, so I have no choice but to check my schedule on my cell phone and live a planned life."
490,9,1,20,ENTP,10,"<no>  have good resilience, so if I make a small mistake, I immediately forget that I made a mistake with the thought that everyone makes mistakes."
491,9,1,20,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  Since I have a lot of questions about the person I'm interested in, I immediately ask about their current interests, starting with where they live. At my current job, new employees come once a week, and every time they come, they jokingly say that they will interview, and then talk."
492,9,1,20,ENTP,12,"<no>  Because I like daydreaming, I like and prefer everything that I can talk about using my imagination rather than things with fixed answers."
493,9,1,20,ENTP,13,"<Yes> When a close colleague makes a mistake at work and gets scolded and tells me about it, I listen to the whole story and if the friend's mistake is correct, I say, ""You did it."" Knowing that, my friends don't tell me if they've done something really wrong, or they confide in me when they want to hear the real bitterness objectively."
494,9,1,20,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  Even on the way home from work, when the wind blows coolly and the day is nice, I suddenly have the idea to go on a picnic, and I put it into practice right away."
495,9,1,20,ENTP,15,"<Yes>  Because I knew from a very early age that people weren't interested in me more than I thought, and because I tend to speak very straightforwardly, if I were to live in Korea with this kind of personality, I couldn't live without worrying about what kind of person I would look like."
496,9,1,20,ENTP,16,"<Yes> Mostly, if you make an appointment, there are many appointments for 5 or more people. Even if there are only 3 close friends, it is very enjoyable, but if there are 10 people, the fun is doubled."
497,9,1,20,ENTP,17,"<no>  Books and movies like endings. For example, if the ending ends ambiguous whether the main character dies or not, I go crazy wondering what happened in the end."
498,9,1,20,ENTP,18,"<Yes>  can be the owner of a store, but I think a store manager who is good at work is more suitable for my aptitude and I can do it well. Because I don't want to be responsible."
499,9,1,20,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  When I was doing various activities on my cell phone, I had more than 10 apps turned on, and 10 of them had nothing to do with it."
500,9,1,20,ENTP,20,<no>  hate worrying about things that don't even happen. I think these are the most unnecessary things. It's not too late to think about it after things go wrong.
501,9,1,20,ENTP,21,"<no>  I don't think it's cool to keep avoiding and dodging in order not to play the role of a leader. I don't think it's difficult to take on the role of a leader if your voice is loud, but I have a loud voice."
502,9,1,20,ENTP,22,"<no>  I did hobby art for fun, but I thought I had a hidden talent because I did well enough to be praised by others."
503,9,1,20,ENTP,23,"<no>  I'm a rational person, but if you think that everyone is like me, the world would be a bit unlucky. It's emotional, so it seems beautiful when people live together."
504,9,1,20,ENTP,24,"<no>  On really hard days, I put everything off. I think doing it after resting is for me."
505,9,1,20,ENTP,25,"<Yes> One of the funniest spectacles in the world is watching other people fight. Looking at what you say, I think about what position I am in."
506,9,1,20,ENTP,26,<Yes>  What would I do if I got attention from people I'm not interested in? I hope others don't look as carefully as possible.
507,9,1,20,ENTP,27,"<Yes>  Even if there are things that get angry, after talking about those things to someone, I quickly forget it and become calm."
508,9,1,20,ENTP,28,"<Yes>  I didn't understand people who couldn't do as well as me while working. So I became a pretty bad senior at my previous job, and it was only after I changed jobs that I understood how difficult it was. I understand, but it's not that I'm not annoyed. I did it too, but I think a lot about why I can¡¯t."
509,9,1,20,ENTP,29,"<Yes> When I get home, I have a lot of chores to do, but I put it off and watch YouTube. I procrastinate cleaning the bathroom, and I do it when I really can't stand it."
510,9,1,20,ENTP,30,<Yes>  I like to talk about undefined things that no one knows exactly. Because I like to talk about the things I imagined.
511,9,1,20,ENTP,31,"<neutrality>  I like spending time with people, but I also need time alone. If you meet friends during the day, you should be alone at night."
512,9,1,20,ENTP,32,"<Yes>  I am not interested in a theory because it must have a basis. I like non-logic stories. Like the recently popular balance game, I like non-rooted discussions. For example, the debate about having one buttock or two."
513,9,1,20,ENTP,33,"<no>  I can only relate to what I've experienced. Even if you can pretend to sympathize with them on the outside, on the inside you think what they're saying."
514,9,1,20,ENTP,34,"<no>  Even if you make an appointment, immediately designate a date, ask, hold it, and if you make up your mind to do something, you must practice and execute it right away."
515,9,1,20,ENTP,35,"<Yes>  The assumption that this had not been done is superfluous. You have to accept the decisions you've already made, whether or not they have good results, and deal with them. If you didn't do this, there's no need. It's already been decided."
516,9,1,20,ENTP,36,"<neutrality>  Things like parties and events are scheduled on Saturdays for the past 6 weeks and for the next 7 weeks. If you have a party on Saturday, you should be alone on Sunday."
517,9,1,20,ENTP,37,<Yes>  I like going to art galleries as long as it's accessible. I like to look at paintings and think about useless things.
518,9,1,20,ENTP,38,"<Yes>  It is really difficult for a woman in Korea to live with a T tendency. Most women have a lot of F's, but when they talk, they often run into difficulties. For example, if there is a difficult task, I have to show emotional empathy, but I am the type to offer solutions, so there have been many occasions when I have not been able to give the other person the answer they want."
519,9,1,20,ENTP,39,"<no> On my days off, I do whatever I want. I really need to lie down and rest today, so when a friend calls me, I often go out of the house."
520,9,1,20,ENTP,40,<Yes>  I don't think about anything that would make me feel anxious. No worries. I think a lot about how it will work out. Only things that can be solved happen in life. What can I do if I can't fix it...
521,9,1,20,ENTP,41,"<no> I'm a person who can't text more, so I like to make phone calls. Because when you call, you have to focus on the phone... When you text, it's easy to distract yourself from contact."
522,9,1,20,ENTP,42,"<no>  My opinion is my opinion, and other people's opinions are other people's opinions. You're thinking like that. I think so."
523,9,1,20,ENTP,43,"<Yes>  98% of the appointments in my schedule are the ones I hold. Since I don't keep in touch, I often talk to him about making an appointment when I get a chance."
524,9,1,20,ENTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, I think we need to come up with another plan quickly. When I go on a trip and can't go to the restaurant I want to go to, or if the line is too long, I go to any restaurant where I can eat without waiting."
525,9,1,20,ENTP,45,<no>  I tend to think that I am stable now because I made mistakes a long time ago. A person who learns from mistakes.
526,9,1,20,ENTP,46,"<no>  A famous monk said that you shouldn't think about why you were born, but I think a lot about why, so I think a lot about why people live and what their purpose is before going to bed."
527,9,1,20,ENTP,47,<no>  I think the most pathetic people who take out their anger on others just because they are angry. Don't let your emotions become your attitude and actions is one of your mottos in life.
528,9,1,20,ENTP,48,"<no>  Even if the other person has a higher rank than me, I will never do anything to say that I did nothing wrong or to save face. Unless you got paid..."
541,10,1,20,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality>  He doesn't push away anyone who approaches him, but he doesn't even bother trying to meet new friends."
542,10,1,20,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  tend to look for news or videos to learn more about the field I am interested in. These days, I am interested in the field of economics."
543,10,1,20,ESTJ,3,<no>  Seeing someone else crying has never made me want to cry. I feel like I need to comfort you because I'm just crying.
544,10,1,20,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to make plans in case things go wrong. That way, it's easier to respond when something happens."
545,10,1,20,ESTJ,5,"<Yes>  Because if you feel extreme anxiety in a high-pressure environment, nothing will work. I try to keep my composure and make objective and rational judgments as much as possible. Recently, I was feeling a lot of pressure about choosing a thesis topic, but I didn't feel anxious and took the topic step by step."
546,10,1,20,ESTJ,6,"<neutrality>  have conversations with people I know, and if necessary, I tend to introduce myself to new people first. This is because I think doing this will help expand your network."
547,10,1,20,ESTJ,7,"<no>  If there is a project that can be solved quickly, or if I judge that I can work on several projects at the same time, I will work on several at the same time."
548,10,1,20,ESTJ,8,<no>  I've never heard of being sentimental. I'm rarely touched by anything or overly emotional.
549,10,1,20,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  I usually use a planner to organize my schedule, and when I study, I make long-term and short-term plans and proceed as planned."
550,10,1,20,ESTJ,10,"<Yes>  I made a mistake on a test that I studied really hard and got one question wrong, but I felt that the whole process of studying was in vain and I doubted my abilities. I blamed myself thinking that if I had studied more carefully, I would not have made a mistake."
551,10,1,20,ESTJ,11,"<Yes>  In most cases, it was not difficult to approach, start a conversation, and carry on a conversation. It is not difficult to appeal to myself."
552,10,1,20,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  I like looking at works of art, but I am not very interested in various interpretations. I don't even want to discuss various interpretations."
553,10,1,20,ESTJ,13,"<Yes> When I judge, I don't often make decisions based on my emotions. My friends around me also rate me the same."
554,10,1,20,ESTJ,14,<no>  Doing something spontaneously is uncomfortable. It is convenient to have a planned schedule. I tend to manage my schedule through a planner.
555,10,1,20,ESTJ,15,"<Yes>  People who hate me are not interested in me anyway because they will hate me no matter what I do. However, I tend to act to the extent that I am not criticized socially."
556,10,1,20,ESTJ,16,"<Yes>  When I meet up with friends, I enjoy meeting a lot in groups. Recently, I met several of my high school classmates and had drinks and played games."
557,10,1,20,ESTJ,17,"<no>  I don't like open endings. A work that has a clear ending is good. I haven't seen a movie lately, so I don't have a recent favourite."
558,10,1,20,ESTJ,18,"<no>  I am not very interested in the success of others. It's okay to help if you can, but I don't feel very satisfied in the process. Perhaps, it's because I think that helping others succeed is my simple favor."
559,10,1,20,ESTJ,19,"<no> Even if I have a lot of interests, I tend to invest my time first in the ones I am more curious about. Recently, I was contemplating whether to watch a video related to history or a video related to the economy first, but I watched an economic video that I was more interested in first."
560,10,1,20,ESTJ,20,"<Yes>  Even if you prepare in advance for fear that things will go wrong, you are always anxious about failure. There's nothing that I can think of as an opportunity, it just seems to have been a habit since I was young."
561,10,1,20,ESTJ,21,"<neutrality>  don't have to avoid it, but I don't have to do it either. However, if I take on the role of a leader, I have the confidence to do it well without hurting others."
562,10,1,20,ESTJ,22,<no>  I like art or crafts. And crafting is actually a hobby I do a lot. There is no artistic inclination.
563,10,1,20,ESTJ,23,"<Yes> If you look at the comments on articles on the Internet, you will see a lot of comments that are biased towards emotion. Even if you think about it a little rationally, it doesn't make sense. Maybe if you thought rationally, the world would have been a little better."
564,10,1,20,ESTJ,24,"<Yes>  It is comfortable to rest only when all housework is done. If you don't finish the housework first, you feel uncomfortable, and you feel anxious that you haven't completed all the tasks to be done. It is comfortable to do housework and rest."
565,10,1,20,ESTJ,25,"<no> These days, the subject of debate is sensitive and overheated. And such arguments are unpleasant to watch because they are accompanied by curses."
566,10,1,20,ESTJ,26,<Yes>  I tend to just want to be buried among people. I don't want to go out and draw attention.
567,10,1,20,ESTJ,27,"<Yes>  I'm sensitive, so my feelings change drastically over trivial things. There is a side to me that even if I was depressed because I was sick, I felt better when I ate something delicious."
568,10,1,20,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  When I worked in marketing for a while, I had a hard time teaching others. I got really annoyed and angry when I learned it once and did it right, but others couldn¡¯t do it right even after learning it three times. I've already inefficiently spent my time teaching that person, because that person even did his job inefficiently."
569,10,1,20,ESTJ,29,<no>  I rarely put things off until the end. I haven't been procrastinating lately either. I try not to procrastinate because mistakes are often made if I rush things by putting them off until the end.
570,10,1,20,ESTJ,30,"<Yes>  It is interesting that no one knows the afterlife until death. I don't think there will be scientifically, but I keep thinking that there may be something after death."
571,10,1,20,ESTJ,31,<Yes>  I often feel down when I am alone. I prefer to spend time with other people because it allows me to focus on that time. The same goes for recent times.
572,10,1,20,ESTJ,32,"<no>  I think it's interesting to talk about the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. In fact, I tend to talk a lot about this with my friends around me and have a lot of discussions about what the universe is like."
573,10,1,20,ESTJ,33,"<no>  There are different kinds of people and different kinds of backgrounds in the world. And among them, there were people who had completely different situations than mine. Honestly, there was a time when it was difficult to empathize with someone who had a very different family environment from mine."
574,10,1,20,ESTJ,34,"<no>  I prefer to make decisions quickly. If you drag it all the way to the end, it's because it's me who will end up having a hard time."
575,10,1,20,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  Since the decision was made after careful consideration based on sufficient grounds before the decision, I do not reconsider the decision I have already made unless there are special circumstances. There are fewer repetitions."
576,10,1,20,ESTJ,36,"<neutrality>  There are times when I spend time with many people at fun social events, and there are times when I spend time alone. These days, I spend a lot of time alone because I am in a foreign country."
577,10,1,20,ESTJ,37,<Yes>  I like to appreciate art. Because looking at pretty pictures makes you feel good.
578,10,1,20,ESTJ,38,"<Yes>  When you meet someone who wants unconditional empathy, it's hard to understand their feelings. No matter what solution you suggest, it is meaningless to that person."
579,10,1,20,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  tend to plan things to do every day, and I tend to organize both work and personal things in advance so I don't forget them."
580,10,1,20,ESTJ,40,"<no>  A lot of times I feel insecure. Ever since I was little, I was often anxious and worried about trivial things."
581,10,1,20,ESTJ,41,"<neutrality>  I am not afraid to make phone calls if necessary. However, I think that it is more certain to communicate with each other through text messages or KakaoTalk."
582,10,1,20,ESTJ,42,"<neutrality>  I invest a lot of time when I decide that opinions different from my own are worth considering, but I don't try to understand them when they are close to one-sided tantrums. It's mainly when talking about politics."
583,10,1,20,ESTJ,43,"<Yes>  I told my university classmates yesterday that we should meet first. Meeting up with friends is fun, so contact them first to make an appointment."
584,10,1,20,ESTJ,44,"<neutrality>  Usually, plans are laid out leisurely in case of setbacks, so I don't try to get back to them as quickly as possible. I tend to check for problems first. That's not to say there's no going back to plan."
585,10,1,20,ESTJ,45,<Yes>  I still remember the mistake I made while presenting in presentation class a year ago. Try not to make the same mistake again.
586,10,1,20,ESTJ,46,"<Yes>  If you keep thinking about the reason for human existence and life, there is no bottom and no end. You can think infinitely. I don't think deeply because I think it's better to stick to the present rather than thinking like this."
587,10,1,20,ESTJ,47,"<no>  I have a lot of emotional ups and downs, but I tend to try not to show them off. I've never ruined a job because of my emotions. The evaluation of the surroundings is also the same."
588,10,1,20,ESTJ,48,"<neutrality>  I don't openly embarrass myself in front of others, but I tend to speak privately. It is because there is no progress if the other person does not know that it is the other person's fault."
601,11,1,20,ENFJ,1,"<neutrality>  I'm comfortable with friends I've known before, but I enjoy meeting new people, so I tend to make new friends from time to time."
602,11,1,20,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  I tend to be interested in various things, so I tend to dedicate myself to exploring my interests. These days, I'm into home baking. I am trying to find out how to make and decorate various cookies, breads and cakes."
603,11,1,20,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  When the other person is crying, it feels like that feeling is conveyed, so I want to cry with him and feel the feelings he feels."
604,11,1,20,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  In order to not panic when things go wrong, but to find a breakthrough so that things can be carried out as planned. I tend to get annoyed when things don't go according to plan."
605,11,1,20,ENFJ,5,"<neutrality>  When I have a job interview or a difficult meeting with a superior, I try to keep my composure as much as possible and have a conversation, but sometimes it shows through my facial expression."
606,11,1,20,ENFJ,6,"<neutrality>  After saying hello and talking about the current situation with people I already know, when a new person is nearby and I need to make eye contact or have a conversation, then I say hello first."
607,11,1,20,ENFJ,7,"<Yes>  Sometimes, if things get messy while doing many things at the same time, sometimes things can't go as planned, so I finish one thing completely and start another to prevent the plan from getting messed up."
608,11,1,20,ENFJ,8,<Yes>  More judgments are driven by emotions rather than rational judgments. That's why it's more frequent to solve things before emotions.
609,11,1,20,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  I mark most important things, things I must do, and personal appointments on a diary or calendar."
610,11,1,20,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  I made a mistake while doing simple editing or classification, and at times like that, I feel like I can't even do something simple like this."
611,11,1,20,ENFJ,11,"<neutrality>  I'm careful about how I look because I'm someone I'm interested in, but I do a lot of trivial things like saying hello first or offering a cup of coffee to let that person know who I am."
612,11,1,20,ENFJ,12,"<no>  Interpretation of a work of art differs from person to person depending on gender, age, values, etc., so it is good to know information about various perspectives."
613,11,1,20,ENFJ,13,"<no>  Emotions usually take precedence, and people around me say so. When you need to put your emotions a little less ahead, you are told to exercise some restraint."
614,11,1,20,ENFJ,14,"<no>  Very occasionally I do things that I want to improvise, but usually I tend to have a plan and organize what needs to be done."
615,11,1,20,ENFJ,15,<no>  tend to think for myself how that person will view me and try to refrain from acting. I don't show myself well because my evaluation differs depending on the person.
616,11,1,20,ENFJ,16,"<neutrality>  Except when I feel like I need to rest by myself, I like hanging out with people, so I tend to go out for coffee or go for a drive."
617,11,1,20,ENFJ,17,"<Yes> It's fun to find out what the difference is between the ending I thought and the ending others think. Because it can broaden your perspective and change your thinking. So, recently I was obsessed with the decision to break up with the movie."
618,11,1,20,ENFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I am proud of the fact that I have helped others to succeed. But I don't help unconditionally, and there are times when I'm more important than others."
619,11,1,20,ENFJ,19,"<no>  Usually, when one interest cools down a bit, I tend to look for other interests, so I don¡¯t know what to do next. While making DIY candles, I naturally lost interest, and recently my interest has shifted to home baking. No conflict at all."
620,11,1,20,ENFJ,20,"<Yes>  When I make plans for most things, I think about various situations, so there are many things that naturally lead to worry."
621,11,1,20,ENFJ,21,"<neutrality>  I tend to take on the role of leader when there is no one I want to do or when there is no one who is suitable for the role, but if there is someone who is suitable for the role, I do not hesitate to do it."
622,11,1,20,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I enjoy the pleasure that leads to imagination, and I like seeing, feeling, thinking, and directly experiencing art."
623,11,1,20,ENFJ,23,"<no> There are things in the world that cannot be solved with reason alone. If you think about your feelings a little more, you will often get better results."
624,11,1,20,ENFJ,24,<Yes>  It's good to finish housework neatly and rest refreshed without worrying about anything that bothers you.
625,11,1,20,ENFJ,25,"<Yes>  If you look at other people's arguments, it's the same situation, but you can see that each person accepts and feels differently."
626,11,1,20,ENFJ,26,"<neutrality>  don't want to draw attention to situations where I don't want to step out or when I'm not in a position to step out. If that's not the case, it's fun to grab attention and entertain."
627,11,1,20,ENFJ,27,"<Yes>  I have a wide range of emotions. Even if I feel really good, I get angry right away with a word or even a small action."
628,11,1,20,ENFJ,28,"<Yes> Obviously, if I do things the way I do, it would take 10 minutes, but it only takes 5 minutes, but I feel frustrated and annoyed when I see people who do things without doing that. Even though I said it would be nice to do it this way."
629,11,1,20,ENFJ,29,"<no>  I tend to make plans and stick to them, so I rarely procrastinate. If you put off work, other plans will also go awry."
630,11,1,20,ENFJ,30,"<Yes>  The afterlife is a field that is difficult to experience and cannot be told by those who have experienced it, so it is interesting because there are various imaginations and perspectives."
631,11,1,20,ENFJ,31,"<neutrality>  After spending time with other people, of course, I am happy and happy, but time alone to take care of myself is also important. These days, the time I spend with other people and the time I take care of myself seem to be 5:5."
632,11,1,20,ENFJ,32,"<no>  Theories and original stories are central to all stories. Without them, I think it's just light chatter. For example, in diseases or crimes."
633,11,1,20,ENFJ,33,"<Yes>  Even if the background is completely different, the things you experience can be the same, and most of the emotions you feel from those experiences are similar, so it's easy to relate."
634,11,1,20,ENFJ,34,"<no>  I think about it until the very end, but I tend to make a decision and finish it because I have to do the next thing."
635,11,1,20,ENFJ,35,"<neutrality>  don't tend to think twice about decisions I've made with certainty, but I sometimes think about what it would have been like if I had made a different decision or if it was the right decision to continue working on the next one."
636,11,1,20,ENFJ,36,"<neutrality>  I tend to relieve stress with fun parties and events. But these days, there are times when I need personal time, so I often spend time alone."
637,11,1,20,ENFJ,37,<Yes>  i like you. I enjoy looking for it on purpose and thinking about things while watching it. It's fun to look for reviews and find different perspectives.
638,11,1,20,ENFJ,38,"<neutrality>  In most things, I tend to understand other people's feelings. However, it is difficult to understand when it comes to extremely self-centered thinking or making excuses for one's own face when the person himself did something wrong."
639,11,1,20,ENFJ,39,<Yes>  I feel comfortable making plans. I prefer to digest my schedule as planned without any deviations.
640,11,1,20,ENFJ,40,"<Yes>  tend to feel a lot of insecurity, perhaps because I have an emotional personality. When I think about something, I think it's more because I worry about the worst situation."
641,11,1,20,ENFJ,41,"<no>  Rather, it is convenient to make a phone call. It's nice to be able to organize things quickly and talk about various things besides work. Voice is easier to convey emotions than text."
642,11,1,20,ENFJ,42,"<Yes> When I talk to various people, I hear stories that are completely different from mine, and I tend to think about them and look for them. Then my thoughts change, and new perspectives arise."
643,11,1,20,ENFJ,43,"<Yes>  If you find a place you want to go or a food you want to eat, contact the people you think of and ask them to meet you."
644,11,1,20,ENFJ,44,"<Yes> The work I was doing was postponed due to the other person's schedule, so my plans were disrupted. If that happens, other work will gradually be pushed behind, so I finished the work after a long discussion with the other person."
645,11,1,20,ENFJ,45,<Yes>  I often think that the words I said because I understand the other person's situation might have hurt that person.
646,11,1,20,ENFJ,46,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I think about why humans exist, whether it is my will to live my life, or whether I am living in a story someone else has unfolded."
647,11,1,20,ENFJ,47,<neutrality>  I tend to try my best not to be swayed. There are things you need to control your emotions. Maybe that's why people around me sometimes hear that I'm calm.
648,11,1,20,ENFJ,48,<no>  I would never cover up a person for the sake of his face when he made an obvious mistake. You should know that you are wrong for the sake of the next one.
661,12,1,30,ESFP,1,<Yes>  I usually have good relationships with people I meet in my new environment and I make new friends. I think we get to know each other naturally.
662,12,1,30,ESFP,2,"<neutrality>  When I have free time, I spend time decorating my house. These days, I'm creating and decorating my home Instagram account."
663,12,1,30,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  tend to cry with others when they cry. I have good empathy, so I tend to empathize a lot depending on how others feel."
664,12,1,30,ESFP,4,"<no>  I worry a lot when things go wrong, but I'm not the type to make preparations. I tend to believe that time heals things."
665,12,1,30,ESFP,5,"<neutrality>  try to keep my composure in a high-pressure environment, but I think that doesn't work well and my actions show signs of it. Recently, I was studying for a certification exam, but I had an experience of being sensitive all day when I didn't study enough in a situation where the exam was only a few days away."
666,12,1,30,ESFP,6,"<Yes>  I tend not to introduce myself first in new places. It's difficult at first, but once you get to know each other, it's a friendly style."
667,12,1,30,ESFP,7,"<no>  have a hard time sitting down and finishing a project. At the company, I like the way of working by doing one thing, then doing a new job, and then making changes every once in a while."
668,12,1,30,ESFP,8,<Yes>  I am sentimental. People around me often say that I am more emotional and emotional than other people.
669,12,1,30,ESFP,9,"<no>  I usually like to improvise on anything. I bought it to try out the diary, only used it for the first time, and stopped using it after that."
670,12,1,30,ESFP,10,"<neutrality>  If I make a mistake, I tend to lose it quickly. I think everyone can make mistakes and I don't blame myself a lot, but I tend to try not to make the same mistakes again."
671,12,1,30,ESFP,11,"<neutrality>  I think it's more difficult to have a conversation with someone you're interested in. However, if someone introduces me or something, I think they express their desire to be close by talking to me first."
672,12,1,30,ESFP,12,<no>  I like looking at works of art and making various interpretations. I tend to have fun with different interpretations from person to person.
673,12,1,30,ESFP,13,"<Yes>  I think I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. I have an emotional personality, but I think I judge rationally when it comes to judgment. I think there were several times when people around me said that I was rational."
674,12,1,30,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  I think I tend to do things spontaneously. In fact, it seems more like that because even if you make a plan, there are not many things that go according to plan."
675,12,1,30,ESFP,15,"<no>  I tend to value and care about the opinions of others. Sometimes people around me didn't care, but I was told why I care so much."
676,12,1,30,ESFP,16,"<neutrality>  I used to enjoy group activities and get energy from them, but these days I seem to be meeting a small number of people more often. At some point, I felt like I was getting a little tired."
677,12,1,30,ESFP,17,"<Yes>  I like works with open endings. After watching the movie I recently watched, Decision to Break Up, I watched a few videos on YouTube explaining the ending, and I enjoyed the different interpretations."
678,12,1,30,ESFP,18,"<no>  I seem to feel more satisfied with my success. Of course, I feel very rewarded when I help others succeed, but I don't think I feel more satisfaction than my own success."
679,12,1,30,ESFP,19,"<no>  I don't think I'm very interested. If you stick to one interest, there are many experiences that other interests are invisible, so usually when you get out of one interest, you find a new interest."
680,12,1,30,ESFP,20,"<Yes>  I tend to worry a lot. I sometimes worry that things might go wrong, but I overcome my worries by repeating the thought that time will solve everything."
681,12,1,30,ESFP,21,"<Yes>  I like and am good at hanging out with people in a group life, but I would like to avoid a leadership role. It's because I think the ability to lead multiple people is lacking."
682,12,1,30,ESFP,22,"<no>  I think my artistic inclination is superior to others. This is because the work I do itself requires artistry, and I quickly study and experience trends and art."
683,12,1,30,ESFP,23,<no>  think it's important to have a balance between people with emotions and people who value reason more. I wonder if my life has become too hard to focus only on the opposite sex. Whatever is appropriate is important.
684,12,1,30,ESFP,24,"<Yes>  I think it's good to do something hard first and then take a break. It's because if you take a break first without finishing the housework, your body can rest comfortably, but your mind is uncomfortable."
685,12,1,30,ESFP,25,<no>  tend to avoid watching other people's arguments. It's because I think watching the debate itself is tiring.
686,12,1,30,ESFP,26,<neutrality>  There's a little bit of pressure to get attention and focus. But I think I'm on the side of enjoying the attention when people pay attention to me.
687,12,1,30,ESFP,27,"<no>  I'm trying to stay calm. In the same situation where emotions can change rapidly, I tend to keep other people's emotions in check."
688,12,1,30,ESFP,28,"<Yes>  I like to process things efficiently, but I get frustrated and annoyed when I see people who don't."
689,12,1,30,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  I think I procrastinate a lot. It's the same recently, but I don't think I've ever thought about fixing it."
690,12,1,30,ESFP,30,<no>  I have never seriously thought about the afterlife. I'm not too curious.
691,12,1,30,ESFP,31,"<neutrality>  Originally, I like hanging out with other people, but these days I spend a lot of time alone, so I'm used to it, so I don't make many appointments with other people."
692,12,1,30,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in the principled story, and I'm not the type to be interested. So is the theory-based discussion. Even on TV programs, when theory-oriented discussions or principled stories come on, I often change the channel."
693,12,1,30,ESFP,33,<Yes>  I think I have good empathy and I can empathize well in any situation. There are many times when I sympathize and shed tears when I hear the sad stories of celebrities whose backgrounds are completely different from mine.
694,12,1,30,ESFP,34,"<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly. Because the more you think about it, the harder it feels to make a decision."
695,12,1,30,ESFP,35,"<Yes>  I try not to think about the decisions I have already made, and I don't think I'm the type to overturn. I always believe that the decision I made is the right one."
696,12,1,30,ESFP,36,"<neutrality>  These days, rather than gatherings or parties with many people, I tend to talk quietly with my husband and relieve the fatigue of the week."
697,12,1,30,ESFP,37,<Yes>  like to go to art galleries or exhibitions on my holidays. I think the inspiration that comes from that makes me feel good.
698,12,1,30,ESFP,38,<no>  I am good at reading other people's feelings and acting accordingly.
699,12,1,30,ESFP,39,"<no>  I'm not the type to plan things to do every day. I like to improvise, and when I do, the results are better."
700,12,1,30,ESFP,40,<Yes>  don't think I feel insecure compared to other people even in the same situation. It seems to be an innate tendency.
701,12,1,30,ESFP,41,"<Yes>  I don't like talking on the phone very much. I think I usually only talk on the phone when I have something really urgent. If possible, talk via KakaoTalk."
702,12,1,30,ESFP,42,<no>  I think I'll just understand and move on if it's a very different opinion from mine. I don't think I'm the type to take the time to understand that.
703,12,1,30,ESFP,43,"<neutrality>  I like meeting friends, but usually I'm not the type to actively ask to meet them first."
704,12,1,30,ESFP,44,"<Yes>  When there is a setback in my plan, I tend to quickly get out of the situation and try to resolve it. I recently went on a trip to Jeju Island, and I noticed in the hotel lobby that the hotel reservation was wrong. I immediately talked to the hotel staff to resolve the situation, so I was able to stay at the hotel."
705,12,1,30,ESFP,45,"<no>  I make mistakes and try to forget them quickly, and that's what happens. Especially if it's a mistake from a long time ago, it's rarely remembered."
706,12,1,30,ESFP,46,<Yes>  I don't think I've ever thought about human existence and the reason for living. I'm not really interested in such primal issues.
707,12,1,30,ESFP,47,<no> I'm not the type to get emotional. I'm on the side of controlling other people's emotions. People around me have said that a few times.
708,12,1,30,ESFP,48,"<no>  I don't think the face of the other person matters much when the fault is obvious. Because if you do something wrong, you should be held accountable."
721,13,1,40,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality>  It depends, but I don't necessarily try to make new friends on a regular basis. Because you don't feel the need."
722,13,1,40,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  Dedicated to exploring your interests. These days, I am particularly interested in travel, so I am perusing blogs and other things."
723,13,1,40,ESTJ,3,"<neutrality>  I don't think I'm particularly agitated by other people's feelings. I'm curious about the reason for crying, but I don't dare to ask unless it's a situation where I have to ask."
724,13,1,40,ESTJ,4,<Yes>  always make preparations. Because I don't like to rush and I want to get things done right and as planned.
725,13,1,40,ESTJ,5,"<neutrality>  I try to keep my composure as much as possible. There was a case where the summer camp was held at the cathedral, but it did not go as planned and was suddenly modified on the same day."
726,13,1,40,ESTJ,6,"<no>  It's not hard to say hello to new people first, and I try to say hello. In particular, I think it is an important part of social life."
727,13,1,40,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  Barring unavoidable circumstances, I try my best to complete one and start another. This is because you can focus as efficiently as possible."
728,13,1,40,ESTJ,8,"<no>  I don't think it's very emotional because I feel the least emotional when I watch a drama or movie with my friends, and when I see a pretty flower, I think it's a waste if it withers and throws away rather than how pretty it is."
729,13,1,40,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  When I do something, I always start with a plan. I try to do everything according to plan as much as possible, and I tend to check in between."
730,13,1,40,ESTJ,10,"<Yes>  If I made a mistake even though I could have done enough, I always check what went wrong and reflect on it. These days, as I get older, I often forget it, so I forgot the trivial chores to remember, which caused inconvenience to the drinking water."
731,13,1,40,ESTJ,11,"<no>  It's not hard, it's easy. You can approach new employees at the company first, talk to them, and make them feel comfortable."
732,13,1,40,ESTJ,12,"<neutrality>  I have no objection to the discussion itself, but I am not very interested in discussing various interpretations of artwork."
733,13,1,40,ESTJ,13,"<Yes> When I thought about it, it seemed that I was on the side of reason. Judging from the reviews of my colleagues at the company, I think the evaluations around me are similar, given that I distinguish well between public and private."
734,13,1,40,ESTJ,14,<no>  Make a plan for the day and move according to the plan as much as possible. It has been ingrained in my body ever since I was in school.
735,13,1,40,ESTJ,15,"<neutrality>  am conscious of others' eyes to some extent, but I don't worry about others' eyes, or I can't do anything because I'm afraid. I regretted not being able to do what I wanted to do because of the eyes of others during the college entrance exam."
736,13,1,40,ESTJ,16,"<neutrality>  I used to enjoy the energy I received from group activities, but I can't seem to enjoy it due to a little physical pressure due to menopause these days."
737,13,1,40,ESTJ,17,"<no>  I prefer books that focus on information delivery. These days, I read [The Analects to Read at Fifty]."
738,13,1,40,ESTJ,18,"<no>  I tend to focus more on what I do for myself rather than the success of others, and I tend to be more satisfied. It's because I have a heart to help others when I'm satisfied."
739,13,1,40,ESTJ,19,"<neutrality>  have so many interests that sometimes I don't know what to do next, but I prioritize and do only what I can in the time allotted to me. These days, I have many interests such as travel and obtaining certifications, but time is not allowed."
740,13,1,40,ESTJ,20,"<neutrality>  worry about things going wrong, but not often. I don't worry at all about things that are thoroughly prepared, and I tend to worry about things that aren't as well prepared as planned. There doesn't seem to be any particular occasion or reason."
741,13,1,40,ESTJ,21,"<neutrality>  I don't want to take on the role of a leader in a group, but I want to step up because I'm frustrated when the person playing the role of a leader doesn't do my job."
742,13,1,40,ESTJ,22,"<no>  It's not emotional, but the musical part is developed, so it can't be said that there is little artistic inclination."
743,13,1,40,ESTJ,23,<no>  I believe that the world will be a better place when reason and emotion are in proper harmony. I think harmony is more important than being biased towards anything.
744,13,1,40,ESTJ,24,"<Yes>  You should finish your chores before going to bed. You feel comfortable when things are in their place, so you can relax."
745,13,1,40,ESTJ,25,<neutrality>  neither enjoy nor avoid arguing. Because the tired situations that happen in an argument are not pleasant.
746,13,1,40,ESTJ,26,"<neutrality>  I tend not to try to get attention or not to attract attention. It's because when I get attention, I can confidently enjoy the situation as much as it attracts attention, and I don't avoid the situation to avoid attracting attention."
747,13,1,40,ESTJ,27,"<Yes>  Emotions seem to change quickly. Even if there is something angry, if there is something to laugh at, it's because I quickly forget it."
748,13,1,40,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  I am very annoyed. I think it's pitiful to see inefficient people who blindly start from the middle without a plan, or who can't finish because they can't allocate time."
749,13,1,40,ESTJ,29,<no>  What needs to be done must be done within the time required. This is the part that is kept unchanged even in the juice.
750,13,1,40,ESTJ,30,"<no>  I am not interested in questions about the afterlife. There are many things we do not know even in the world we live in now, because we cannot afford to be interested in the afterlife. And it is because there are doubts about whether there really is an afterlife."
751,13,1,40,ESTJ,31,"<neutrality>  In the past, spending time with people was much more enjoyable, but these days, due to menopause, I enjoy spending time alone due to a slight physical burden."
752,13,1,40,ESTJ,32,"<neutrality>  I am not very interested in the discussion itself, but I can participate in theory-oriented discussions. I was able to participate in discussions related to history to the extent that it was not boring."
753,13,1,40,ESTJ,33,"<Yes>  It's easy to relate to. After joining the company, everyone had different motives such as background and major, and knowing the difference helped a lot in working."
754,13,1,40,ESTJ,34,"<no> When the moment comes to make a decision, you make it. Rarely is it delayed until the end."
755,13,1,40,ESTJ,35,"<no>  I tend not to reconsider decisions I have already made. It's because you've already thought it through before making a decision, and it affects what you need to do next."
756,13,1,40,ESTJ,36,"<neutrality>  In the past, I used to relieve my fatigue with fun parties and events, but these days I tend to relax with my own time."
757,13,1,40,ESTJ,37,"<neutrality>  don't enjoy it, but I enjoy going to a concert once or twice a year."
758,13,1,40,ESTJ,38,"<neutrality>  It's not hard to understand other people's feelings, but I often think, 'If it were me, I wouldn't do that...'."
759,13,1,40,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos and do it like a habit. We plan everything, both public and private."
760,13,1,40,ESTJ,40,"<Yes>  I don't feel particularly anxious. I don't feel particularly insecure, it seems, because of my innate tendency."
761,13,1,40,ESTJ,41,<no>  Making phone calls is not difficult. Because it is a very basic necessity in life.
762,13,1,40,ESTJ,42,"<neutrality>  I don't spend much time understanding opinions that are very different from mine. I try to understand only to a certain extent, and for the sake of my mental health, if I still don't understand, I stop at that line."
763,13,1,40,ESTJ,43,"<Yes> Generally, I tend to arrange meetings. I tend to contact them first to set up a time and place."
764,13,1,40,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  If the plan is disrupted, we try to get back to it as quickly as possible. Only then can the rest of the plan be put into practice."
765,13,1,40,ESTJ,45,<Yes>  I regret my old mistakes. I regret that I should have tried to do what I wanted to do when I was in Daedae University.
766,13,1,40,ESTJ,46,"<neutrality>  I don't particularly think deeply about human existence and why we live. It is because I had concerns about the methodology of life, but I had no experience thinking about existence itself and the reason for living."
767,13,1,40,ESTJ,47,"<no>  I tend not to. Sometimes, I tend to ignore my emotions to the point of burying them. People around me also evaluate me that way."
768,13,1,40,ESTJ,48,"<Yes> Depending on the time and place, you need to make an effort to save the other person's face even if you know that it is their fault. It's because it's not a relationship."
781,14,0,30,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation, but I tend to make friends when necessary for a smooth social life."
782,14,0,30,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  Recently, I have been interested in stocks, so I am accessing stock-related information through books and various Internet."
783,14,0,30,ESTJ,3,"<no>  When someone else is crying, I want to go and comfort them rather than cry myself."
784,14,0,30,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  There is a habit of preparing for the worst and preparing in advance. It was because I was preparing for a big project during my company life in the past, but there was a problem with a part I hadn't thought of."
785,14,0,30,ESTJ,5,"<Yes>  When I was preparing for a job, I simulated pressure interviews in various situations, and after that, I was able to maintain my composure to some extent even when the pressure was severe."
786,14,0,30,ESTJ,6,"<no>  In the case of an event, it is a place where many other people gather, so I see it as an important place to make new friends and I tend to talk first."
787,14,0,30,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  In the case of carrying out more than two projects, each project has a slightly different tendency, so the results are not as expected. So, I tend to finish one project and work on another."
788,14,0,30,ESTJ,8,<no>  I think it's more rational than sentimental. I think I am on the rational side in order to understand the essence of things and grasp the providence.
789,14,0,30,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  Every year in December, we devise a plan for the coming year. I tend to set goals for the next year on my smartphone notepad, such as licenses, books, and savings."
790,14,0,30,ESTJ,10,"<neutrality> Recently, I bought things I needed at the mart, but I accidentally forgot the dog treats and couldn't buy them, but I didn't doubt my ability."
791,14,0,30,ESTJ,11,"<Yes>  I think the easiest way to talk with the other person is to not burden them. When we first meet, we tend to lead the conversation around common denominators such as weather and travel."
792,14,0,30,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  There is no one around who is engaged in art. From time to time, I tend to listen to only stories related to works of art through YouTube."
793,14,0,30,ESTJ,13,<Yes>  It has a positive disposition. My wife often talks about asking for sympathy rather than trying to solve the problem.
794,14,0,30,ESTJ,14,"<neutrality>  In the case of work, I plan and execute a schedule for the day, whereas on a day off, I tend to improvise unless there is a big deal."
795,14,0,30,ESTJ,15,"<Yes> Rather than looking at others, I tend to push ahead if my thoughts are right. It's because you can't express yourself when you adapt to the other person."
796,14,0,30,ESTJ,16,"<no>  Due to my personality, I tend to enjoy group activities, but these days it is difficult to participate in group activities because of childcare."
797,14,0,30,ESTJ,17,"<no>  When I see a piece of art, I tend not to put my own thoughts in order to feel the thoughts and emotions that went into the work of that artist."
798,14,0,30,ESTJ,18,<Yes>  feel a great sense of accomplishment in helping others. It's easy and rewarding to share tips and tricks with others.
799,14,0,30,ESTJ,19,"<no>  When you have an interest, you tend to be immersed in one thing. Recently, I am studying US stock futures trading."
800,14,0,30,ESTJ,20,<no>  I don't worry too much because I think of the next best thing and prioritize it accordingly.
801,14,0,30,ESTJ,21,"<Yes>  want to avoid the leadership role unless there is a specific reason. If it is unavoidable, I will be the leader, but I don't want to be the tired captain."
802,14,0,30,ESTJ,22,"<Yes>  I met a friend who did a flower list before, but I couldn't feel the aesthetic sense such as color matching or flower shape combination."
803,14,0,30,ESTJ,23,"<neutrality>  It could have been a better world, but if it had become a world that valued reason, it would have been a more brutal world."
804,14,0,30,ESTJ,24,"<Yes>  From then on, I have the idea of resting when I finish all my work, and I think this is my inclination rather than any kind of feeling."
805,14,0,30,ESTJ,25,"<Yes>  It is interesting to look at each person's position and thoughts and infer the result, and other people's arguments about controversial issues are interesting."
806,14,0,30,ESTJ,26,"<Yes>  I tend to be indifferent to the eyes of others, but I don't want to be a public servant."
807,14,0,30,ESTJ,27,"<neutrality>  He doesn't have a lot of emotional changes, but sometimes his hot-tempered side comes out when he gets into an argument."
808,14,0,30,ESTJ,28,"<neutrality>  Sometimes when I drive, I get annoyed when I see a car that seems to be able to go this far but can't and stalls."
809,14,0,30,ESTJ,29,"<Yes>  Recently, because of parenting, there are many times when washing dishes or laundry is postponed until the child is sleeping."
810,14,0,30,ESTJ,30,"<no> I've been thinking about the afterlife, but I'm not interested in it because I don't believe in it."
811,14,0,30,ESTJ,31,"<neutrality>  The advantages of being alone and the advantages of being with others are different, so it doesn't matter if you are alone or two."
812,14,0,30,ESTJ,32,"<no>  I often enjoy 100-minute discussions, but I don't think it's boring when I see politicians who think that only facts based on facts are the truth and stick to a more principled position."
813,14,0,30,ESTJ,33,"<Yes> Among my foreign friends, I have a friend who was naturalized after living in California, USA, and I could easily sympathize with him even though he clearly has a different mindset."
814,14,0,30,ESTJ,34,"<Yes>  In the case of an important decision, you have to think about various variables, so you do not make a decision in a hurry, but make a final decision by considering as many situations as possible."
815,14,0,30,ESTJ,35,"<neutrality>  Most of the time, they don't give up, but they change their decision when they think something is superior to their last decision."
816,14,0,30,ESTJ,36,<Yes>  enjoy meeting many different people. It's a pity that I haven't been able to meet you a lot lately because of Corona.
817,14,0,30,ESTJ,37,"<no>  I'm not interested in art, and even when I look at the picture, I'm not familiar with art, so I just think that this kind of painting is good."
818,14,0,30,ESTJ,38,"<no>  When there is an argument or argument, I tend to listen to the other person's point of view, so it's easy to understand the other person's feelings or words."
819,14,0,30,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  I hate working overtime, so I tend to plan my work to be as efficient as possible within the given time."
820,14,0,30,ESTJ,40,"<neutrality>  People in their teens and twenties had anxiety about the future, but they are the type to set high standards and act according to those standards."
821,14,0,30,ESTJ,41,"<no>  Texting takes longer than a phone call, and out of context can lead to misunderstandings, so it's easier to call than text."
822,14,0,30,ESTJ,42,"<no> When opinions conflict, I tend to listen to the other person's opinions a lot, so I don't spend a lot of time understanding them."
823,14,0,30,ESTJ,43,"<no>  I often call my friends to say hello, but after getting married, my family becomes my priority, so I don't call my friends to meet first."
824,14,0,30,ESTJ,44,"<neutrality>  It depends on what kind of plan you have. In the case of company projects, I meet the schedule as soon as possible, but in the case of personal work, I do it again when I have free time."
825,14,0,30,ESTJ,45,<no>  don't regret it even if there are times when I remind myself not to make mistakes again.
826,14,0,30,ESTJ,46,"<no>  When you read a space-related article like James Webb, you question the origin of the universe itself, not humans."
827,14,0,30,ESTJ,47,"<no>  I think reality is a real battle, so I control my emotions and always make cool judgments, so I don't think I'm swayed by emotions."
828,14,0,30,ESTJ,48,"<Yes> If the other person is judged to be a boss or an elder, they also have pride, so they save face for a smooth social life."
841,15,1,40,ESTP,1,<Yes>  I periodically make new people friends. The reason is that meeting new people is exciting and fun.
842,15,1,40,ESTP,2,"<Yes>  I am interested in youth soccer. For that reason, I search a lot of youth soccer YouTube these days."
843,15,1,40,ESTP,3,"<neutrality>  cry when I understand the situation, but sometimes I wonder why I cry when I don't empathize."
844,15,1,40,ESTP,4,<neutrality>  I don't make preparations every time. The reason is that you don't necessarily think things are going according to the preparedness or plan.
845,15,1,40,ESTP,5,"<Yes>  Even in difficult situations, I seem to maintain a calm mind on the outside. Even when other people curse at each other and fight, I don't get excited and talk quietly."
846,15,1,40,ESTP,6,"<no>  Even when I meet new people, I enjoy talking and getting to know myself. The reason is because even a new person has something to learn."
847,15,1,40,ESTP,7,"<neutrality>  can do multiple things at once. That's why if you only have one project, you'll be crazy about it, but together you can do several things at once. Even when doing housework, I do several things together rather than one by one."
848,15,1,40,ESTP,8,<neutrality>  I'm not very sentimental. The reason is that sometimes reality matters.
849,15,1,40,ESTP,9,"<no>  I don't like making plans. The reason is that no matter how you plan, there are always contingencies."
850,15,1,40,ESTP,10,<no>  I have no doubts. The reason is that everyone thinks that everyone has their own field they are good at.
851,15,1,40,ESTP,11,"<no>  I approach first and talk. If you approach me kindly, the other person knows your heart and treats you kindly, so there was no big difficulty."
852,15,1,40,ESTP,12,"<neutrality> Sometimes I have fun, but most of the time I don't really care. The reason is that other people's opinions don't matter too much because each person's interpretation will be different."
853,15,1,40,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. If you recognize that it is wrong, you will not do it well even if you want to do it."
854,15,1,40,ESTP,14,<Yes>  I like to improvise what I want to do. This is because impromptu travel is more satisfying when you go on a trip.
855,15,1,40,ESTP,15,"<Yes>  I tend to be conscious of other people's eyes. I don't have a reason or reason for thinking like that, but I don't think there's anything good about being seen badly by others because you don't live alone in the world."
856,15,1,40,ESTP,16,"<neutrality>  I'm not a big fan of group activities. These days, there is a soccer mothers' meeting, but sometimes it's fun and sometimes it's hard for people, so I don't participate every time."
857,15,1,40,ESTP,17,"<no>  It's good to have a clean ending. It's not interesting to think on my own, but rather disgusting. I haven't read books or movies lately."
858,15,1,40,ESTP,18,"<neutrality>  I don't feel any greater satisfaction. The reason is that after my success, there must be other people's success. If only others succeed, there is only envy."
859,15,1,40,ESTP,19,"<Yes>  I am interested in several things. I am interested in youth football, financial technology, and other interests, so it is a bit difficult to allocate time."
860,15,1,40,ESTP,20,"<Yes>  I worry a lot. There will be unexpected situations with anything, so if there is nothing precise, I often worry."
861,15,1,40,ESTP,21,"<Yes>  want to avoid leaders. The reason is because I don't have the responsibility and diligence as a leader, so I don't think it's right for me."
862,15,1,40,ESTP,22,"<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. The reason is that sometimes I think that if I play the guitar nicely in front of others, I want to sing."
863,15,1,40,ESTP,23,"<no>  I think emotions are important too. This is because if there was reason, the society would have become a little hard and ruthless."
864,15,1,40,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I like to finish my chores before the break. I'm not doing well, but I used to feel more comfortable when I was relaxing in a clean house."
865,15,1,40,ESTP,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy seeing other people's arguments. The reason is because when you listen to an argument, you know what people think."
866,15,1,40,ESTP,26,"<Yes>  try not to draw attention. The reason is that when you belong to a group, it is easier to follow the lead rather than stand out."
867,15,1,40,ESTP,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change quickly. If you feel good because your son tells you a pleasant story in the morning, there are many things that have continued throughout the day."
868,15,1,40,ESTP,28,"<no>  I'm not interested if the other person isn't efficient. The reason is that there are not only people like me, but because each person is different."
869,15,1,40,ESTP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. The reason is that I have to go on a trip recently, but the decision to go or not is also decided on the day of the trip."
870,15,1,40,ESTP,30,<no>  I have no interest in the afterlife. The reason is because I don't think there is an afterlife.
871,15,1,40,ESTP,31,"<neutrality> There are times when I want to be alone and there are times when I miss people when I am alone. These days, when I'm alone and work, I'm a little lonely, but I'm doing my best for my children."
872,15,1,40,ESTP,32,<Yes>  I am not interested in theory-oriented discussions. The reason is that I think experience is more important than theory.
873,15,1,40,ESTP,33,"<Yes>  can easily relate to people from backgrounds. No matter what your situation is, no matter how rich you are, there will be people who feel that you are not happy, and it is because you think that there is no difference just because your background is different."
874,15,1,40,ESTP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone decisions until the end. The reason is that when something happens, I want it to be a choice without regret after thinking it through to the end almost every time, not once or twice."
875,15,1,40,ESTP,35,"<no> Even after making a decision, I continue to think about it. The reason is that even if you've made a decision, you think you can change it at any time until things are put into action."
876,15,1,40,ESTP,36,"<Yes>  I don't get tired every time with a fun party or event, but I get energy from an event or party. These days, when people ask to meet, I try to get out."
877,15,1,40,ESTP,37,"<no>  am not interested in going to art galleries. However, when the opportunity arises, I try to find out what the work means and try to think of something."
878,15,1,40,ESTP,38,"<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. As a parent who teaches soccer, I can understand even if other parents say things that do not fit with me."
879,15,1,40,ESTP,39,"<no>  I'm bad at planning. I like to improvise rather than plan, and I think the satisfaction I feel there is high."
880,15,1,40,ESTP,40,<Yes>  I rarely feel insecure. It seems to be an innate tendency. I think I tend to think a lot of positive things.
881,15,1,40,ESTP,41,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that it is fun to talk on the phone with close people, but I think it is unnecessary to talk on the phone with people I am not close to."
882,15,1,40,ESTP,42,"<no> I'm not trying to understand other opinions. There are many such experiences, but I try to pass them off thinking that it could be just that every time."
883,15,1,40,ESTP,43,"<no>  I don't contact you to meet first. The reason is that there are times when I am lonely when I am alone, but there are many times when I am busy."
884,15,1,40,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  Even if things go wrong, I try to get back to my plans as soon as possible. I remember going on a trip and there was a problem with accommodation, but I had to sleep with my children, so I had to fix it in a hurry."
885,15,1,40,ESTP,45,"<Yes>  I tend to regret mistakes made a long time ago. These days, I'm regretting not being close to people I've become close to."
886,15,1,40,ESTP,46,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living, but that doesn't mean I don't think about it at all. The reason is that even if you think about it, only endless questions remain."
887,15,1,40,ESTP,47,"<no>  I am good at controlling my emotions. No matter how angry you are, if you like to talk softly without being very angry, people around you will also say that you are a good person."
888,15,1,40,ESTP,48,"<Yes>  Even if the other person makes a mistake, I pretend not to know or try to cover it up. The reason is because I think that anyone can make mistakes, and even those who made mistakes can understand everything without me having to tell them."
901,16,0,40,ENTP,1,"<Yes>  We do not intend to make new friends, but we do periodically. When I meet new friends, I get curious and excited, and I feel good, so I naturally make new friends and make them."
902,16,0,40,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  I am interested in new things rather than old ones. So these days, I'm mainly looking for outdoor activities such as fishing and camping."
903,16,0,40,ENTP,3,"<neutrality> First of all, I'm curious about the reason for crying, and sometimes I cry when I can relate to that reason."
904,16,0,40,ENTP,4,"<neutrality>  I hypothesize what could go wrong and think about it, but I don't even prepare for it. I think it is more important to find out and execute so that things can go well during the time to make preparations."
905,16,0,40,ENTP,5,"<Yes>  I hate seeing myself shaken. I hate it even more when things go wrong due to pressure, so I try to solve things by maintaining my composure as much as possible."
906,16,0,40,ENTP,6,<neutrality>  I don't mind introducing myself first. Just chat comfortably with the people around you.
907,16,0,40,ENTP,7,"<Yes>  I like to finish quickly what I start and do other things. When things get delayed, I tend to lose interest and not pay attention to them, so I tend to finish things up as quickly as possible."
908,16,0,40,ENTP,8,<no>  think rationally rather than sentimentally. I objectively and rationally judge and analyze various situations and actions.
909,16,0,40,ENTP,9,"<no>  I don't plan well for work or travel. I know some important events or trips, but I don't usually plan and execute them clearly."
910,16,0,40,ENTP,10,"<Yes>  I hate repeating the same mistakes. So, if I come across a mistake or misunderstood knowledge, I try to find it quickly and correct it."
911,16,0,40,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  It's not that hard to have a conversation with someone. In particular, I want to talk more because I want to know who I am interested in. Usually, starting with a light everyday conversation, I was able to have a pleasant conversation by mixing a simple humor."
912,16,0,40,ENTP,12,"<neutrality>  am not very interested in the art itself. However, I enjoy seeing and hearing diversity, discussing and discussing various interpretations or understandings of the same object or situation."
913,16,0,40,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  We act with rational judgment as our top priority. I think that is the most reasonable decision to solve a problem or work. Especially when there is a difficult job, I hear a lot of voices."
914,16,0,40,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  think the fixed schedule is not fun and boring. I can't just improvise what I want to do every moment, but there are cases where I go blindly when I see a good travel destination or restaurant while watching TV or on my smartphone."
915,16,0,40,ENTP,15,"<Yes>  It doesn't matter how others evaluate me. Because each person has a different set of values, I think the criteria for judging me will be different and the evaluation will be different. Rather than that, I think the evaluation or satisfaction of myself is more important."
916,16,0,40,ENTP,16,"<Yes>  enjoy meeting or traveling with many people. These days, I can't do well because of Corona."
917,16,0,40,ENTP,17,"<Yes>  I like movies with open endings. It's nice to be able to reason about the ending and discuss this with a lot of people. I don't have any recent memories, but I like the movie Shutter Island the most."
918,16,0,40,ENTP,18,"<no>  I don't feel satisfied at all. I am not very interested in the success of others, and my own success or happiness is more important."
919,16,0,40,ENTP,19,"<neutrality>  I have a curiosity about the part that I didn't know well. Rather than thinking about what to do next, I focus on the task in front of me."
920,16,0,40,ENTP,20,<no>  I don't worry about things that haven't happened yet. I think it's important to work to prevent that from happening.
921,16,0,40,ENTP,21,"<neutrality>  I don't step out. However, I don't care too much when I'm in charge of the situation."
922,16,0,40,ENTP,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. I am not at all interested in artistic things, and even when I see works of art, I am not very inspired."
923,16,0,40,ENTP,23,"<neutrality> Fundamentally, if I put more emphasis on rationality, I think I've made a lot of progress. But I don't think an improved world is a better world. Although the world has developed to become a better world, such as wars, viruses, and the gap between rich and poor, it seems to create other problems."
924,16,0,40,ENTP,24,<no>  I think it's good to take a break and finish the housework. I think it's better to do housework quickly after taking a break than doing housework in a stressful state.
925,16,0,40,ENTP,25,<Yes> It's fun to see and debate. The process of learning and listening to other people thinking and speaking according to their own values is fun.
926,16,0,40,ENTP,26,"<neutrality>  I don't care too much about other people's attention or nerves. When I do something or act, my goal is important and I don't even care about other people."
927,16,0,40,ENTP,27,<no>  I refrain from drastic changes in my emotions because I hate myself for ruining my work or not being able to control myself.
928,16,0,40,ENTP,28,"<neutrality>  I care about people close to me, but I don't care much about people who aren't. I gave advice to a friend who only listens to what others say and thinks it is easy to prepare for a start-up."
929,16,0,40,ENTP,29,"<neutrality>  I don't particularly put it off until the end. When I think of it, I do it right then and somehow solve it before the end."
930,16,0,40,ENTP,30,<no> I'm not very interested. There is nothing scientifically confirmed and I don't think it means much.
931,16,0,40,ENTP,31,"<Yes>  I like to meet people. I haven't met many people yet because of the corona, but I'm increasing it little by little."
932,16,0,40,ENTP,32,"<no>  like the discussion itself. I think it's interesting because each person understands and thinks differently, even if it's a principled story. For example, politicians say that we should strive for national development, but the process and direction are different depending on our inclinations."
933,16,0,40,ENTP,33,"<no>  can say that I sympathize with you and understand you, but I don't think I can empathize with you exactly. I try to understand it from indirect experience or from the perspective of another person, but I think it is to a certain extent, and even in the same situation, people have different thoughts, but I think it will be more difficult to sympathize with people from completely different backgrounds."
934,16,0,40,ENTP,34,"<neutrality>  Rather than procrastinating, I tend to research and choose as much as possible so that I can make the best decision."
935,16,0,40,ENTP,35,"<Yes>  Once a decision is made, I think it is important to work hard to make sure that the decision works well rather than doubting the decision."
936,16,0,40,ENTP,36,"<Yes>  Meeting people, drinking and having fun relieves stress. So far, it's hard to meet people often due to corona."
937,16,0,40,ENTP,37,"<no>  I've never been to an art gallery, and I have no interest in, or even thinking about, appreciating art."
938,16,0,40,ENTP,38,"<Yes> Humans sometimes make mistakes while working. At that time, I need to fix the mistake quickly, but I can't understand it when I see him struggling with losing his mind."
939,16,0,40,ENTP,39,"<neutrality>  When it comes to work, I think it is necessary to have a plan, such as a minimum schedule. Personally, I think you have to plan more and more as you get married."
940,16,0,40,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  think you feel insecure when you don't believe in yourself. There are innate tendencies, but I think it¡¯s because I made myself stronger through self-reflection and self-reflection."
941,16,0,40,ENTP,41,"<neutrality>  I don't particularly avoid it. However, I prefer to have a face-to-face conversation rather than a phone call."
942,16,0,40,ENTP,42,"<neutrality>  I'm not trying to force you to understand. But if someone makes me understand logically, I agree and understand."
943,16,0,40,ENTP,43,<neutrality>  don't care about who asked to meet first. I don't think that matters.
944,16,0,40,ENTP,44,"<Yes>  If there is a variable in the plan, I think we need to quickly judge and resolve it. I was going to go boat fishing, but a typhoon came and I quickly made a reservation for another day."
945,16,0,40,ENTP,45,"<no>  I do not regret or regret past mistakes. Instead of regretting it, I reflect on that time and try not to make the same mistake."
946,16,0,40,ENTP,46,"<neutrality> Rather than thinking like that, I think it's more important to think for the current happiness and situation."
947,16,0,40,ENTP,47,"<no>  When I'm having a hard time, I tend to control my emotions as much as possible and think rationally. People around me seem to think that way too, but I don't really pay much attention to it, so I'm not sure."
948,16,0,40,ENTP,48,"<no>  When you make a mistake, I think it's better to tell people not to repeat the same mistake than to save face."
961,17,0,30,ESTP,1,<Yes>  like getting to know people I don't know for the first time in new places.
962,17,0,30,ESTP,2,<Yes>  I like to find new features among electronic products such as computers.
963,17,0,30,ESTP,3,"<no>  Rather than crying with the grieving person, give appropriate solutions to help."
964,17,0,30,ESTP,4,"<Yes>  In order to reduce the damage received when something goes wrong, always be prepared and seek a solution."
965,17,0,30,ESTP,5,"<no>  In high-pressure situations, such as job interviews, speech and action slow down due to tension."
966,17,0,30,ESTP,6,"<Yes>  I like meeting new people, but I'm comfortable talking to familiar people."
967,17,0,30,ESTP,7,<no>  Maximize efficiency by doing a variety of other tasks that can be done simultaneously.
968,17,0,30,ESTP,8,"<no>  Mainly, I try to reduce the consumption of complex emotions that cause headaches as much as possible."
969,17,0,30,ESTP,9,"<Yes>  Scheduling is okay, but I basically plan my list with my phone calendar or notepad."
970,17,0,30,ESTP,10,"<no>  I think I can always make mistakes, and I drive every day, but I try not to make mistakes."
971,17,0,30,ESTP,11,<Yes>  Appealing to most interested people is more difficult than normal conversation.
972,17,0,30,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  For an accurate understanding of the work, I prefer works with detailed commentary."
973,17,0,30,ESTP,13,<Yes>  I tend to make judgments based on reason because I often make mistakes when I work emotionally.
974,17,0,30,ESTP,14,"<no>  If I improvise, the part I can enjoy may be reduced."
975,17,0,30,ESTP,15,<Yes>  Reputation doesn't matter because I think people's attitudes will change if I try.
976,17,0,30,ESTP,16,"<Yes>  I like group activities, but it is difficult to attend the meetings I had before after marriage."
977,17,0,30,ESTP,17,<no>  It's good because a novel with an accurate ending makes you feel like you've finished a book.
978,17,0,30,ESTP,18,<no>  prioritize my own success because I can help others only if I succeed first.
979,17,0,30,ESTP,19,<no>  I tend to focus on one thing without going through multiple interests.
980,17,0,30,ESTP,20,<no>  Plan ahead so you don't make mistakes because you don't think worrying will solve your problems.
981,17,0,30,ESTP,21,"<no>  Because he has a career as a military officer, he is able to play the role of a leader, so he does not avoid it."
982,17,0,30,ESTP,22,<Yes> It's hard to start when you do painting or creative work as an assignment in school.
983,17,0,30,ESTP,23,<no>  I think it's good to prioritize emotions because I think it's humane to act emotionally between people.
984,17,0,30,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  For the feeling of finishing, I prefer to rest after a certain amount of work has been completed."
985,17,0,30,ESTP,25,<Yes>  I think you can learn about things you don't know by arguing with others.
986,17,0,30,ESTP,26,<no>  like to focus on myself because attention is focused on the part I am good at.
987,17,0,30,ESTP,27,<no>  Be careful with your words and actions so that there are no mistakes caused by sudden changes in emotions.
988,17,0,30,ESTP,28,<Yes>  It's frustrating to see employees or friends who can't use their time efficiently while working.
989,17,0,30,ESTP,29,<no>  It is easier to carry out the next task without being delayed when the planned task is executed immediately.
990,17,0,30,ESTP,30,<Yes>  like having logical conversations because I want to reduce my worries about the afterlife.
991,17,0,30,ESTP,31,<no>  I prefer gatherings because I need to be with energetic people to recover my energy.
992,17,0,30,ESTP,32,<no>  I think there is something to be learned by sharing opinions from various perspectives through discussions with others.
993,17,0,30,ESTP,33,<Yes>  They want to know about the various difficulties of their own life that others have gone through.
994,17,0,30,ESTP,34,"<no> When it comes to pre-planned work, I like to make immediate decisions."
995,17,0,30,ESTP,35,"<no>  If there are mistakes or there is something to be supplemented, I think it can be fully reviewed."
996,17,0,30,ESTP,36,<Yes>  I think it's better to have fun with different people than to spend time alone.
997,17,0,30,ESTP,37,<Yes>  Not thinking deeply through art appreciation is good for relieving stress at work.
998,17,0,30,ESTP,38,<Yes> There are times when people who can't look at reality and talk about distant things are sometimes frustrating.
999,17,0,30,ESTP,39,"<Yes>  Before going to work, make a detailed plan for today's work in your head."
1000,17,0,30,ESTP,40,"<no>  I always feel anxiety about the future, but I try to solve it well without any other problems."
1001,17,0,30,ESTP,41,<no>  I don't feel any difficulty in talking on the phone with strangers while at work.
1002,17,0,30,ESTP,42,"<Yes>  Every day, I tend to discuss my perspective on the world with my wife through various incidents."
1003,17,0,30,ESTP,43,"<no>  Most of my friends contact me first, and when they contact me, I tend to respond unconditionally."
1004,17,0,30,ESTP,44,<Yes>  I have experience replanning to correct when the results of a new attempt are not good.
1005,17,0,30,ESTP,45,<Yes>  There was a case where I looked back and regretted the words or actions I said to my friend by mistake.
1006,17,0,30,ESTP,46,<no>  My life is still busy and hectic to find the reason for existence.
1007,17,0,30,ESTP,47,"<no>  He always tries to control his emotions and his expressions are blunt, so people around him say that he is like a robot."
1008,17,0,30,ESTP,48,"<Yes>  Even if it's a big mistake, depending on the situation, if there are people around me, I tend to try to understand."
1021,18,1,30,ENTJ,1,"<neutrality>  When I have to adapt to a new environment, I tend to make new friends there. If you don't really need friends, you won't make friends."
1022,18,1,30,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  I tend to devote most of my free time to my favorite interests. Currently, I am pregnant, so I am studying prenatal care, preparation of maternity products, and childcare for the baby to be born."
1023,18,1,30,ENTJ,3,"<no>  I wonder why I'm crying, what's wrong with me. But I don't want to cry along. I just wonder why."
1024,18,1,30,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  I think that the goal set in the beginning can be achieved without problems only when specific preparations are made, so I always prepare various countermeasures and proceed with the work."
1025,18,1,30,ENTJ,5,"<Yes>  try to keep my composure as much as possible because I can't complete the work I've been pushing for if I collapse under too much pressure. For example, I received a certificate of contents from a famous law firm in relation to intellectual property infringement on a franchise brand operated by a company I worked for before. At the time, I had just been appointed as the head of the franchise operation team, so I had no idea how my predecessors planned the branding and proceeded with the naming process. The fact that it was difficult to find data because the predecessors had left the company also added to the pressure. However, I used all the materials the company had to create refutation materials for the content proof, and eventually the situation was resolved without any problems. It was an experience that proved my belief that nothing can be accomplished in the end if you let go of the pressure."
1026,18,1,30,ENTJ,6,"<neutrality>  It depends. If this is a work-related event, I will first introduce myself to the key figures of business partners or executives with whom I must contact. But if it's an event designed for friendship, you'll greet people you already know and then explore new people. The reason is because I think you should set the order of dealing with people by distinguishing time and place."
1027,18,1,30,ENTJ,7,"<neutrality> It depends. Depending on the importance and quantity of the ongoing project, whether or not other projects will be carried out in parallel will vary. I tend to find and do what is necessary rather than proceeding with a given task, because if one task is not finished and I do not proceed with other tasks, there will inevitably be cases where it becomes twice or even triple the difficulty later. If there is something I can do, it is easier to find it in advance and finish it all."
1028,18,1,30,ENTJ,8,"<no> I'm not very sentimental. Rather than empathizing with other people's feelings, I analyze the situation that happened and find a way to solve the problem, so I prefer to analyze the situation according to my beliefs and thoughts rather than being swept away by other people's feelings."
1029,18,1,30,ENTJ,9,"<Yes> When I work, I always start with a plan. Most of the time, human work doesn't go as planned, but if you make a plan first and prepare, omissions or mistakes can be minimized. When planning a trip, be sure to first make a list of itineraries divided by date and time, and proceed with the trip after obtaining consent from the companions. My favorite tool is Excel."
1030,18,1,30,ENTJ,10,"<no> Everyone makes mistakes. I don't think you can do anything right if you doubt yourself because you made one small mistake. If you make a mistake, I think there will be no problem as long as you make up for it as quickly as possible and don't repeat the same mistake again."
1031,18,1,30,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  tend to easily understand people's tendencies. If there's someone you're interested in, take a moment to observe the person's facial expression, tone of voice, what they're doing and say, then figure out what they're interested in and start a conversation about it. I don't think I've ever found it difficult to start a conversation."
1032,18,1,30,ENTJ,12,"<Yes> People have their own logic and thoughts. In particular, art works are an area where the correct answer cannot be defined because there are so many different interpretations depending on individual inclinations. Since the subjective interpretation of a work of art is different depending on the inclination of each individual, I do not think that any correct answer can be established through discussion. So I am not very interested in discussing the interpretation of works of art."
1033,18,1,30,ENTJ,13,"<Yes>  think that if I don't look back on the situation in my emotions, I will ruin everything around me, so I tend to prioritize following reason. This is because you must always analyze the situation and rationally understand the situation so that you can deal with any problems or unexpected situations without wavering. People around me tend to evaluate me as being very rational."
1034,18,1,30,ENTJ,14,"<no>  prefer to make a specific plan and act according to it. I don't like to improvise, because doing so often wastes time without doing anything."
1035,18,1,30,ENTJ,15,"<neutrality>  guess I can't make everyone like me. However, I think that at least creating an image that is not uncomfortable with each other and acting accordingly is a necessary skill to experience minimal discomfort while living in society. It would be very comfortable and nice if you didn't care about how others see you and act as you like, but if you do, things will inevitably happen that you can't do what you want. So, I think it is necessary to adjust the image of myself reflected by others to some extent and deal with them."
1036,18,1,30,ENTJ,16,"<neutrality>  I tend to participate more actively than anyone else if this group activity is essential to my work. These days, I'm focusing on preparing supplies for my baby, and there are quite a few activities to participate in for this. I started social media activities that I would not have been interested in normally, and I am participating in various group activities related to babies."
1037,18,1,30,ENTJ,17,"<no>  I don't like art that has an ambiguous finish. It's because you feel uncomfortable after watching it if the giseungjeongyeol-I is not clear. No matter how much I interpret and create the ending in my head, the writer's intended content will be different, but I think it's a very irresponsible attitude to make the reader imagine the ending alone."
1038,18,1,30,ENTJ,18,"<no>  I see no use if I don't succeed. It's because helping others succeed doesn't make that success mine. In the end, if someone else succeeds, he succeeds, and no one will remember that I helped him succeed."
1039,18,1,30,ENTJ,19,"<no>  tend to plan and push ahead with almost everything I do, so it's rare that I don't know what to do next."
1040,18,1,30,ENTJ,20,"<Yes> No matter how perfectly I handle things, I think mistakes can happen in unexpected places because I am still a human being. So, I tend to check again and again until the work in progress is perfectly completed. If the work I am responsible for is wrong, all the mistakes and faults remain as my stigma, so I tend to worry and worry about them until the work is over."
1041,18,1,30,ENTJ,21,"<no> As a leader, it is easy for me to move things in the direction I want. That is why I have no hesitation in taking on a leadership role in a group. If I want to lead the work in the direction I want, I think taking on the role of the head, even if it is a bit annoying, is helpful for the progress of the work."
1042,18,1,30,ENTJ,22,"<no>  I have enjoyed writing novels and drawing since I was in school. In fact, I published a novel I wrote on the Internet and recorded more than 2,000 readers."
1043,18,1,30,ENTJ,23,"<Yes>  don't think it's okay to put emotions first. Of course, not many people can think rationally in every situation, but that doesn't mean that if you put your feelings first and act according to your feelings, the problem will only grow and not be solved. I think the world will be a little more reasonable if people understand the situation and respond to it rationally and with common sense rather than putting my emotions first."
1044,18,1,30,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  tend not to take breaks when I have work to do. The reason is that if housework is piled up, even if you take a break, you won't be able to rest, so even if you're a little tired and annoying, you can quickly finish the housework first and then take a break."
1045,18,1,30,ENTJ,25,"<neutrality> Interest varies depending on the topic of the debate. If it's not related to me, I won't be interested, but if this debate has anything to do with me, I think I'll look at it with interest. The reason is that it is a good opportunity to find out what other people think about things related to me. If you know what people think in advance, I think it will be a little easier when you push forward with your work."
1046,18,1,30,ENTJ,26,<Yes>  I don't think there's any need to step out and get other people's attention unless it's absolutely necessary. This is because too much attention often causes trouble.
1047,18,1,30,ENTJ,27,"<no>  I'm not usually very emotionally agitated. I react appropriately to the other person's actions, but in many cases my reactions are not tied to emotions."
1048,18,1,30,ENTJ,28,"<Yes>  get very annoyed when I see people who can't do their jobs efficiently. For example, the managing director of the previous company was a person who did not derive values using functions when using Excel, but wrote down numbers in Excel cells, calculated them with a calculator, and manually entered the values one by one. The executive director was the final approval intro of the expenditure resolution, but since he was manually calculating the amount of expenditure one by one, it was not once or twice that urgent expenditures occurred and even when he submitted the resolution, he was blocked at the approval stage and almost made a mistake. Because of this problem, I made him several times an excel sheet that automatically calculates the expenses, but in the end he didn't use his method, saying it was convenient. I felt a lot of annoyance when I saw my boss who couldn't work efficiently."
1049,18,1,30,ENTJ,29,"<no>  When I have something to do, I prefer to do it quickly. It's something you have to do in the end, but if you put it off, there's nothing good about it later."
1050,18,1,30,ENTJ,30,<Yes>  have a pretty big interest in the afterlife. There has always been a curiosity about the mysterious realm unknown to humans. I am interested not only in the afterlife but also in similar contexts such as the distant universe and the existence of extraterrestrials.
1051,18,1,30,ENTJ,31,"<neutrality>  I used to enjoy KakaoTalk and meetings with my close friends. However, these days, I prefer to spend time alone because I am in the late stages of pregnancy and it is inconvenient to go out because my body is heavy."
1052,18,1,30,ENTJ,32,<no>  I don't think there's anything bad about any topic. Because I think it helps me to know what other people think and to know about this person's tendencies.
1053,18,1,30,ENTJ,33,"<neutrality> There's no reason you can't empathize just because your background is different. Everyone has their own logic and thoughts, but I think it's okay if you can't sympathize with them just because they come from different backgrounds. However, no matter who sees it, if that person has gone astray to the extent that they cannot help but sympathize with them, they don't feel the need to sympathize with them, so they tend not to sympathize with them."
1054,18,1,30,ENTJ,34,"<no>  believe that a quick decision can be made with a quick decision. Of course, it will take time to consider and investigate the matter in various ways before making a decision, but even so, if you postpone the decision until the end, you can't do anything."
1055,18,1,30,ENTJ,35,"<no>  can't reverse the decision I've already made, but I always take the time to think about what it would be like if I had done it this way. The decision has already been made, but I don't think it's a bad thing to look back to see how it would have helped me had I gone in a different direction."
1056,18,1,30,ENTJ,36,"<no>  I am pregnant, so I am taking special care of myself. I am minimizing contact with others because I have heard that the corona virus is not completely over and that an infectious disease that can be fatal to babies continues to spread these days."
1057,18,1,30,ENTJ,37,<neutrality>  I don't think it's bad to build up my own knowledge while appreciating the work. But I don't have to go out and look for it. Because there are so many other things you can do with that time.
1058,18,1,30,ENTJ,38,"<neutrality>  tend to try to understand other people's feelings in most situations. However, I don't understand people who only show their feelings in ridiculous situations. For example, among my acquaintances, there is a person who has been preparing for a literary career for 10 years. Her husband is raising his living expenses alone, and he says he does most of the housework. However, this acquaintance says that he does not want to do housework, does not cook, and does not want to engage in economic activities because it is difficult because he cannot become a writer. But that doesn't mean this person writes all day and participates in every contest. I honestly don't understand this acquaintance, so I'm getting less and less contact."
1059,18,1,30,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  When I am working, I always write down a work journal first and proceed with the work according to this journal. Organizing your work log by date is a great help in remembering what you did and how you did it. If you have a problem later, you can look back at this record to help you troubleshoot it."
1060,18,1,30,ENTJ,40,"<neutrality>  I don't think that feeling anxious will solve the problem, so I try to keep my composure as much as possible. This is because they believe that it is easier to remove the factors that cause anxiety in a calm and rational state."
1061,18,1,30,ENTJ,41,"<no>  I don't see any reason to avoid talking on the phone. I don't think there's any need to avoid it unless there's a reason to avoid it. And when I work, I tend to prefer phone calls because communication through phone calls can be processed much faster than communication using texts such as text messages or e-mails."
1062,18,1,30,ENTJ,42,"<no>  I don't think you need to spend a lot of time to understand opinions that differ from mine. If his opinion differs from mine, I can proceed as he pursues, and I can proceed as I pursue."
1063,18,1,30,ENTJ,43,"<neutrality>  There are times when I propose to meet first, and there are times when friends contact me first. It's almost half and half, but these days, I'm going out because of Corona."
1064,18,1,30,ENTJ,44,"<neutrality>  If my plan goes wrong, I try to go back to the original plan as much as possible, and if that doesn't work, I tend to give up quickly. For example, if you decide to visit place B after leisure activity A at a travel destination, but activity A gets longer and you go to B later, if there is a situation where all the rest of the schedule goes wrong, boldly give up B and go directly to the schedule that suits the time. I used to"
1065,18,1,30,ENTJ,45,"<Yes>  I started a business when I was young, and it was a huge failure. And I often regret that I should not have done business. Because the financial loss from this failure was too great."
1066,18,1,30,ENTJ,46,"<Yes>  have never really thought deeply about why humans exist. After all, I exist in this place, at this time, and because I am living every moment to the best of my ability, there is no particular need to explore why humans exist."
1067,18,1,30,ENTJ,47,"<no>  I think that if you are swayed by emotions, things will not work out. It is because it helps to solve the problem by organizing the situation rationally rather than emotionally. People around me evaluate me as a rational person."
1068,18,1,30,ENTJ,48,"<Yes>  I believe that when you openly criticize someone for making a mistake, you lose the opportunity to use that person's abilities. I think it is an ideal attitude to recognize one's own mistakes, but point them out to the extent that they are not completely broken, and give the person another chance to make up for their mistakes."
1081,19,1,40,ISTJ,1,<no>  stick with existing friends more than making new ones because I believe one true friend is more important than many friends.
1082,19,1,40,ISTJ,2,"<neutrality>  I tend to focus on one. The reason is because they are careful to do even one thing properly. These days, I'm interested in Cali so I'm learning it."
1083,19,1,40,ISTJ,3,"<neutrality>  I seem to change depending on the situation. When it's assimilated enough, it cries, but when it doesn't, it doesn't seem to shed tears."
1084,19,1,40,ISTJ,4,"<no>  I tend to deal with things after they happen. I don't plan in advance, I tend to react right away when a situation arises."
1085,19,1,40,ISTJ,5,"<no>  I feel restless. As children's puberty, there is a lot of stress from the pressure from psychological conflicts. As a result, there were many cases of conflict with children, and there were many cases of restlessness."
1086,19,1,40,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  There are many difficulties in meeting new people. Because of my introverted nature, I feel more comfortable with people I already know than with new people."
1087,19,1,40,ISTJ,7,"<Yes>  I'm a person who can't do many things. In the past, I had an experience where I was working on several things at the same time but couldn't complete any of them. So I tend to do one thing right."
1088,19,1,40,ISTJ,8,<no>  I am a very down-to-earth person. It's because you usually judge the situation by considering realistic things.
1089,19,1,40,ISTJ,9,"<neutrality>  It depends. I use a diary when there are important things or things I need to remember, but I don't bother making plans for simple plans."
1090,19,1,40,ISTJ,10,"<Yes> When a child was having a hard time with rhinitis, I washed the child's nose with shallow knowledge, but rather, the child suffered from inflammation in the ear. At that time, I was upset that the child suffered because of my wrong knowledge."
1091,19,1,40,ISTJ,11,"<difficult>  It's hard for me to talk to new people. So, even if there is someone I'm interested in, I tend to keep an eye on them."
1092,19,1,40,ISTJ,12,<Yes>  I prefer reading related books or listening to experts to gain experience rather than debating.
1093,19,1,40,ISTJ,13,<Yes>  I try to judge everything rationally without consuming too much emotion.
1094,19,1,40,ISTJ,14,"<Yes>  When I make a plan, there are cases where I can't do what I want to do. So when something I want to do comes up, I do it right away."
1095,19,1,40,ISTJ,15,<no>  I tend to care a lot about other people's eyes. I tend to think a lot about whether my actions will harm those around me.
1096,19,1,40,ISTJ,16,<no>  I am more comfortable with individual activities than group activities. The reason is that I don't like hanging out with a lot of people.
1097,19,1,40,ISTJ,17,"<neutrality>  think it depends on the type. I've seen sci-fi movies, but it's a genre I'm usually interested in, so I enjoyed it. The ending was in progress, so it was good to have fun trying various interpretations. However, in the comedy genre, I think the experience of laughing out loud is more important than the ending."
1098,19,1,40,ISTJ,18,<Yes>  It is more rewarding to see others succeed with my help than myself.
1099,19,1,40,ISTJ,19,<no>  I tend to focus on one thing without paying attention to many things. I've had experiences where I've done a lot of things and not done them all properly.
1100,19,1,40,ISTJ,20,<Yes>  I worry a lot no matter what I do. I think it's because I've had an experience of failing at what I was doing.
1101,19,1,40,ISTJ,21,<Yes>  I don't like my role as a leader. The reason is that he is an introvert and does not like to step forward.
1102,19,1,40,ISTJ,22,<no>  I am very interested in the field of art. I've heard a lot of people say that I'm good at drawing.
1103,19,1,40,ISTJ,23,"<Yes>  I think that social conflicts intensify because people are so emotionally driven. If people were a little rational, it would be a world where social conflicts and crimes are less."
1104,19,1,40,ISTJ,24,"<Yes>  I don't feel like taking a break if I'm not organized. At least, I think rest is possible in a clean environment."
1105,19,1,40,ISTJ,25,"<no> When I see other people's arguments, I feel the stress of empathy, just like mine."
1106,19,1,40,ISTJ,26,<Yes>  I don't like to be in the spotlight. So I try not to feel the eyes of others.
1107,19,1,40,ISTJ,27,<no>  I don't think the change in emotions is great. It's because I'm on the side of trying to judge rationally.
1108,19,1,40,ISTJ,28,"<Yes> I'm not efficient at my work, so when I see someone like that, I get annoyed because I feel like they're looking at me. Even more so if my child is like that."
1109,19,1,40,ISTJ,29,<Yes>  I have been criticized by my spouse for not doing what I was supposed to do.
1110,19,1,40,ISTJ,30,<Yes>  I am rather interested in the afterlife. The reason is that they believe there is an afterlife.
1111,19,1,40,ISTJ,31,<no>  I seem to enjoy my time alone more than with other people these days.
1112,19,1,40,ISTJ,32,<Yes>  I think the theory or principle is too boring. I prefer being active rather than debating.
1113,19,1,40,ISTJ,33,"<no>  I prefer to hang out with people from similar backgrounds. Otherwise, you will feel very uncomfortable."
1114,19,1,40,ISTJ,34,"<Yes>  When I make a decision, I tend to think carefully, so I think about it until the end before making a decision."
1115,19,1,40,ISTJ,35,<no>  I often regret the decisions I have already made. So I often think again.
1116,19,1,40,ISTJ,36,<no>  I spend more time alone than parties or events. I feel very tired from parties or events.
1117,19,1,40,ISTJ,37,<Yes>  I am usually interested in art. That's why I like to visit art galleries and art works.
1118,19,1,40,ISTJ,38,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. It's easy to understand if you're in a situation similar to mine, but it's hard to understand the feelings about behavior that deviate from common sense."
1119,19,1,40,ISTJ,39,"<no>  I tend to improvise, so I don't like making plans."
1120,19,1,40,ISTJ,40,"<neutrality>  Depending on what you do, there are times when you feel anxious and there are times when you are not. But usually I don't feel too anxious."
1121,19,1,40,ISTJ,41,<Yes>  I often receive calls rather than make them. The reason is because they are not active.
1122,19,1,40,ISTJ,42,"<no>  I tend to try to make it easy to understand when opinions differ. People are different, so I guess opinions are different too."
1123,19,1,40,ISTJ,43,"<Yes>  I'm not active, so rather than asking to meet first, the other person asks to meet first."
1124,19,1,40,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  camping trip planned with an acquaintance last month was canceled, but I had an experience of rescheduling a camping plan in a hurry."
1125,19,1,40,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  I think a lot these days about the mistakes I made in the past. If so, I think that life would have been more comfortable now."
1126,19,1,40,ISTJ,46,"<Yes>  I don't think deeply about human existence, and I try to live hard in the given life now."
1127,19,1,40,ISTJ,47,"<Yes> I'm not sure, but I tend to hear a lot from my spouse telling me not to be swayed by the emotions around me."
1128,19,1,40,ISTJ,48,"<Yes>  I believe that anyone can make mistakes, so I tend to turn a blind eye to other people's mistakes."
1141,20,1,40,INTP,1,"<no>  I don't like meeting new friends. I have to use new energy, but sometimes it feels like an extension of work, so I'm tired."
1142,20,1,40,INTP,2,"<Yes> In my free time, I tend to read books or videos related to finance and finance. I especially like studying economics because it is fun to learn about history as well as human psychology in many ways."
1143,20,1,40,INTP,3,"<Yes>  You will cry along with that person. I empathize with him without even realizing it, and I am moved to tears, but there are times when I am embarrassed."
1144,20,1,40,INTP,4,"<no>  make plans before things start, but I'm not the type to make preparations. I'm on the insensitive side, and I don't know what could go wrong, but I think it's inefficient to make preparations."
1145,20,1,40,INTP,5,"<no>  I tend to have a hard time handling pressure, so I tend not to create that kind of environment or avoid jobs that are too heavy on responsibility."
1146,20,1,40,INTP,6,"<Yes>  At parties and events, I usually feel more comfortable talking to people I know. Meeting new people is uncomfortable because I feel like I am wearing a mask."
1147,20,1,40,INTP,7,"<Yes>  The bigger the scale, the more I tend to focus on one. If you do it at the same time, you can't concentrate and it seems that the sense of achievement is low."
1148,20,1,40,INTP,8,"<Yes>  It's sentimental. I usually prefer sentimental content, and I feel alive when I am sentimental."
1149,20,1,40,INTP,9,"<Yes>  I like to make plans in my diary. As your mind and surroundings are organized, your mind becomes calm."
1150,20,1,40,INTP,10,"<Yes>  When you make a mistake, you annoy yourself. I've had experiences in the past where I blamed myself for not doing things in a timely manner."
1151,20,1,40,INTP,11,"<no>  The more interested you are, the harder it is to talk to you. Because I don't know what the other person will think of me, it's not easy to step forward, and the fear of rejection is great, so I haven't even talked to most of them."
1152,20,1,40,INTP,12,"<no> I'm very interested. It's interesting because I'm curious about other people's thoughts, and it seems that my way of thinking is expanding to thoughts that are different from mine."
1153,20,1,40,INTP,13,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. I tend to follow my emotions in relationships and follow my reason when it comes to work.
1154,20,1,40,INTP,14,"<neutrality>  It depends. When it comes to work, it's important to get things done, so I tend to make plans, and I enjoy improvising when traveling or in my free time."
1155,20,1,40,INTP,15,<no>  tend to care about other people's eyes. I think there's a big reason why I don't want to be misunderstood.
1156,20,1,40,INTP,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy group activities. These days, I feel more comfortable being alone, so I don't socialize at all and read a book or go to a cafe by myself."
1157,20,1,40,INTP,17,"<Yes>  I like open endings. I think the story becomes richer if we interpret it in our own way. I think my liberation journal, which I enjoyed recently, was like that."
1158,20,1,40,INTP,18,"<no>  You feel more satisfied with your own success. I'm happy for others' success, but when I look back on myself, I think I'll be lonely."
1159,20,1,40,INTP,19,<Yes>  I have a lot of interests. There are times when you do a little bit of this and that and then you get stuck or you can't start at all. I think you need to be selective and focused.
1160,20,1,40,INTP,20,"<no> I'm not really worried. Rather than worrying about things going wrong, I tend to think about how to fix things when things go wrong."
1161,20,1,40,INTP,21,<Yes>  I absolutely want to avoid the leadership role. It's because I don't like to stand in front of others and the role is too burdensome.
1162,20,1,40,INTP,22,<no>  I think you have artistic inclinations. Because I have my own standards for beauty and I pursue it. I believe that art can breathe.
1163,20,1,40,INTP,23,"<neutrality>  Rather than giving more importance to emotions or reason, I think balance is more important. Reason without emotion is not possible, and emotion without reason is also difficult."
1164,20,1,40,INTP,24,<no>  I tend to take a break and recharge my energy before finishing my chores. I like to take it easy.
1165,20,1,40,INTP,25,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on who it is or on the subject. It's fun to see whose words are more persuasive.
1166,20,1,40,INTP,26,"<Yes>  I try not to attract other people's attention. Because the concentration of attention itself is burdensome, I sit in a corner or stay quiet to avoid being noticed."
1167,20,1,40,INTP,27,<Yes>  I tend to have emotional ups and downs. There were many cases in which I was sorry that I was easily annoyed with my close family over small things and then quickly let go.
1168,20,1,40,INTP,28,"<Yes> Honestly, it's frustrating to see people who aren't efficient. There are a lot of redundancies in execution, so it consumes a lot of energy unnecessarily, and it only adds to the worries."
1169,20,1,40,INTP,29,"<Yes>  At the beginning, I use it to gather energy, and at the end, I tend to focus on it and finish the job in a rush. It's a habit I want to break."
1170,20,1,40,INTP,30,"<Yes>  Besides the afterlife, I am interested in unknown worlds that are difficult for humans to reach, such as space and the deep sea. Curiosity is greater than fear."
1171,20,1,40,INTP,31,<no>  I prefer to be alone. I think it gives me comfort to be able to spend my time the way I want without worrying about my surroundings.
1172,20,1,40,INTP,32,"<Yes>  The discussion itself is interesting, but I think tabletop discussions are meaningless. When I see people who only talk in principle, I get the feeling that they are always hovering in place, and it is frustrating because there is no progress."
1173,20,1,40,INTP,33,"<no>  If you come from a different background, you can't relate. I don't think it's easy to empathize if the environment you've lived in is completely different, because what you've seen and heard while growing up is on a different level. You don't have to force empathy, you should try to understand instead."
1174,20,1,40,INTP,34,"<no>  tend to make decisions quickly. Even if I think carefully and decide, there is no guarantee that it will go my way, so I tend to make a quick decision and plan for the future."
1175,20,1,40,INTP,35,<Yes>  Decisions already made are irreversible in the past. I tend to think more about what comes next as a result of my decision.
1176,20,1,40,INTP,36,<no>  Parties and events add more fatigue. I tend to relieve my fatigue by reading a book or watching an entertainment program by myself.
1177,20,1,40,INTP,37,"<Yes>  love going to art galleries. When I go to an art museum when I am tired of my daily life, I feel refreshed and get new energy."
1178,20,1,40,INTP,38,"<Yes>  I think I'm on the side of lacking empathy when I think about myself. When the other person is having a hard time, I tend to focus on solving the problem rather than empathizing."
1179,20,1,40,INTP,39,"<neutrality> When it comes to work, I tend to make plans every day. Rather than liking making plans, I do it out of necessity. Instead, in the case of travel, only the place and accommodation are decided and improvised."
1180,20,1,40,INTP,40,"<Yes>  I don't think I've ever felt insecure. There was no trigger, and I think my innate tendency is insensitive."
1181,20,1,40,INTP,41,"<neutrality> Depends on the other party. In the case of a close person or work-related work, it is more convenient to make a phone call for quick communication, and texting is more convenient if the relationship is ambiguous or there is only a little acquaintance."
1182,20,1,40,INTP,42,"<no>  If you don't agree, I tend to just ignore it. But if it's something you haven't thought about, take it positively."
1183,20,1,40,INTP,43,"<no>  There are very few such cases. I like to be alone, so I don't contact you first unless there is a specific purpose."
1184,20,1,40,INTP,44,"<no>  Don't go back, make a new plan according to the unexpected situation. There was a disruption to a work appointment not too long ago, but I arranged a new schedule accordingly. In everything we do, we always keep the unexpected situation in mind."
1185,20,1,40,INTP,45,"<no>  I tend to forget about it. I regret not being too interested in financial technology in my 20s, but I keep my regrets short and focus more on what I need to do in the future."
1186,20,1,40,INTP,46,"<no>  Not very interested. We live because we were born, and rather than the reason for living, we focus more on how to lead our lives in the future."
1187,20,1,40,INTP,47,"<Yes>  There are emotional ups and downs. In particular, there are many times when I can't control my emotions to my family, and my family is also having a hard time. I feel ashamed of myself for this."
1188,20,1,40,INTP,48,<no> Right and wrong first. I think it's a loss of face when the other person doesn't admit their fault. Admitting wrongdoing is saving face.
1201,21,1,30,INFP,1,"<no>  I tend to pay a lot of attention to human relationships, so it feels difficult to increase new management targets. Even now, there are enough good people around me, so I don't feel like dating anyone."
1202,21,1,30,INFP,2,"<Yes> When I have free time, I tend to use my cell phone or the Internet to quickly find information that interests me. Recently, I've been paying a lot of attention to local history."
1203,21,1,30,INFP,3,"<neutrality>  Anyone who has a relationship with me easily assimilates to my emotions and sheds tears with me. In the case of someone who is not involved, I feel embarrassed and want to soothe them."
1204,21,1,30,INFP,4,<Yes>  tend to have at least two more plans in case things don't go as planned. It's because you think that the world doesn't go as you want.
1205,21,1,30,INFP,5,"<neutrality>  It's hard to keep my composure if it's pressure from someone I have a high connection with. If the relevance is low, you can think it's good and let it go well. Communication with parents is especially difficult."
1206,21,1,30,INFP,6,"<Yes>  tend to find people I already know and talk to them. It's because I feel especially nervous in a group of people, so it's even more uncomfortable to have a conversation with a new person who is already difficult."
1207,21,1,30,INFP,7,"<Yes>  Even if I move to another job, I keep thinking about what I was doing before, so I can't concentrate. If possible, I try to finish one project entirely before starting the next one."
1208,21,1,30,INFP,8,"<no> When you feel a certain emotion, you must find the reason for the emotion and understand it with your head. If you don't understand the reason, if you don't understand the turbulence, you will rather be in a state of numbness."
1209,21,1,30,INFP,9,"<Yes>  It's rare that I get to run on time, but I guess I like it when I see that I'm consistently writing a schedule. My main tool is my cell phone calendar app."
1210,21,1,30,INFP,10,"<Yes> When we make a mistake, we dwell on the experience for a long time. Recently, I kept thinking about things I couldn't tell the person looking for lost items that I had seen them. I remember thinking for a long time that I should have told you even though I was uncertain."
1211,21,1,30,INFP,11,"<no>  It's better if you have work or a common topic, but approaching the other person without knowing what topics they're interested in feels almost like torture to me."
1212,21,1,30,INFP,12,"<neutrality> It's fun to hear different impressions from different people. However, as much as understanding the work itself, I am motivated to understand what the other person I am talking to thinks. I don't want to share my interpretation with anyone."
1213,21,1,30,INFP,13,"<no>  I usually try to follow reason and think of analysis and countermeasures, but in reality I tend to act as I please. Rather than dividing emotions and reason, think of them as a unified self, and follow your inner motivation at the moment of choice."
1214,21,1,30,INFP,14,"<neutrality>  Always plan what to do that day. I tend to do things that I have planned to do, although I tend to be spontaneous and often leak into side roads."
1215,21,1,30,INFP,15,"<neutrality>  I tend to worry about how I look to people I like. When I am in a crowd that has nothing to do with me, I feel free because there are no restrictions on my actions."
1216,21,1,30,INFP,16,<no> Group activities are frustrating. I enjoy individual activities and prefer to keep group movements to a minimum.
1217,21,1,30,INFP,17,"<neutrality> If it's a work that allows you to immerse yourself in the author's world, it's good to have an open ending or a closed ending as the author intended. If the story is sloppy and makes you think, 'If it were me, I would have done it this way', I prefer an ending that leaves room for imagination. The strange lawyer Woo Young-woo, whom I recently saw, was able to enjoy the ending satisfactorily in that respect."
1218,21,1,30,INFP,18,"<no>  Helping others is satisfying, but less so than doing it yourself. I think there is bound to be a difference between direct experience and indirect experience."
1219,21,1,30,INFP,19,"<Yes>  When I accumulate things I want to do, even though I am not obligated to do things like an online lecture I paid for because I was interested in it, a book I bought because it looked interesting, or a drama recommended by a friend, I began to think about how to distribute my free time."
1220,21,1,30,INFP,20,"<no>  I think it's luck. After I've done all I can, I leave it to chance."
1221,21,1,30,INFP,21,"<Yes> First of all, the process of leading is cumbersome, and the increasing number of objects to manage is stressful in itself. I feel more responsible and burdened than necessary for the results."
1222,21,1,30,INFP,22,"<no>  I love and enjoy singing, drawing, writing poetry and making crafts with my hands."
1223,21,1,30,INFP,23,"<Yes>  It's not because emotions aren't needed, but I think it should be a world based on rational judgment and decision-making. At least more than now."
1224,21,1,30,INFP,24,"<neutrality>  It depends. Usually, I prefer to take care of what I have to do first and then take a break, but when I am really tired, I take a break first while drinking coffee and gather my energy to do housework."
1225,21,1,30,INFP,25,"<neutrality> It would be fun if there were any fun elements. You can enjoy watching logical battles, or you can laugh at stupid horsetailing. A boring debate about a topic you don't care about doesn't sound like fun to watch."
1226,21,1,30,INFP,26,"<Yes>  Being in the spotlight can make you nervous and awkward. Even during my school days, I didn't take on a role in presenting because of my nervous habit."
1227,21,1,30,INFP,27,"<no> The amplitude is not large, and the cycle of changing emotions is not that fast. When it sinks, it sinks heavily and feels happy, sad, and various emotions in the stagnant state, and when it flies, it feels happy and sad while floating in the air."
1228,21,1,30,INFP,28,"<no>  I think each person's preference is different. I think he could have done the way I do it efficiently. However, in case you haven't tried it, I'm trying to tell you my method carefully so that it doesn't look like I'm conceited."
1229,21,1,30,INFP,29,<Yes>  Often it is. It seems that I make the same mistake every time because I lose the desire to procrastinate and overconfident that I can do it right away.
1230,21,1,30,INFP,30,"<Yes>  I think it's romantic. This is because each person's thoughts about the afterlife eventually explain what they want, 'What will happen to the relationship here and now?'"
1231,21,1,30,INFP,31,"<no>  I feel comfortable when I am alone. It's not just at home, it likes outdoor activities like walking, biking and swimming, but it's nice to go and play alone. Doing it with someone else is about 3 times harder."
1232,21,1,30,INFP,32,"<no>  The theory-based discussions are also fun. The logical structure is well made, and when workshops come and go, it feels like playing a well-made game."
1233,21,1,30,INFP,33,<Yes>  This is possible if you are motivated to understand others as whole persons who have been brought up in their respective backgrounds. The effect of reading a novel seems to come from this.
1234,21,1,30,INFP,34,"<no>  Such an important matter should be resolved quickly, but if you try to postpone it, it will interfere with your daily life. I tend to try to deal with it as quickly as possible because it keeps running through my head."
1235,21,1,30,INFP,35,"<no>  Even if I've already made a decision, I tend to revisit the possible options when I have the time. However, since the choice was usually made after sufficient consideration, it is not easy to overturn the choice made, and it is investigated to use it as a material for judgment in a similar situation next time."
1236,21,1,30,INFP,36,"<no>  can only regenerate energy when I am alone. Spending time surrounded by loved ones is fun, but at the same time it can be tiring. If you don't have time to be alone for a day, you have to endure the next week as a super corpse."
1237,21,1,30,INFP,37,"<Yes>  I like drawing, but more than that, I like crafts. It's thrilling to find devices that artisans have intentionally put in elaborately crafted works."
1238,21,1,30,INFP,38,"<neutrality> Not so with those close to you, but the feelings of an unrelated person are hard to understand. Maybe it's because I have no motivation to understand."
1239,21,1,30,INFP,39,<Yes>  I like to declare in the morning that I have to do something today. That way you can usually get it done without missing anything.
1240,21,1,30,INFP,40,"<Yes>  When I was young, I tended to have anxiety about relationships, but as I got older and my family and friends relationships came within a predictable range, my great anxiety disappeared."
1241,21,1,30,INFP,41,"<Yes>  If there is a public purpose or business reason, I prefer to make a trail with text. This is because things are less likely to be skipped and can be edited before sending."
1242,21,1,30,INFP,42,"<neutrality>  Depends on the opponent. If you have a close relationship with me and this topic is very important, both of you should work hard until you understand, no matter how much time you spend. If it's a good opponent, I'm inclined to think so."
1243,21,1,30,INFP,43,"<Yes>  No matter how much KakaoTalk or phone you have, you have to meet to be friends. If we have to meet anyway, I tend to ask them to meet first in order to induce the time to meet at the same timing when I have just finished an important job, when I have enough energy left."
1244,21,1,30,INFP,44,<no> Find another plan within the route you have already entered. I don't think there was any original plan that must go back. A similar thing happened to me recently when I was trying to find directions in a travel destination.
1245,21,1,30,INFP,45,"<no>  I tend to look back a lot on my recent mistakes and choices and imagine the possibilities I had not made. If it's a mistake made a long time ago, there are no regrets or impressions left because you've already chewed it over enough to chew it over. If there is a lesson learned then, it is because it is already melted in my behavior."
1246,21,1,30,INFP,46,"<Yes>  The reason for existence and life is that only those who have lived through that life are qualified to speak, so it seems meaningless to expand it to human beings. And because I believe that what I see is real rather than what I say, I will try to live my life diligently so that I can leave a good image later."
1247,21,1,30,INFP,47,"<no>  The amplitude of emotions is not large enough to be particularly controlled, or the cycle of change is not frequent. Even when my emotions are intensified, I have the confidence that I am observing myself like that in my heart, so I have never made a mistake."
1248,21,1,30,INFP,48,"<neutrality> It depends on the size of the opponent's fault, my liking for the other person, and the mental composure I have that day. If it's not an irreversible mistake, I don't hate the other person as a human being, and there's no big stress for me, I usually go over it smoothly."
1261,22,1,40,ISFJ,1,"<no>  I don't feel comfortable talking to people I don't know well. Even if there are people I want to be close to, I'm not the type to approach them actively."
1262,22,1,40,ISFJ,2,"<Yes> When an interest arises, I tend to focus on it until I know everything about it. These days, I'm diligently looking into overseas travel. Accommodation, flights, restaurants, travel courses, etc."
1263,22,1,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  Maybe I'm in menopause, so when I see other people crying, I shed a lot of tears as well. As I get older, I seem to be able to share experiences and emotions better than when I was young."
1264,22,1,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I always make at least one other contingency plan whenever I plan something or have an important event ahead. For example, when you go on a trip, if the itinerary you plan to go on is wrong, you can do something else right away, so you can plan another trip in advance."
1265,22,1,40,ISFJ,5,"<no>  Until my 20s and 30s, I kept my composure well, but these days, maybe because I have a lot of stress, I often get angry over trivial things. When children did something wrong, I used to ask them why first, but these days they start screaming."
1266,22,1,40,ISFJ,6,<Yes>  like to talk to someone who knows me well and is comfortable with me. Introducing myself to strangers isn't fun for me.
1267,22,1,40,ISFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. The reason is that if it is something very important to me, I don't think I will participate in other projects. However, most of the time, if it is possible to do something in parallel, I tend to do it together."
1268,22,1,40,ISFJ,8,"<neutrality>  am sentimental at times, but as I raise my children, I seem to be becoming more and more realistic. I think it's because there are more and more problems to be solved in reality."
1269,22,1,40,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  I like to plan things by the hour. In my case, I have a habit of writing down each day's schedule on my calendar at least one month in advance."
1270,22,1,40,ISFJ,10,"<neutrality>  feel really uncomfortable when things don't go as planned because it's my mistake. But rather than constantly beating myself up, I prefer to get things done quickly and successfully."
1271,22,1,40,ISFJ,11,"<no>  Even if I want to talk to someone I'm interested in, it's difficult. I want to be close to my child's school friend's mother, and even if such a place is arranged, I regret not being able to talk much and come home. Even after receiving the contact, there are many cases where we are unable to contact you first."
1272,22,1,40,ISFJ,12,<Yes>  like things realistic. So the interest in art works is not high.
1273,22,1,40,ISFJ,13,<neutrality>  I'm different sometimes. Important personal issues are strictly followed by the opposite sex. But a lot of the rest is emotionally resolved.
1274,22,1,40,ISFJ,14,"<no>  I don't like unplanned things and I'm anxious. It's because if you work spontaneously, something unpredictable will happen."
1275,22,1,40,ISFJ,15,<Yes>  I seem to think a lot about what others think of my words and actions. Maybe that's why it's hard to make friends with strangers. But there doesn't seem to be any particular reason.
1276,22,1,40,ISFJ,16,"<neutrality>  know that doing new things with new people is a great experience. I'm not an extrovert, so group activities like this aren't comfortable for me, but if I can have a good experience, I tend to participate."
1277,22,1,40,ISFJ,17,"<no>  I often read books or movies without thinking, and even if the ending goes beyond my expectations, I tend to focus more on what the author intended."
1278,22,1,40,ISFJ,18,"<no>  am timid, but I also seem to have ambition in my heart. I feel more satisfaction in my own success than in the success of others."
1279,22,1,40,ISFJ,19,"<no>  I never really have a lot of interests. I tend to be indifferent to things that have nothing to do with me, and now I seem to have less enthusiasm to do new things."
1280,22,1,40,ISFJ,20,"<Yes>  tend to do almost everything with a plan. When my plans go wrong, it is a very anxious situation for me, and the coming of an uncontrollable situation is stressful. I worry a lot that if things go wrong, I might hurt someone or stress someone out."
1281,22,1,40,ISFJ,21,"<neutrality>  I'm not going to step out, but I tend to do it if I think the right person is me. I don't hate being a leader."
1282,22,1,40,ISFJ,22,"<Yes>  think the biggest thing was that I grew up with realistic parents from a young age. In a less wealthy family, art was not a priority for me."
1283,22,1,40,ISFJ,23,<no>  I know that emotions play a huge role in crime. But I know people who value emotions are trying to make the world a better place. I think we can respect and love others more by focusing on emotions rather than personal interests and safety.
1284,22,1,40,ISFJ,24,"<Yes>  All my breaks are done after finishing the chores. If you take a break without finishing, you can't rest because your mind is uncomfortable."
1285,22,1,40,ISFJ,25,<no>  Seeing other people's arguments is a stressful situation for me. I seem to get insecure when other people aren't very comfortable.
1286,22,1,40,ISFJ,26,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on the situation. If I'm at a disadvantage, of course I don't draw attention. But if I'm in a situation where I stand out, I think I'll try to get attention."
1287,22,1,40,ISFJ,27,"<Yes>  These days, I'm in the menopause, so my mood changes quickly. This is especially true when raising children."
1288,22,1,40,ISFJ,28,"<Yes>  tend to get annoyed when I think about why I do this but that person can only do that. For example, my children are very slow because they are the style of scholars, but I get annoyed thinking about why they take care of everything so late. It's because you think that if you do it quickly, you can handle other things more."
1289,22,1,40,ISFJ,29,"<no>  When I have something to do, I take care of it and take a break. If I don't finish, I feel uncomfortable and I can't do other things well."
1290,22,1,40,ISFJ,30,"<neutrality>  I have very strong anxiety about death. I'm interested in it because I wish there was an afterlife and I want a very positive response to it, but I don't think it's interesting."
1291,22,1,40,ISFJ,31,"<no>  I used to like doing things with others rather than alone time, but these days I tend to enjoy alone time more. This is convenient."
1292,22,1,40,ISFJ,32,"<no>  I think it's not boring, but rather good, because I think it can be believed only when the theory is supported. And I think it's about gaining knowledge."
1293,22,1,40,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  tend to think of myself as being very good at empathy. I can sympathize with what they do and say because they come from different backgrounds, but I don't think they're in a good state emotionally. I understand myself and others with my head, but I often don't understand with my heart."
1294,22,1,40,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  I depend on the matter of work. I tend to make quick decisions about things that don't matter much, and I tend to leave my choices as carefully as possible to the last when it comes to things that affect me a lot."
1295,22,1,40,ISFJ,35,"<neutrality>  tend to try not to change a decision I've already made, but when I get important information to change a decision, I do."
1296,22,1,40,ISFJ,36,"<no>  I'm much happier these days at home with my family. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I got energy from crowded places, but these days I like being quiet."
1297,22,1,40,ISFJ,37,"<neutrality>  I haven't been to art museums that many times, and I haven't had many opportunities to come into contact with them. Even when I went there, I hadn't been particularly moved by the art, so I never thought I'd enjoy it, but a few years ago, I saw the work of artist Eva Armisen at the Cheonan Arts Center and thought that such a piece of art could touch people's heart. I want to experience the many works of art that move me."
1298,22,1,40,ISFJ,38,"<neutrality>  First of all, I feel good when I sympathize with the good feelings that others feel. However, it is often difficult to relate to the bad feelings of others. Why can't that person just do that? why can't you stand it? You seem to be thinking about this a lot."
1299,22,1,40,ISFJ,39,"<Yes>  When I wake up in the morning, I plan what I have to do almost every hour and put it into practice."
1300,22,1,40,ISFJ,40,"<no>  I always have a lot of anxiety. It seems like it's been like this since I was a kid. I had a very big surgery when I was 6 years old, and it seems that my anxiety has increased since then."
1301,22,1,40,ISFJ,41,"<neutrality>  I enjoy talking on the phone with people I am close to and comfortable with, even if I cannot meet them. But I want to avoid talking to people who are uncomfortable."
1302,22,1,40,ISFJ,42,"<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand my opinions and others. I think I have very lenient standards for understanding others. But even so, if you have a very different opinion from me, I almost give up. I think you are not the one to go with."
1303,22,1,40,ISFJ,43,"<no> In the past, I used to contact the friends I wanted to meet first. But these days I don't want to meet anyone."
1304,22,1,40,ISFJ,44,"<Yes>  hate to deviate from my plans. My child always goes to coding academy on Saturdays, and I always pick him up by car to the coding academy. But the day before the coding class, my husband said he wanted to use the car that day to go fishing. It was unexpected, and I was so angry that I had to miss school to go fishing. However, I thought it would be nice for my husband to relieve stress after a long time and have some personal time, so I gave the car to the groom and picked up the child by bicycle. I don't have to go to an academy once, but I like to put my plans into practice."
1305,22,1,40,ISFJ,45,"<no>  regret my mistakes long ago, but I try not to dwell on them for too long. Because I don't want to put my energy into the past. I tend to focus on the future."
1306,22,1,40,ISFJ,46,"<neutrality>  think I live because I was born. Because we were not born because we wanted to be born. However, since I was born, I believe that I should live a happy and worthwhile life. In particular, I hope that the children I give birth to will enjoy a noble and happiest life because they are born not of their choice, but of my own."
1307,22,1,40,ISFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I tend to try to control my emotions, but sometimes I let them explode."
1308,22,1,40,ISFJ,48,"<neutrality> I've never been that much of an adult's fault, but I try to keep my spirits up when it comes to children's faults. Because children are learning. It's because I think I can grow into a more right and good person."
1321,23,0,30,INTP,1,"<neutrality>  The reason is that when I make a new friend, I don't try to make it because I have to work hard to show new energy and myself to that friend."
1322,23,0,30,INTP,2,"<Yes> The world changes so fast. If you don't change according to the times, you can fall behind, so you have to study various interests to participate in conversations with various organizations."
1323,23,0,30,INTP,3,"<no>  I try to find out why other people are crying and listen to the other person's grief as much as possible. Crying together doesn't make the problem go away, so we don't grieve together."
1324,23,0,30,INTP,4,"<Yes>  tend to set up a lot of countermeasures because if I don't prepare a countermeasure, a small loss can turn into a bigger problem several times or even dozens of times. In particular, since unforeseen problems can occur, you need to prepare for various contingency plans."
1325,23,0,30,INTP,5,"<no>  It's hard to keep calm when the pressure is high. When I have to deal with high-ranking people in my work life, I have to be careful with my answers, but I have made mistakes many times because I was nervous."
1326,23,0,30,INTP,6,"<Yes>  Rather than introducing someone new, meeting someone you know to get a feel for the atmosphere, sharing a situation you relate to with someone you already know, and getting to know someone new makes you less likely to make mistakes with someone new."
1327,23,0,30,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  If possible, I try to complete one project, but more urgent projects arise in the middle, and in such a situation, I try to handle the urgent work first."
1328,23,0,30,INTP,8,"<no>  If you get tangled up in your feelings, rather than solving the problem, you may come to a standstill, so you try to keep your cool and make rational decisions."
1329,23,0,30,INTP,9,"<no>  Even if you set a schedule, various variables may occur, and trying to implement the plan can feel like a new task, so I try to move as spontaneously as possible."
1330,23,0,30,INTP,10,"<Yes>  Even very easy problems were often solved by thinking hard or making mistakes. However, I used to blame myself for not sticking to the basics after seeing the new employee solve the problem so easily."
1331,23,0,30,INTP,11,"<Yes>  If interested, I try to appeal myself. I think it's a more rational decision to gather up the courage to approach and have a conversation when you're alone."
1332,23,0,30,INTP,12,"<Yes>  Art is a field that can be evaluated infinitely differently depending on the perspective of the viewer, so I think it is contradictory to express one's own analysis using the expression of interpretation."
1333,23,0,30,INTP,13,"<Yes>  When you let your emotions come out, you can make things that are easy to solve difficult. A lot of people around me say 'I'm calm, and I don't think there will be any blood or tears'."
1334,23,0,30,INTP,14,"<Yes>  Since making a schedule itself is allotting the time given to me, I don't bother making a plan unless it's a project or task that needs to be systematically addressed."
1335,23,0,30,INTP,15,"<Yes> First impressions and personalities determine how people treat others. If the first impression is reflected as a bad person, even if you have the same conversation, it is often difficult to have a conversation in the desired direction due to prejudice."
1336,23,0,30,INTP,16,"<neutrality>  I tend to participate in group activities if they can fulfill my purpose, but I tend not to participate if I have to sacrifice my personal goals for the sake of unity. These days, I don't have a group life besides my personal life."
1337,23,0,30,INTP,17,"<no>  I like works that have a fixed ending but unexpected results. This is because reasoning about the director's intention is another fun part of watching the work. I like works in the style of 'Identity', 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Shawshank Redemption'."
1338,23,0,30,INTP,18,"<neutrality> I'm a bit selfish because I can help others only when I succeed myself, but I prioritize my own success. However, if a little sacrifice is helpful to others several times, sometimes they sacrifice themselves."
1339,23,0,30,INTP,19,"<Yes> In the 21st century, it is difficult to keep up with trends that are ahead of only one field, so you have to pay attention to various parts, and if that happens, it is often difficult to concentrate on one thing. This is because even when you sign a contract for a house, you need to have basic cultural knowledge in various specialized fields such as real estate, law, and accounting to avoid fraud."
1340,23,0,30,INTP,20,"<neutrality>  Usually, I tend to worry, but when things do happen, I don't worry too much because the problem isn't as big as I was worried about. However, I tend to prepare several countermeasures."
1341,23,0,30,INTP,21,"<neutrality>  The leader is the one in charge. I want to avoid it as much as possible because taking responsibility is very burdensome. When opinions are divided on an equal footing, I often suggest a direction by organizing opinions."
1342,23,0,30,INTP,22,"<Yes> Usually people with artistic inclinations have their own color. However, I judge that I do not have an artistic inclination because I pursue a style that is not very prominent and that the public likes on average."
1343,23,0,30,INTP,23,"<Yes>  Reasonable judgment would be able to solve problems more efficiently, and then it would have developed into a better world because there was no unnecessary waste of resources."
1344,23,0,30,INTP,24,"<no> When you start doing housework, it consumes a lot of energy and you try to finish it roughly, so you can take enough rest and gather energy to build up your strength to finish the housework more neatly."
1345,23,0,30,INTP,25,"<Yes>  By watching an argument, you can read the person's thoughts and identify their tendencies. In particular, when a more creative agenda comes up that I hadn't even thought of, it becomes an opportunity for me to develop myself by imitating that person's ideas."
1346,23,0,30,INTP,26,"<neutrality>  try to draw attention to my positive parts, but I try to hide my negative parts as much as possible."
1347,23,0,30,INTP,27,"<neutrality>  Of course, when the predicted positive outcome turns out to be negative, the emotional ups and downs become very severe. If stocks that you thought would go up naturally go down, you will be surrounded by negative thoughts throughout the day."
1348,23,0,30,INTP,28,"<Yes> When I see people who are unable to resolve their work due to emotions, or who are working inefficiently because of their customs and beliefs for no other reason, I often advise them to put their emotions aside and not waste unnecessary time."
1349,23,0,30,INTP,29,"<Yes>  I decided to do company work, but when I have a meeting due to contact from acquaintances, I put off the work until the deadline. Recently, I have been putting off work because of meetings with acquaintances."
1350,23,0,30,INTP,30,"<Yes>  I think the afterlife is very interesting because it is something everyone has to go through, and it is a problem that cannot be solved with current science and technology. It is fun to analyze whether people who have experienced the afterlife are false or whether they have experienced it themselves."
1351,23,0,30,INTP,31,"<neutrality>  There are times when alone time is comfortable, and there are times when spending time together is fun. It seems to be different depending on when you have to do something."
1352,23,0,30,INTP,32,"<no>  I am interested in discussions that need to produce results, not discussions without results. I don't think discussions are boring because there are many things to come to conclusions in my work, but I think philosophical discussions are a waste of time."
1353,23,0,30,INTP,33,<Yes>  I can fully sympathize with you because there is more to learn from the thoughts and judgments of people who have lived a different background than mine.
1354,23,0,30,INTP,34,"<neutrality>  If I have to make a decision carefully, I tend to make a decision after considering it as deeply as possible, and I tend to make a decision quickly when it is not a major issue."
1355,23,0,30,INTP,35,"<no>  Amendments are made if there is a problem with the decision or other variables arise. It's the best decision you've ever made, but there are other reasons that make it better inside the car."
1356,23,0,30,INTP,36,"<neutrality>  When I'm tired, I spend time alone, and when I want to have fun, I tend to chat loudly with my friends. This method is not convenient either in the past or now."
1357,23,0,30,INTP,37,"<Yes>  I don't make any decisions, I like to look at the work without thinking and be blank. However, it does not deeply interpret the work of art."
1358,23,0,30,INTP,38,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it's hard to understand, but I'm trying to understand. For example, a friend secretly opened a shop, but he did not tell his friends about it, and they were upset."
1359,23,0,30,INTP,39,"<no>  tend not to plan very well. Planning itself takes up my free time, and it rarely goes according to plan. If it's not a project or something that needs to be done carefully, it's improvised."
1360,23,0,30,INTP,40,"<neutrality>  You feel anxious, but if you prepare for that anxiety, your worries will decrease. There is no problem that can be solved by just worrying."
1361,23,0,30,INTP,41,"<Yes>  would like to avoid non-business calls as much as possible. Because it's important to look at the other person's expression and reaction in a conversation, but it's difficult to catch that part over the phone, so I prefer to have a face-to-face conversation."
1362,23,0,30,INTP,42,"<neutrality>  If the other person is important to me, I try to understand as much as possible. At first, I tried to persuade the other person if I did not understand, but in the process, more disputes occurred, so I tried to understand from the other person's point of view."
1363,23,0,30,INTP,43,"<neutrality>  In some cases, we contact you first, and in others we wait for you to contact us. It depends on who you are meeting."
1364,23,0,30,INTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, we try to come up with a new plan quickly in that situation. This is usually the case when, due to schedule fluctuations during work, the planned tasks are left behind and tasks that need to be addressed quickly are handled quickly."
1365,23,0,30,INTP,45,"<Yes>  There were many times when I couldn't treat my girlfriend who I dated a long time ago for various reasons. In retrospect, it was a really bad move and I promise myself I won't do it now."
1366,23,0,30,INTP,46,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I think deeply about what humans are supposed to do. When I see people with completely different tendencies being born in similar environments, I think that way."
1367,23,0,30,INTP,47,"<neutrality>  I am often swayed by my emotions, but I try to quickly resolve the situation and return to reason. I think the people around me have a strong rational tendency."
1368,23,0,30,INTP,48,"<neutrality> If it's a mistake between very close friends, they make fun of it as a joke, but if it's a relationship that requires a little distance, I try to cover the mistake as much as possible. The reason is that the limit for maintaining a relationship with the other person is different depending on the level of intimacy. In the case of close friends, making fun of mistakes is actually more comfortable."
1381,24,0,40,ENFP,1,"<no> I'm not a student at school, so it's impossible because there are few opportunities. The reason seems to be that there is no opportunity to make new friends besides co-workers, and since I am loyal to my family, I do not have time to make new friends because I do not go to social gatherings outside."
1382,24,0,40,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  I'm very interested in removing car scratches these days. The reason is that the car has a lot of scratches, so I tried several times, but it's not perfect, so I'm interested in seeing if I can do it perfectly."
1383,24,0,40,ENFP,3,"<no>  get annoyed when I see other people crying. There's no particular reason, but it's annoying, angry, and I want to avoid it."
1384,24,0,40,ENFP,4,"<Yes>  For most of my work, I tend to make preparations for the occasion. The reason is that I had failed experiences while doing many things without any preparation, and I tend to set up one or two basic preparations based on those things."
1385,24,0,40,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  I maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. If it's a recent experience, it's been a while, but when I couldn't pay off a loan in my early 30s, there were a lot of things, such as people coming to my house to get money and even to work. At that time, I managed to solve everything while maintaining my composure and showed good results."
1386,24,0,40,ENFP,6,"<Yes>  At parties and events, I usually talk to people I know without introducing or introducing myself. The reason seems to be that they don't know the timing to introduce first, and they feel shy and lack confidence."
1387,24,0,40,ENFP,7,"<Yes>  After I fully complete one project, I start another. The reason is that if you work on several projects together, you will definitely go wrong or make a lot of mistakes. There were times when I made mistakes."
1388,24,0,40,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  I think I'm very sentimental. The reason is that when I watch TV at the cinema or at home, I am completely immersed in the movie, and when the main character is happy or sad, I also cry, feel lonely, or be happy."
1389,24,0,40,ENFP,9,"<Yes>  like to plan things in my diary as a schedule or list. The reason is that I didn't do that when I was single before, but since I was married and had a child, I had to set up a schedule or plan. A diary is better than an electronic tool."
1390,24,0,40,ENFP,10,<no>  I don't doubt my abilities or knowledge over small mistakes. The reason is that I am confident in my ability to work and accept mistakes as mistakes. And I'm not interested in things I can't do.
1391,24,0,40,ENFP,11,"<no>  Even if I'm interested in someone, I have a hard time approaching them and starting a conversation. The reason is that most of the time, rather than going to the person you are interested in and having a conversation with, I talked to three people around me, accompanied them and an acquaintance, started a conversation with the person next to me, and later I joined the conversation."
1392,24,0,40,ENFP,12,"<Yes>  I know something about works of art, but I'm not very interested in discussing interpretations. The reason is that since I was young, I also dreamed of becoming a painter, so I used to draw many works of art. However, it seems that deeper understanding and discussion are not my interests."
1393,24,0,40,ENFP,13,"<Yes>  I think I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. The reason is that when dealing with many people at work, conflicts sometimes occur, but rather than fighting each other, we think, judge, and deal with them rationally. Even the people around me say the same."
1394,24,0,40,ENFP,14,"<neutrality> There are times when I plan my day and there are times when I want to improvise. The reason is that, in light of my experience, in setting a schedule for a month in advance, I perfectly plan things that are planned in advance and improvise things that do not have a schedule."
1395,24,0,40,ENFP,15,"<no>  I don't worry about who I look to others. The reason is that before I got married, I was worried about what kind of person everyone around me would see me as. But after we got married, that thought went away."
1396,24,0,40,ENFP,16,"<no>  I do not enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is that I think time alone is more precious than time participating in group activities. I think it is because the family is a small group and the workplace is also a group, so time alone is important."
1397,24,0,40,ENFP,17,"<no> Even if I watch a movie or a book, it can be said that I hate things without an ending. The reason is that I think the author of a movie or book has to make the ending. If the ending is made vaguely, you get entangled in it and fall into a dilemma. so i don't like it"
1398,24,0,40,ENFP,18,<no>  I find no satisfaction in helping others succeed rather than myself. The reason is because I am also trying to be successful. I think sacrificing myself and helping others is possible at a young age.
1399,24,0,40,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  I have a lot of interests. So many times I don't know what to do first. The reason is that most of them are exposed to social media such as YouTube, so they focus on what attracts attention, and when they become interested, they try to practice it. Then, a lot of interests arise, and I prepare materials for each interest, but due to time constraints, I can't do everything together, and I want to do it quickly, but then give up."
1400,24,0,40,ENFP,20,"<Yes>  I often worry about going wrong even in the smallest things. I don't think there's anything special about the reason. Ever since I was little, I was always worried that things might go wrong, and I am still worried about the same."
1401,24,0,40,ENFP,21,"<no>  want to work in a leadership role in an organization. The reason is that I know a lot about myself and think that I am superior to others. The reality will be different, but I always want to take on a leadership role in the organization as much as possible."
1402,24,0,40,ENFP,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that I have imitated art well since I was young and have also dealt with musical instruments for 16 years. Because of this, I think there is little artistic inclination."
1403,24,0,40,ENFP,23,"<no>  I don't think the world would be a better place if reason was more important than emotion. The reason is that there are many countries, cities, companies, and families in the world. I don't think all of these people live with only emotions, nor do they live with only reason. It is because reason and emotions are used together according to the situation. In this way, the family is the emotion, and the opposite sex is the opposite."
1404,24,0,40,ENFP,24,"<Yes>  I like to finish my chores before going to bed. The reason is because when you take a break, you relax in a pleasant environment. When I take a break, if the housework is not finished, I think it is annoying because I have to do housework again after the break."
1405,24,0,40,ENFP,25,<no>  don't look at other people's arguments. The reason is that I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments because I don't care about other people's arguments and sometimes I get involved in other people's arguments.
1406,24,0,40,ENFP,26,"<Yes>  try not to attract other people's attention. I think the reason is that I don't want a lot of work to happen. Because in everything, getting someone else's attention always takes over or something bothers you. It's easier to just keep quiet and not draw attention from others."
1407,24,0,40,ENFP,27,"<no> My emotions don't change very quickly. The reason is, for example, before being appointed as a manager at work, I thought I was a powerful manager and I was very happy. However, another person was promoted to manager, and the feeling at that time was to hate the job and do it, but it wasn't. Rather, I remember thinking that I had to do better and working hard. It's fleeting, but I don't think the feelings changed very quickly."
1408,24,0,40,ENFP,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed when I see people who aren't as effective as I am. The reason is that it often happens in the current workplace. There are people who have to finish their work within the same time every day, but some people are not able to get it done efficiently. That makes me annoyed and angry."
1409,24,0,40,ENFP,29,"<no>  never put things off until the end. The reason is that what I have to do is directly related to myself, and if I don't do it, it will cause disadvantage or inconvenience, so I think it's right to do it quickly when I can. Even lately, there is no time to put things off until the end."
1410,24,0,40,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  think the question of the afterlife is interesting. The reason is that the afterlife is an unknown world that we cannot know, and it is a world that we can only imagine. Since not everyone has experienced the question of the afterlife, I think it's even more interesting to be able to freely express your own imagination."
1411,24,0,40,ENFP,31,<no>  I'd rather spend time alone than with other people. I think the reason is that I don't have time to be alone because I go to work early every morning and come home late and take care of my family.
1412,24,0,40,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I find principled stories boring. The reason seems to be because it always happens when I work at a development company. I've had a lot of theory-based discussions, but I don't think anything is more important than practice. I don't do original stories."
1413,24,0,40,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  I can easily empathize with people from different backgrounds. The reason is that I can't approach strangers easily under any circumstances, but as soon as I can talk to each other, I immediately change into an empathic type."
1414,24,0,40,ENFP,34,"<Yes>  tend to put off making decisions until the last minute. The reason is that you always have to be careful and careful when making many decisions. In order to prevent mistakes, I think I postpone the decision until the end in order to make it perfect."
1415,24,0,40,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  I don't rethink decisions I've already made. The reason is that the decision that has already been made is overturned, and I don't think it will change anything by reversing it. And it's because I think it's okay to just do what you've already decided on without making any mistakes."
1416,24,0,40,ENFP,36,"<no>  I prefer to spend time alone. The reason is that I go to work early every morning, leave work late, and take care of my family when I go home, so I don't have time to be alone. Therefore, it seems that the fatigue of the week will not go away with parties and events, but will be more aggravated. It's the same today."
1417,24,0,40,ENFP,37,<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. The reason is because I don't know much about art. I think going to art galleries and looking at art is a waste of time because I always think more and more about how to generate more income.
1418,24,0,40,ENFP,38,"<no>  I rarely have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. I think the reason is because I am very observant and considerate of others by my personality. For example, I ask my family and co-workers right away if they think it's even a little strange, and most of them were similar to what I thought."
1419,24,0,40,ENFP,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos. The reason is that when I have something to do, I unconditionally make a plan, make a schedule, and act according to the procedure or see the work. When I didn't plan what to do, there were always setbacks."
1420,24,0,40,ENFP,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. The reason is that I always feel anxious walking down the street, anxious when driving, anxious when working, and anxious about everything. Everything seems to come from safety and reliability. I'm walking down the street and I'm worried that a car is rushing to my location or that the wall in my house is cracked. It seems to be uneasy because I know about many cases."
1421,24,0,40,ENFP,41,"<Yes>  I try to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that the phone call is not directly seen and spoken, so it is highly suspected that my communication was not properly communicated. And I think it's not easy and annoying to talk on the phone."
1422,24,0,40,ENFP,42,<no>  don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from my own. The reason seems to be that I always arbitrarily decide my opinion and I don't try to understand or think about other opinions.
1423,24,0,40,ENFP,43,"<no>  I don't ask friends to meet up first. The reason is simple. Even if I don't call, my friends call to meet me. But now I've pretty much cut off contact. After I had a family, I gradually lost contact, but now I think it can be said that contact has been cut off."
1424,24,0,40,ENFP,44,"<Yes>  If my plans go wrong, I try my best to get back to them as quickly as possible. The reason was that at work, things that were supposed to be completed within the same time every day gradually became late. It was a misplacement of new personnel. At this time, after quickly grasping the situation and redeploying personnel as planned, the work was completed within the specified time."
1425,24,0,40,ENFP,45,"<Yes>  I regret a lot of my past mistakes. The reason seems to be ironing out as we get older one year older. As I vividly recall the actions I said and did in the past, I regret thinking about why I did those actions and words at that time."
1426,24,0,40,ENFP,46,"<no>  I tend to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. The reason is that from the moment children were born, they began to think about the reason for human existence and life. Now, what I often think about is what will happen to my children if I go to the other world, and I wonder if there is someone who will take care of my children more than me."
1427,24,0,40,ENFP,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions. Reasons include frequent fights at work. Even when there is a conflict with each other, rather than being swayed by emotions, I always try to persuade by talking about my disadvantages due to the company's bylaws."
1428,24,0,40,ENFP,48,"<no> If it is clear that it is the other person's fault, I will trample on the other person's face or anything. Even though the reason is the other person's fault, if there is no repentance or apology, it often makes it even more shameful."
1441,25,0,30,ENTJ,1,"<Yes>  I make new friends regularly. The reason is because of the nature of my job, I meet a lot of new people on a regular basis."
1442,25,0,30,ENTJ,2,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that I'm interested in working from home and side jobs these days, but I don't spend much time."
1443,25,0,30,ENTJ,3,<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that you only want to cry when you see someone crying for a family-related reason.
1444,25,0,30,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  As the saying goes, you always prepare a countermeasure because you need to prepare a countermeasure to put your mind at ease."
1445,25,0,30,ENTJ,5,"<neutrality>  The company is having a hard time, so I'm thinking about quitting and changing jobs, but on the other hand, I think things will get better."
1446,25,0,30,ENTJ,6,<neutrality> Neither is it uncomfortable to meet new people or meet old acquaintances.
1447,25,0,30,ENTJ,7,<no>  This is because the nature of the job and the company position require you to do multiple tasks at once.
1448,25,0,30,ENTJ,8,<no>  I think I'm a rational person because I hear more people say that I'm rational rather than emotional.
1449,25,0,30,ENTJ,9,<neutrality>  Planning with a schedule or list is situational and I prefer a diary.
1450,25,0,30,ENTJ,10,"<no>  know my own ability level, so I have never doubted my ability or knowledge."
1451,25,0,30,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  Because of the nature of my job, I often meet and talk to new people, so it's not difficult to approach and talk to people I'm interested in."
1452,25,0,30,ENTJ,12,"<Yes>  I have no interest in or knowledge about art, so I am not interested in discussing it."
1453,25,0,30,ENTJ,13,<Yes>  think I tend to follow reason rather than emotion because people around me say that I am cool-headed.
1454,25,0,30,ENTJ,14,"<neutrality>  Public affairs are planned, but personal time, such as holidays, is often improvised."
1455,25,0,30,ENTJ,15,"<Yes>  If you think you are proud of yourself when you are doing something, you are the tendency to act without paying attention to others."
1456,25,0,30,ENTJ,16,"<neutrality>  I enjoyed it before Corona, but now it's time, so I don't do group activities."
1457,25,0,30,ENTJ,17,"<no>  Rather than an open ending where you can interpret the ending in your own way, I think it suits me better to have a clear ending."
1458,25,0,30,ENTJ,18,"<neutrality>  I like to help others, but I don't do it by putting off all my own work."
1459,25,0,30,ENTJ,19,"<no>  There are so many interests, not so many interests that you're wondering what to do next."
1460,25,0,30,ENTJ,20,"<Yes> Recently, the field of work has been difficult due to corona, so I have a lot of worries. So, no matter what you do, worry first."
1461,25,0,30,ENTJ,21,<Yes>  I would like to avoid the leadership role as much as possible because I think the weight of responsibility that comes with being a leader is too much for me to bear.
1462,25,0,30,ENTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I don't have talent for making art, but I think I have talent for expressing myself through my body, such as performing on stage. I have often performed."
1463,25,0,30,ENTJ,23,"<neutrality>  I think rationality is more important than emotions in maintaining social order, but I think emotions cannot be ruled out in life."
1464,25,0,30,ENTJ,24,<no>  I think the efficiency of housework is higher after resting and replenishing your stamina.
1465,25,0,30,ENTJ,25,<Yes>  It's because I can see more people's different perspectives and thoughts.
1466,25,0,30,ENTJ,26,"<Yes> This is because if you attract a lot of attention from others, you may even receive unwanted hatred."
1467,25,0,30,ENTJ,27,"<no>  Because he is usually calm and cool-headed, his emotional ups and downs are not severe compared to others."
1468,25,0,30,ENTJ,28,<no>  I don't get annoyed when I see someone worse than me because each person has different skills based on their experience.
1469,25,0,30,ENTJ,29,"<Yes>  There are many cases of putting off work because of the feeling of working alone and the thought that no matter how much work you do, there is no end to it, and rather it builds up."
1470,25,0,30,ENTJ,30,<Yes>  I am curious because I am usually curious about other fields and it is a field that has not been scientifically proven.
1471,25,0,30,ENTJ,31,"<neutrality>  I usually like both meeting people and spending time alone, so it depends on the situation."
1472,25,0,30,ENTJ,32,<no>  I am interested in discussions because I like to talk with people. Not boring.
1473,25,0,30,ENTJ,33,"<Yes> Since I was young, I met many people of all ages and genders from all over the world and made friends, so my synesthesia ability improved a lot."
1474,25,0,30,ENTJ,34,<no>  I hate putting off making decisions until the last minute because it seems irresponsible.
1475,25,0,30,ENTJ,35,"<no>  I don't overturn a decision I made once, but I agonize a lot about whether it was a good decision or not."
1476,25,0,30,ENTJ,36,"<no>  After getting married, I spend more time with my family or alone than at parties."
1477,25,0,30,ENTJ,37,"<no>  Because I am not interested in art, I do not enjoy going to art galleries and art works."
1478,25,0,30,ENTJ,38,<neutrality>  There are times when I think it's a waste of time when I see the unnecessary emotional line going into it.
1479,25,0,30,ENTJ,39,"<neutrality>  I plan public work that needs to be done with others, but I tend to improvise personal work."
1480,25,0,30,ENTJ,40,"<neutrality> Originally, I didn't feel anxious, but as I had a family and my responsibilities increased, my anxiety began to increase."
1481,25,0,30,ENTJ,41,<no>  I never once thought about avoiding the phone because I don't feel uncomfortable talking to anyone.
1482,25,0,30,ENTJ,42,"<Yes>  I always live with the idea that I could be wrong, so I tend to listen to other people's positions and thoughts to the end."
1483,25,0,30,ENTJ,43,"<no> I'm not the type to contact my friends first. After having a family, the number of times I contacted my friends decreased significantly."
1484,25,0,30,ENTJ,44,<Yes>  This is especially true for work with time constraints. Because I don't want to shirk my responsibilities.
1485,25,0,30,ENTJ,45,<Yes>  I often think that I didn't make a good choice after seeing the business field that has become rapidly difficult due to Corona.
1486,25,0,30,ENTJ,46,"<Yes>  I'm not a philosophical person, so I tend not to think deeply about the above."
1487,25,0,30,ENTJ,47,"<no>  I'm the type to control my emotions well enough to be called cool-headed, so I'm not swayed by my emotions."
1488,25,0,30,ENTJ,48,"<Yes>  Even if the other party made a mistake, I don't think it's necessary to insult the character unless it's a crime."
1501,26,1,20,INFP,1,"<no>  I'm the shy type, and I'm more comfortable hanging out with friends I know."
1502,26,1,20,INFP,2,"<Yes>  have a lot of interest in clothes, so I look for new products from my favorite brands or shopping malls. I also like watching movies, so I often look for information or reviews on newly released movies."
1503,26,1,20,INFP,3,"<Yes>  Even if I don't feel sad right now, when I see the other person crying, I become assimilated with them and cry."
1504,26,1,20,INFP,4,"<Yes>  If things go wrong, I tend to do simulations in advance because I¡¯m afraid I won¡¯t be able to cope with it in panic. That's why I feel comfortable."
1505,26,1,20,INFP,5,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on the situation. There are times when mind control doesn't work. Lately, I don't think I've ever been in a particularly stressful situation."
1506,26,1,20,INFP,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk a lot with people I know. Approaching a new person first can be nerve-wracking, and I need to prepare my mind."
1507,26,1,20,INFP,7,"<no>  I tend to work on several projects at once. That way, you can proceed without getting bored."
1508,26,1,20,INFP,8,"<Yes>  often assimilate into other people's emotions, and when I watch a sad movie with my friends, I cry first."
1509,26,1,20,INFP,9,"<neutrality>  There are times when I write a plan on my phone at that time, and there are times when I don't even plan at all because it's annoying."
1510,26,1,20,INFP,10,"<Yes>  I recently discovered a mistake while handling work, and I blamed myself a lot at that time. Whether the size of the mistake is small or big, I tend to blame myself a lot."
1511,26,1,20,INFP,11,"<no>  think it's always been difficult. I had many worries ahead of me, such as what topics to talk about and whether I would make mistakes during the conversation."
1512,26,1,20,INFP,12,"<Yes>  I wonder what the discussion means because each individual feels differently about art. If you're curious about other interpretations, you can discuss it, but if not, I think your own interpretation is important."
1513,26,1,20,INFP,13,"<no>  want to be rational, but I think there are many cases where I am influenced by my emotions. My parents say that I am rational, but my friends around me evaluate me as emotional."
1514,26,1,20,INFP,14,"<Yes>  I like to be spontaneous. So, there are times when I make an appointment with a friend through KakaoTalk, and I have a lot of experience making travel appointments impromptu."
1515,26,1,20,INFP,15,"<Yes>  In the past, I was very conscious of other people's eyes, but I don't really care after realizing that others are like that, just like I'm not interested in others."
1516,26,1,20,INFP,16,"<no>  I do participate in group activities from time to time, but I don't enjoy it very much. These days, I often meet 1:1 with my friends."
1517,26,1,20,INFP,17,"<Yes>  I like it because it's interesting that each person feels differently about a piece of art. It's not recently, but I've had the experience of thinking deeply about the meaning and ending of a movie called The Wailing that I've seen before."
1518,26,1,20,INFP,18,<Yes>  think it's because I tend to feel the satisfaction of being helpful to others.
1519,26,1,20,INFP,19,"<Yes>  I had to work, watch YouTube, look at clothes, study, and had a lot of interests, so I was confused about what to do first."
1520,26,1,20,INFP,20,"<Yes>  After knowing that I make a lot of small mistakes myself, I tend to worry a lot about whether or not I made another mistake."
1521,26,1,20,INFP,21,"<Yes>  As a leader, there are many things to be responsible for, but it is very annoying and stressful to pay attention to these things."
1522,26,1,20,INFP,22,"<no>  I don't know if the way I think and express myself is unique, but I think it's because my friends told me that I have a sense and that I have a talent for art."
1523,26,1,20,INFP,23,"<neutrality> If people are rational, it would be nice if corruption due to nepotism would not occur, but I think it will be difficult to live in a harsh world. So I think we need a proper harmony."
1524,26,1,20,INFP,24,"<Yes>  If I take a break without doing all the housework, I think I will be stressed while thinking about what I have to do while resting. That¡¯s why I feel comfortable taking a break after completing my housework perfectly."
1525,26,1,20,INFP,25,"<no> When I see them arguing, I get nervous for no reason, and when I see people around me arguing because I get stressed out, I tend to stop or avoid the seat."
1526,26,1,20,INFP,26,"<neutrality>  I guess it varies from time to time. I don't know what standard it is, but sometimes I talk a lot because I want to get attention, but there are many cases where I stay still because the attention is burdensome."
1527,26,1,20,INFP,27,"<no>  I don¡¯t think I have a lot of emotional ups and downs. When set on a daily basis, it is maintained at almost the same tension."
1528,26,1,20,INFP,28,"<Yes>  Among the motives I worked on for each group, there was a motive for handling work inefficiently, but I had an annoying experience."
1529,26,1,20,INFP,29,"<Yes>  I need to make an appointment for a dental appointment, but I'm still not making an appointment because it's too much of a hassle."
1530,26,1,20,INFP,30,"<neutrality>  It's interesting, but I think it's annoying to start thinking about it because there are so many things to imagine."
1531,26,1,20,INFP,31,"<Yes>  used to be more comfortable being alone, but these days I spend a lot of time with friends."
1532,26,1,20,INFP,32,"<Yes>  Actually, I don't like the discussion itself, but I think the theoretical discussion would be even more boring."
1533,26,1,20,INFP,33,"<Yes>  When I was in high school, I regularly went to volunteer activities at the Senior Citizens' Welfare Center."
1534,26,1,20,INFP,34,"<Yes>  I have to think about making a decision, but the thought itself is so embarrassing and annoying that I tend to put it off until the end. After procrastinating and procrastinating, I make decisions with things like roulette or ladder climbing."
1535,26,1,20,INFP,35,"<no>  Even after making a decision, I often look back to see if this is the best. Rock Paper Scissors is also a three-year-old, but I'm worried that the outcome can be influenced by a single decision."
1536,26,1,20,INFP,36,"<Yes>  In the past, I always rested at home on the weekends, but these days I meet my friends every weekend and heal."
1537,26,1,20,INFP,37,"<Yes>  I feel a sense of wonder when I see a work of art, and I like that I can reflect on myself while thinking that there are really talented people in the world."
1538,26,1,20,INFP,38,"<Yes>  I've seen people who are deeply concerned about things that I would have passed on casually. At that time, I didn't understand."
1539,26,1,20,INFP,39,"<neutrality>  It feels good to make a plan, but most of the time things don't go according to plan, so there are many cases where we don't plan."
1540,26,1,20,INFP,40,"<neutrality>  I rarely feel anxious in my daily life, but I tend to feel anxious a lot when I am at work."
1541,26,1,20,INFP,41,"<Yes>  There are a lot of parts (voice, tone) that require more attention than writing text, and that in itself is annoying."
1542,26,1,20,INFP,42,"<no> When I hear someone else's opinion, I tend to accept it right away rather than trying to understand it."
1543,26,1,20,INFP,43,"<no>  I usually don't contact him first, so when a friend asks to meet me, I tend to meet him."
1544,26,1,20,INFP,44,"<Yes>  In the middle of my original job, I took on another job for a while, but I had an experience of quickly getting things done in order to return to my previous job."
1545,26,1,20,INFP,45,"<Yes> There was an experience that I deliberately chewed contact with my friends because it was annoying to meet them. I don't keep in touch with those friends now, but thinking about it now, I feel a bit regretful."
1546,26,1,20,INFP,46,"<Yes>  No matter what the current life is, I think it's natural to live because you were born. I don't like it because thinking deeply about a topic like this makes my head complicated."
1547,26,1,20,INFP,47,"<no> When I am swayed by my emotions, I think I am too weak, so I try to control myself. Maybe it's because I've adjusted well, people around me don't know how I'm feeling."
1548,26,1,20,INFP,48,"<neutrality>  While trying to save face, I tend to talk about the other person¡¯s bad points in a way that doesn¡¯t make them feel bad. It's important to soothe the emotions right now, but it's also important to figure out about the essential problem."
1561,27,0,40,INTP,1,"<no>  I am timid. The reason is that I have a timid personality, so I'm not the type to make new friends myself."
1562,27,0,40,INTP,2,<Yes>  I am interested in various things because I am in my 40s and it is difficult to change jobs and work that I can do separately. I am interested in business.
1563,27,0,40,INTP,3,"<Yes>  I am sentimental. The reason is that someone else is crying, or for some reason I want to cry, or tears come out."
1564,27,0,40,INTP,4,"<no>  am sentimental. The reason is that if something goes wrong, we do it right away on the spot. The reason is that even if you think about what to do in advance, you can't do it exactly, so if something goes wrong, you respond right away."
1565,27,0,40,INTP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to keep my composure. The reason is that the company has a lot of work, so there is no work pressure. What we are doing now is to make the equipment within the period. There are many cases where we make mistakes and work late at night because the delivery schedule is insufficient, but we adhere to the delivery schedule while working late at night."
1566,27,0,40,INTP,6,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to approach first. The reason is that I am introverted and timid, so it is inconvenient to talk before the people around me talk first."
1567,27,0,40,INTP,7,"<no>  I work on several projects at the same time because, due to the nature of my work, I am making several facilities and there are few employees."
1568,27,0,40,INTP,8,"<neutrality> I'm kind of neutral. The reason was sentimental, abstract, and lived without much thought. Depending on the situation, I work sentimentally or emotionally."
1569,27,0,40,INTP,9,"<no>  I hate making plans. The reason is that even if I make a plan or write a diary, I am not good at executing the work in a planned way, and I do the work in front of my eyes first."
1570,27,0,40,INTP,10,<no>  think mistakes are also a skill. The reason is that I made a facility and assembled it incorrectly and then reassembled it. I look at the drawing more closely and discuss the lacking part with the person in charge of design to reduce the next mistake.
1571,27,0,40,INTP,11,"<no>  I'm interested in people who are difficult at first. The reason is that even if I am interested, I am afraid to approach and have a conversation for the first time. It's because it's still difficult to know what to say."
1572,27,0,40,INTP,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in works of art. The reason is that at the age of 40, I am more interested in how to save more money to buy more snacks for children than art works."
1573,27,0,40,INTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. The reason is that my emotions are always changing and I don't have a firm idea, so I tend to think rationally. People around me often hear that I make rational decisions."
1574,27,0,40,INTP,14,"<Yes>  Due to the nature of my work, I work spontaneously. The reason is that the materials needed for equipment manufacturing have not been stocked on an accurate schedule, so work proceeds as soon as the materials arrive."
1575,27,0,40,INTP,15,<Yes>  I am important now. The reason is that other people evaluate me and don't worry about what kind of person I am. Who I am is what matters.
1576,27,0,40,INTP,16,"<no>  I hate group activities. The reason is that I feel stuffy when I meet a lot of people, and I don't like the feeling of being tied down somewhere when I do group activities."
1577,27,0,40,INTP,17,"<no>  The ending doesn't matter to me. Because I like all movies. Each genre comes with an ending I didn't think of, and I like it better."
1578,27,0,40,INTP,18,"<no>  feel satisfied when I am more successful. The reason is that if someone else succeeds, I feel more upset for some reason, and I feel greater satisfaction when I succeed and others succeed too."
1579,27,0,40,INTP,19,<no>  I don't have that many interests. The reason is that I'm not interested in it right now. I'm content with just having a good day.
1580,27,0,40,INTP,20,<Yes>  I tend to worry often. The reason is that I am worried about hearing unpleasant comments from team leaders and department heads due to disruptions in the delivery schedule after manufacturing the equipment.
1581,27,0,40,INTP,21,"<Yes>  I avoid the group leader role. The reason is that I don't like group activities, but if I take a more leadership role, I have to take more care of myself and put in more effort."
1582,27,0,40,INTP,22,"<Yes>  I don't think I have artistic inclinations. The reason is that I am not good at drawing, making, or doing anything artistic. I'm not good at just looking at assembly drawings, making them as they are, or drawing them."
1583,27,0,40,INTP,23,"<no>  I still think it's a good world. The reason is that if everyone lives with the same thoughts, etc., they are biased toward one place, repeating similar things with similar thoughts in the same daily life every day, so I think now is good."
1584,27,0,40,INTP,24,"<no>  don't mind if I don't finish my housework first before taking a break. The reason is that there's no problem at all if I take a break from work and do housework. No matter what I do first, I like it when I want to do it."
1585,27,0,40,INTP,25,"<no>  I hate arguing. The reason is that if there is no argument, it is best, I am not at the center of the argument, and if there is an argument, it is better to avoid it. I am afraid that I will go to the center of the controversy while looking at the controversy for nothing."
1586,27,0,40,INTP,26,"<Yes>  don't like the look around me. The reason is that when I have to attract other people's attention, I become more of a nuisance, and I feel comfortable doing my own work quietly."
1587,27,0,40,INTP,27,"<no>  My feelings don't change much because when I argue with someone or hear something I don't like, the feeling I hate lasts so long that I can't sleep at night, and even if something good happens, that feeling lasts for a long time."
1588,27,0,40,INTP,28,"<no> I'm not annoyed. The reason is that I'm not very efficient, and I can't always do everything efficiently, so if I get annoyed by others, I don't feel good when someone annoys me. Even if a subordinate makes work frustrating, that's his personality, and I've worked like that in the past.... He also judges that he can work efficiently later on, so I'm not that annoyed. Do it by giving a way."
1589,27,0,40,INTP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. The reason is that if there is a party or drinking party while manufacturing equipment, there are many cases where work is left behind and work is done the next day."
1590,27,0,40,INTP,30,"<Yes>  I am interested in the afterlife. The reason is that when I look at the afterlife, such as comics/webtoons, I often think that it would be nice to go to the afterlife later."
1591,27,0,40,INTP,31,"<no>  I like my alone time. The reason is that he has a timid personality, and he has a lot of work these days, so it's better to just watch movies/manga at home quietly by himself."
1592,27,0,40,INTP,32,"<Yes>  I think theory-based discussions are boring. The reason is that it is faster and more efficient to manufacture equipment with senior experience than to manufacture equipment based on theory. Theory-centered discussions only come out as theories, but if you proceed with the experience of seniors in the field, you can make the equipment more accurately."
1593,27,0,40,INTP,33,"<no>  I can't empathize with people from a different background than myself. The reason is similar to when a rich person asks a person without money why they live like that, and the person without money cannot sympathize with how rich people live like that."
1594,27,0,40,INTP,34,"<no>  think through my decision in advance. The reason is that you make a decision in advance and do it again if you think it is not. Even if you make a decision in advance, if the result is good, you think it is the correct answer."
1595,27,0,40,INTP,35,<no>  I tend to rethink decisions I have already made. The reason is that decisions can be changed at any time because decisions already made are not the answer to the consequences.
1596,27,0,40,INTP,36,"<no>  I hate parties. The reason is that I enjoy spending time alone. Watching movies alone, watching cartoons, and having fun at parties or events are more tiring."
1597,27,0,40,INTP,37,"<no>  I hate going to art galleries. I don't know anything about art, I just like to watch cartoons."
1598,27,0,40,INTP,38,"<Yes>  I'm not good at understanding other people's feelings. The reason is that I often don't know why employees are angry while working. We are talking in cooperation with each other, but there are many cases where we get angry and leave alone in the middle."
1599,27,0,40,INTP,39,"<no>  I like to work right in front of my eyes. The reason is that when planning something and the plan goes wrong, there are many times when I don't know what to do, so I just like to do the work in front of my eyes."
1600,27,0,40,INTP,40,"<Yes> There are many times when I don't feel uncomfortable. The reason is that there is little inconvenience while working and daily life. I don't know if it's a natural inclination or if it's changed over the course of my life, but I'm just living my life not feeling uncomfortable."
1601,27,0,40,INTP,41,<no>  I prefer the call. The reason is that it is more efficient to talk on the phone faster than texting a friend at work.
1602,27,0,40,INTP,42,"<no>  respect other people's opinions more. The reason is that if you think about my opinion and other people's opinions, that person's opinion can be better, and there is nothing wrong with doing that person's opinion first, so I put that person's opinion first."
1603,27,0,40,INTP,43,<Yes>  I don't contact you until we meet first. The reason is that I hate meeting people and enjoy spending time alone more. That's why I don't call to meet first.
1604,27,0,40,INTP,44,"<Yes> If my plan goes wrong, I go back to my plan. The reason is that if there is a problem with a part during equipment production, the person in charge of design and sales collaborates to change the part quickly and talks about delivery to revise the plan and proceed."
1605,27,0,40,INTP,45,<Yes>  I regret my mistakes a long time ago. The reason is that my relationship with people ends due to my mistake... I regret not being able to contact my friend due to my small mistake at a drinking party.
1606,27,0,40,INTP,46,<no>  don't think about human existence life. The reason is that I am thinking more deeply about how to live now.
1607,27,0,40,INTP,47,"<no>  I'm an introvert, so I'm good at controlling my emotions. The reason is that people around me ask me a lot when I don¡¯t know how I feel."
1608,27,0,40,INTP,48,"<Yes>  try to save the other person's face. The reason is that even if the other person does something wrong, I don't say it in front of a lot of people, but I tell them that I can do better next time. Because I never know when I'm going to do something wrong."
1621,28,1,40,INTJ,1,"<no>  I am comfortable with the people I am currently involved with. The reason is that I can be with you through hard times and good times, and it takes time to adapt when meeting new people."
1622,28,1,40,INTJ,2,"<neutrality> Rather than spending time, I naturally become interested in it on a daily basis. The reason is that I tend to explore accordingly, and recently I am very interested in health care."
1623,28,1,40,INTJ,3,"<neutrality>  I listen to the other person's difficult situation. I sympathize, but I don't cry when I see you crying. Because we act more rationally than emotionally."
1624,28,1,40,INTJ,4,<Yes>  I tend to think ahead and create alternatives in advance in case something goes wrong. That way you can get things sorted out.
1625,28,1,40,INTJ,5,"<Yes>  I was at the end of the month the day before yesterday, and while I was working, my laptop was infected with ransomware and I couldn't use the office program."
1626,28,1,40,INTJ,6,"<Yes>  When I attend a meeting, rather than approaching new people first, I tend to have a conversation with someone I already know, and when I am introduced to them, I tend to have a conversation."
1627,28,1,40,INTJ,7,"<neutrality>  I tend to work on multiple projects if the project is simple or short-term, and focus on long-term projects."
1628,28,1,40,INTJ,8,"<neutrality>  When I look back on myself, I prefer accurate and fast things when doing public work, and I am sentimental when it comes to private life, and I enjoy and enjoy my actions and life."
1629,28,1,40,INTJ,9,<Yes>  have a habit of making notes on my phone calendar function and desk calendar about new and periodic schedules.
1630,28,1,40,INTJ,10,<neutrality>  I find out the cause and find a method when my mistake slows down my work or I make mistakes for people.
1631,28,1,40,INTJ,11,"<neutrality>  I don't feel much difficulty in talking to someone I'm interested in meeting a new person with whom I was close, but I think about it in my heart beforehand and talk to the other person."
1632,28,1,40,INTJ,12,"<neutrality>  There are few opportunities to get close to art works, most of them are at home due to Corona, and when there is an opportunity, listen to the story and give feedback rather than leading a conversation with the person accompanying you."
1633,28,1,40,INTJ,13,"<neutrality> When I'm in trouble or difficult to deal with, I think about it, and I have a personality that moves my words and actions. For example, if children have a disagreement and quarrel or fight, they talk together to solve it, and when they enter each room, they listen to what they really think, empathize with them, and comfort them."
1634,28,1,40,INTJ,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to reduce reversal of things that I planned in advance, and when I want to do something spontaneously, I do it."
1635,28,1,40,INTJ,15,"<Yes>  want other people to see me as a good person and an upright person. It was in the second year of middle school that the part of thinking and acting became a personality, and when I was in an uncomfortable situation with a child in the same class, I thoughtlessly told that child that it was impossible to save. Later, I handed him a letter of apology and reconciled, but every word I said was difficult for him. After this, I became an adult and fixed it."
1636,28,1,40,INTJ,16,"<no>  I am not active in group activities, and I am a bit cautious about doing my work correctly, so I tend to enjoy home training even when it comes to exercise."
1637,28,1,40,INTJ,17,"<neutrality>  haven't seen a movie lately. Due to Corona, I usually stay at home, and I don't go to places where many people gather. When I saw an extreme job movie in the past, I thought it was comical but funny and sad. Although they are detectives, they fry chicken while working undercover, and find something they can do on their own, but solve the case. I have to work to live, and I have to find another job, and I have come to face reality. It was good to see her happy when the main character brought her a luxury bag and money, and to read aloud and support her family when she was having a hard time."
1638,28,1,40,INTJ,18,"<Yes> It makes me happy and happy to see people around me become calm, successful, and triumphant because of my help."
1639,28,1,40,INTJ,19,"<no>  When I have an interest, I tend to focus on that one thing, find it, suggest a method, and enlighten it."
1640,28,1,40,INTJ,20,"<no>  When things go wrong, I look for a way to deal with it and fix it by listening to the opinions of those around me. If you worry about things going wrong, you will be anxious about everything you do."
1641,28,1,40,INTJ,21,"<neutrality>  If I have to become someone's leader and teach, I will put in more effort and find out what I don't know, and give the right guidance to the person being taught."
1642,28,1,40,INTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I don't think I have any artistic inclinations at all. I like to sing, and I'm good at it."
1643,28,1,40,INTJ,23,"<neutrality>  For me, if emotions take precedence, there will be a lot of quarrels, and since I only insist on my position, I think half of the rational part is necessary."
1644,28,1,40,INTJ,24,"<Yes>  If there is something that needs to be done first, whether it is housework or outside work, it is easier to do it first. Because I want to get some rest."
1645,28,1,40,INTJ,25,<neutrality>  I like to listen and talk rather than enjoy looking at other people's arguments to see if they make sense.
1646,28,1,40,INTJ,26,"<neutrality>  I prefer to present myself rather than not attract attention, and I don't enjoy feeling stares. I've seen a lot of gossip when I get involved with too many people around me, and those parts don't fit."
1647,28,1,40,INTJ,27,"<no> Most of the time I like to even out my emotions and act. If I'm sick and my child doesn't hear me when I ask for a glass of water, I step closer and talk to them. I think it's right to approach rather than get angry in that area."
1648,28,1,40,INTJ,28,"<neutrality> When someone other than me does or says something that isn't effective, I suggest a way rather than correct it. For example, my eldest child is obese, so I adjust my diet, and when I eat rice, I tell my son to eat in this order. This will help him digest well and lose weight well. Water, vegetables/fruits, protein (meat, tofu, fish), carbohydrates (rice) It's good to eat,"" he says."
1649,28,1,40,INTJ,29,"<no>  I don't like to procrastinate, and I do what I can do in time."
1650,28,1,40,INTJ,30,"<no>  I never thought there was an afterlife, so I never found it interesting."
1651,28,1,40,INTJ,31,"<neutrality>  I enjoy spending time alone, and I also like being with people I know."
1652,28,1,40,INTJ,32,"<Yes>  think it's good to have a more specific and non-unidirectional discussion with the contents of the actual situation before there is a theory-centered discussion. As mentioned earlier, I told my child about eating habits when dieting, but it is important to tell them, but based on my actual experience, I think it will be more touching when I talk about what I have done or encountered."
1653,28,1,40,INTJ,33,<neutrality>  I think a consensus can be formed if there is a person in a similar environment or a slightly different but empathetic part.
1654,28,1,40,INTJ,34,"<neutrality> Decision times vary depending on the situation. Do what can be done right away without procrastinating, and if you have to leave a period, work according to that period."
1655,28,1,40,INTJ,35,"<neutrality>  Most people don't like to go over decisions they've already made, but if they're wrong or need to be improved, they'll reconsider and decide."
1656,28,1,40,INTJ,36,"<no>  I tend to enjoy spending time alone, and when I'm tired from the week, I watch TV shows I haven't seen on the weekend or take a nap."
1657,28,1,40,INTJ,37,"<Yes>  I remember going to the art museum a long time ago, but I am interested and like it because it is a historical part like a museum."
1658,28,1,40,INTJ,38,<no>  Don't be afraid or push away from understanding other people's feelings. Because I could be in the same situation.
1659,28,1,40,INTJ,39,"<no> Rather than planning every day, I check my schedule for recurrences and fit new things into my schedule. This way, there will be no entangled schedules. If you have free time, you can create other schedules."
1660,28,1,40,INTJ,40,"<no>  There are times when I feel anxious too, but when my family is sick or having a hard time, or when I can't find a way to cope with a blockage in my work, I remove my anxiety by talking with people around me."
1661,28,1,40,INTJ,41,"<neutrality>  think phone calls are different depending on the situation, but there is a difficult part when the other person says something that hurts or disparages me."
1662,28,1,40,INTJ,42,<no>  Even opinions that are very different from my own can be understood if the validity and reason are clear.
1663,28,1,40,INTJ,43,"<neutrality>  As for the part of contacting a friend to meet first, we think that we can contact each other according to each other's circumstances, so we discuss and set up a schedule."
1664,28,1,40,INTJ,44,"<no>  haven't had any problems with my plans lately. If it is judged that the future schedule is not important to the planned work, it will not be changed."
1665,28,1,40,INTJ,45,"<Yes> I've been working before my children were born, so I feel very sorry for not being able to be by their side when they grow up and grow up, especially when the first one is growing up. When I entered puberty, I was in 1st grade, but it was very difficult for each other to see the child's crooked appearance, and it took a long time to understand."
1666,28,1,40,INTJ,46,"<neutrality> Human beings form a family, and as a result, a child is born and becomes a family member, and we can live together in various forms of life, including happiness, sadness, and hardship. put meaning to The reason is because human beings are socially made to cooperate with each other."
1667,28,1,40,INTJ,47,<no>  I think it is important to think and act with rationality according to the situation rather than being swayed by emotions.
1668,28,1,40,INTJ,48,"<no> Since the other person's faults are visible and can be poisonous, I think it's better to give advice and help rather than save face."
1681,29,1,30,ENTP,1,"<Yes>  I like making new friends. When I meet a new friend, it's nice to hear the new story the friend has."
1682,29,1,30,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  I like to dig deep and find out. These days, I'm in the process of getting to know real estate for my move next year."
1683,29,1,30,ENTP,3,"<no>  I don't want to cry because others cry. I'm curious about why he cries, but I can't relate to his feelings, and I want to find out what caused him to be sad and solve it."
1684,29,1,30,ENTP,4,"<Yes>  I always have multiple contingency plans in place. Because there are various variables in living in the world, I don't think I will be able to reach the goal I want with just one countermeasure."
1685,29,1,30,ENTP,5,<Yes>  I try to keep my composure even when the pressure is severe. I don't think it's anything that can be swayed by emotions.
1686,29,1,30,ENTP,6,"<no>  I try to talk to new people as much as possible. Without an opportunity like this, you wouldn¡¯t be able to share various stories with new people."
1687,29,1,30,ENTP,7,"<no>  I tend to work on multiple projects. For me, who has a short attention span, it is difficult to completely complete only one project."
1688,29,1,30,ENTP,8,"<no>  I like to be analytical rather than sentimental. I think appreciation is something you feel with your heart, but I prefer to think rather than feel."
1689,29,1,30,ENTP,9,"<no>  I don't like making plans. Sometimes I try to make a plan with a schedule or list, but I can't keep it anyway, so I just think about it roughly and decide the order according to the situation."
1690,29,1,30,ENTP,10,"<no>  Everyone makes small mistakes, and I don't doubt myself over such small things. Recently, while studying for a certification, I kept getting wrong questions I knew by mistake. After seeing the problem roughly or only looking at the keywords and knowing that I made a mistake, I read the problem carefully, and I didn't repeat this mistake anymore. I think that anyone can make such a small mistake, and I think it is a problem that can be corrected."
1691,29,1,30,ENTP,11,<no>  It's easy for me to start a conversation by talking about something that interests me. Most of them became one with interests and shared many stories.
1692,29,1,30,ENTP,12,"<Yes> It's fun to discuss different interpretations of a work of art. After I realized that each person interprets a work of art differently, I became interested in hearing what other people think about this work. I like it because it makes me feel more open-minded when we talk."
1693,29,1,30,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  Emotionally, it's hard to draw an accurate conclusion, so I follow reason. Therefore, I think we should make judgments based on facts that can be objectively accepted by anyone who hears them. People around me usually gave the same evaluation based on objective standards."
1694,29,1,30,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  Improvisation is better. When things don't go as planned, you get stressed out. I like it because I don't get stressed if I improvise every time a variable appears."
1695,29,1,30,ENTP,15,"<no>  am proud of myself and believe in myself, so it doesn't matter how others see me. The reason I came to think this way is because of my experience of being hurt and stressed because I was easily swayed by others in the past."
1696,29,1,30,ENTP,16,"<Yes>  Participating in group activities is fun because you can hear the perspectives of various people. These days, I don't attend meetings because of Corona, but I'm active in the online community."
1697,29,1,30,ENTP,17,"<Yes>  I like works where you can think of different endings. It's fun because you can draw conclusions from various experiences depending on how you feel that day or whether you want to acquire more new information. Recently, I am re-watching Mr. Sunshine and watching it from the perspective of a supporting actor."
1698,29,1,30,ENTP,18,"<no> If you help others succeed, you're not doing your best. When I work for my success, I feel more satisfied overcoming difficult adversity."
1699,29,1,30,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  I often think about what to do among the many interests. I love watching movies, dramas, and reading books, but recently, when I suddenly had free time, I didn't know what to do, so I stomped my feet and thought about happiness."
1700,29,1,30,ENTP,20,"<no>  I am not good at worrying about work. Before I start worrying, I already work on things and carefully organize them, and I believe in myself that even if things go wrong, I will be able to solve them on my own. I think it's because there are always many times when things almost went wrong, and I am where I am today after overcoming countless adversities."
1701,29,1,30,ENTP,21,"<Yes>  I would rather play the role of a leader. In particular, I think that Korean people are passive, work sequentially, and often engage in desk discussions. I believe that if I become a leader, I will be able to quickly respond to crises and resolve the situation more wisely."
1702,29,1,30,ENTP,22,"<no>  don't have the ability to draw or compose myself, but I think enjoying them to the full is also an artistic inclination. I like to listen to music and go to art museums to infer the intentions of the artists."
1703,29,1,30,ENTP,23,"<Yes>  In Korea, I think that we are not good at making rational choices because we value academic ties, regional ties, and blood ties. If we cut off all ties and made a really rational decision, we would have a better society than we do now."
1704,29,1,30,ENTP,24,"<no>  I want to take a break first. First of all, I think it's okay to take a break, catch a breath, and then do housework. After all, housework will happen again."
1705,29,1,30,ENTP,25,"<Yes> It's fun to watch the debate. It's interesting to see from what position that person says that, from what position this person says this, and what to do to get the two of them to come to an agreement. It's like watching a sports game."
1706,29,1,30,ENTP,26,"<Yes>  I want to get other people's attention. I believe that I have my own personality and am good at innovative ideas. I want others to recognize my ability, so I want to draw attention to it."
1707,29,1,30,ENTP,27,"<no>  I try to keep my emotions as constant as possible. So, when emotions try to go down, we catch them and bring them back to their original state. For example, even if someone's words make you feel bad, think about why he said that from that person's point of view, try to understand, and if you still don't understand, just let it go and keep your composure."
1708,29,1,30,ENTP,28,"<Yes>  Efficiency comes from using a little more brain, but it is frustrating to see people who try to stick to the existing method. Mainly because my boss at work is a little older, the accidents stayed in the 90s, so I was annoyed that he didn't want to embrace the latest technology."
1709,29,1,30,ENTP,29,"<Yes> When you don't have the energy to work at all, or when it seems that no further progress will be made, you boldly postpone it until later. It is because I have had a lot of experiences when the light in my feet suddenly springs up and the things that have been blocked are released. Lately I've been trying to get it done before the day of the deadline."
1710,29,1,30,ENTP,30,"<Yes>  I think the afterlife is interesting. There are various theories about the afterlife, but since there is no objectively revealed bar, the strangeness doubles the curiosity."
1711,29,1,30,ENTP,31,"<neutrality>  I like to spend time with other people. It's because when I'm alone, I'm bored and I want to be with someone. Recently, face-to-face meeting is difficult due to corona, so I am spending time feeling a sense of belonging in the internet community."
1712,29,1,30,ENTP,32,"<no>  think the original story is important. There are various theories in the world, and I think learning a lot of those theories will help you live in the world. I want to know more about various theories because I had the experience of deepening my thoughts by sharing discussions."
1713,29,1,30,ENTP,33,"<no>  think it's harder to empathize with someone than you think. I can try my best to understand him, but in the end, I can't be him. Therefore, when a friend talks about their worries, I always listen with the premise that since I am not you, it is difficult to empathize as deeply as you."
1714,29,1,30,ENTP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone important decisions as much as possible. Because you're clumsy and not meticulous, it's hard to make decisions with certainty. Also, it's because you can't hold one thought for a long time with a long breath."
1715,29,1,30,ENTP,35,"<Yes>  Because I invested a long time to make a decision, I think it was a decision that I had already made after enough consideration, so I don't think about it again after making a decision."
1716,29,1,30,ENTP,36,"<Yes>  On weekends, I like to go to crowded places. It's because I had enough alone time during the week. Even now, I try to visit attractions in other areas on weekends as much as possible."
1717,29,1,30,ENTP,37,"<Yes>  I like going to art galleries and watching dramas and movies that are works of art. It's fun to understand the intention of the writer, and to understand the person's position as a character in the work."
1718,29,1,30,ENTP,38,"<Yes>  often find it difficult to understand other people's feelings. For example, when you find out about other people's hardships or emotional difficulties, you think of a way to overcome the situation, and you feel frustrated why you can't do that."
1719,29,1,30,ENTP,39,"<no>  I don't really make any specific plans. You make a to-do list every day, but you may or may not keep it. Because different things happen all the time. I tend to prioritize at that moment and do the important things first."
1720,29,1,30,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  I don't feel insecure. When I feel anxious, I think about ways to get out of the situation quickly. Since I learned in my childhood that great people wisely overcome uneasy situations, I try to think of ways to get out of this situation or ways to take advantage of it."
1721,29,1,30,ENTP,41,"<neutrality>  It depends on who you are talking to. I can talk about business or answer my questions without hesitation, but I want to avoid phone calls where I have to listen to others' detailed feelings. I don't agree with you, and it sounds a bit cold, but I want to spend that time thinking more productively."
1722,29,1,30,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  I also spend time with people who have completely different opinions. In my social life, it is difficult to meet someone who perfectly agrees with me. Therefore, when collaborating together, it is often necessary to understand the person's opinion."
1723,29,1,30,ENTP,43,"<Yes>  Compared to my friends, I have fewer appointments, so I tend to make an appointment to meet them first when the time is right."
1724,29,1,30,ENTP,44,"<no>  I'm not trying to go back to my old plan. It's because you have a few more alternatives in place before your plans are disrupted. Also, since the first plan has already been followed and there is a setback, I tend to bring out other alternatives and use them."
1725,29,1,30,ENTP,45,"<no>  often think of dark history before going to sleep, but I try not to regret it as much as possible. Because that choice would have been the best of my own at that moment."
1726,29,1,30,ENTP,46,"<no>  Thinking about the reason for living, I often fall into contemplation. In living this one life, I have an idea of how a person should live, and I want to live this life diligently."
1727,29,1,30,ENTP,47,"<no>  I tend to try not to be swayed by emotions. I think that when we get swayed by our emotions, we miss the objective nature of the problem. Therefore, emotions are always kept in high tension and in good condition for objective thinking. People who have seen me like this often hear that I think calmly and logically in any situation."
1728,29,1,30,ENTP,48,"<no>  It seems difficult to save face of others in this situation. I think it's for that person in the long run that the other person realizes their mistakes and changes. If you only think about the face of the other person at that moment, the other person will commit wrongdoing to many people without recognizing the wrongdoing as wrongdoing."
1741,30,1,30,ENFP,1,"<Yes>  make new friends regularly. The reason is that I like to do various activities outside rather than being alone at home. So naturally, I meet new people and make friends. I feel happier and more energized when I am with people than when I am alone. And because they don't feel uncomfortable meeting new people, they make friends easily. Since I have a lot of friends around me, I naturally become friends with my friends' friends."
1742,30,1,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  tend to spend a good portion of my free time exploring a variety of interests. These days, I am interested in sports like tennis and swimming. It's good for your health and exercise relieves stress."
1743,30,1,30,ENFP,3,"<Yes>  When I see someone else crying, I often want to cry myself. For example, even if you are watching TV, even if you do not know the content, you will often cry along if you see a crying scene. When I see sad people's faces, I feel sad and cry too."
1744,30,1,30,ENFP,4,"<no>  I don't think I'm the kind of person who has multiple plans in case things go wrong. I worry when something goes wrong, but I tend to think about it and come up with countermeasures after it actually happens."
1745,30,1,30,ENFP,5,"<no>  tend to have trouble maintaining my composure in high-pressure environments. For example, during a job interview, I was so nervous that I stuttered and trembled a lot. Also, when the deadline for a project approaches, it is not possible to finish it meticulously and there are many mistakes."
1746,30,1,30,ENFP,6,"<neutrality> At parties and events, I tend to talk to people I already know rather than introduce myself to new people first. However, if there is someone I want to get close to, I approach first and introduce myself. Because events and parties are opportunities to let me know or meet a lot of helpful people."
1747,30,1,30,ENFP,7,"<no>  I don't like to complete one project before starting another. Often, after starting not one but several things at the same time, you end up not finishing any of them."
1748,30,1,30,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  I am very sentimental. I have a lot of empathy for dramas and novels, and I tend to make decisions emotionally rather than rationally."
1749,30,1,30,ENFP,9,"<neutrality>  like to make plans with schedules or lists, but I'm not good at putting them into practice. I love making plans on my iPad, but I tend to only plan one month out of the year and forget about it. So these days, I'm trying to practice one plan a day."
1750,30,1,30,ENFP,10,"<Yes>  Even small mistakes often lead to doubts about one's abilities or knowledge. For example, when I talk to people about real estate or political current events, I feel a bit embarrassed when I get pointed out for telling wrong information."
1751,30,1,30,ENFP,11,"<Yes>  It's not that hard to reach out and strike up a conversation with someone you're interested in. If you start greeting with a smile at the beginning, you will greet anyone warmly, and if you talk a little bit, you can get to know the other person's personality. If you are passive and uncomfortable with strangers, adjust accordingly, and if you have the same tendency as me, you tend to get close quickly."
1752,30,1,30,ENFP,12,"<no>  I am interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. After reading a movie or book, I make sure to search for thoughts and interpretations that are different from mine. When I see people who think differently than me, I like the act of understanding the other person, saying, ¡°Oh, you can think like this.¡±"
1753,30,1,30,ENFP,13,"<no>  I tend to follow emotions rather than reason. When I think about it, I am a very emotional person, and people around me tend to think of me that way. Even when someone makes a mistake, I tend to think about how embarrassed and difficult that person is rather than the wrong situation."
1754,30,1,30,ENFP,14,"<neutrality>  In the past, I liked doing things spontaneously rather than planning a schedule for the day, and I still tend to do that. But now I am realizing the importance of planning as I feel the sense of accomplishment of making and achieving even a small plan."
1755,30,1,30,ENFP,15,<no>  tend to worry about who I look to others. I want to be well-received by the people around me and I want to be a good person. I want to be friendly with everyone without feeling alienated.
1756,30,1,30,ENFP,16,"<neutrality>  I like to participate in group activities, but these days, there aren't many such activities because of Corona, so I can't participate much these days."
1757,30,1,30,ENFP,17,"<Yes>  I tend to like books or movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. Recently, I felt it while watching a movie called 'Broker'. It is not clear what the content is trying to say, but it was a movie I watched while interpreting it in my own way, with the form of a family created in that new way and their emotions. Of course, all of my other friends who watched the movie gave bad reviews after seeing the movie."
1758,30,1,30,ENFP,18,"<no>  I don't get any greater satisfaction from helping others succeed than I do from my own. I like people, but I don't have a lot of interest. I want to help others because I'm successful, but I don't want to help others succeed."
1759,30,1,30,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  have so many interests that I often don't know what to do next. From my recent experience, I want to learn Japanese, but I also started because I thought I should finish English perfectly before Japanese. In the end, I started learning Japanese again because Japanese was more fun, and I also learned Chinese because I wanted to study Chinese while watching Chinese movies. I couldn't finish one like this, so I learned several languages."
1760,30,1,30,ENFP,20,"<no>  don't think I'm often worried that things might go wrong. Because I've never had such a bad experience, and I don't think anything can be solved by worrying in advance, so once I run into that situation, I tend to try to solve it only then."
1761,30,1,30,ENFP,21,"<Yes>  would like to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group as much as possible. Because I don't think I have strong leadership skills and I don't like taking on burdensome tasks. And I don't feel like I'm suited for a leadership role, as I sometimes resolve big decisions emotionally."
1762,30,1,30,ENFP,22,"<no>  I don't think I have very little artistic inclination. I like to sing and dance, and I also like to look at art. And many of my friends are also majoring in the arts."
1763,30,1,30,ENFP,23,"<no>  I don't think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. Policies that rationally say this would be good can be dissatisfied with someone, and in the end, they are relative, so I think we should sympathize with others."
1764,30,1,30,ENFP,24,"<no>  don't want to finish my chores before going to bed. Rather, I tend to finish my chores after taking enough rest. When I feel like taking a break, I think I need to rest."
1765,30,1,30,ENFP,25,<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. I don't like any controversy because I consider myself a pacifist.
1766,30,1,30,ENFP,26,<no> I'm not the type to avoid attracting other people's attention. It's because I like to get attention from people in a good way. But I hate avoiding it very much.
1767,30,1,30,ENFP,27,"<Yes>  My emotions tend to change very quickly. Even if you feel good right away, if you spend time alone for a long time, you will fall into your thoughts and become depressed."
1768,30,1,30,ENFP,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed with people who aren't as effective as I am. I'm not good at planning and making decisions, but since we couldn't make decisions together, there were many cases where I felt a bit frustrated even when I went on a trip."
1769,30,1,30,ENFP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. I'm always on the verge of rushing to meet deadlines. Recently, I'm trying to live a planned life, so it seems to be getting better."
1770,30,1,30,ENFP,30,<Yes>  I think the question of the afterlife is interesting. Because I'm also interested in religion and it's interesting to imagine a world nobody knows about.
1771,30,1,30,ENFP,31,"<Yes>  I prefer to spend time with others rather than alone. But these days, I have a lot of time to be alone because of Corona, so I can enjoy the time alone differently."
1772,30,1,30,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in theory-based discussions, and I tend to find principled stories boring. I'm interested in free discussions with open endings, but I don't seem to be able to participate well in theoretical discussions."
1773,30,1,30,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  can easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds than mine. I tend to try to understand that if I knew the background of my life, I would be able to do these actions and thoughts based on that background."
1774,30,1,30,ENFP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to put off making decisions until the last minute. Especially when it comes to important things, I tend not to make a decision until the pressure comes, and only then do I make a decision when the deadline is running out."
1775,30,1,30,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  tend not to reconsider decisions I have already made. It's something I've already decided on, so I tend not to think twice about it."
1776,30,1,30,ENFP,36,"<Yes>  Rather than spending time alone, I tend to relieve my fatigue from the week with a fun party or event. If you hang out with people on the weekend, you can spend the next week happily. But these days, I often travel alone."
1777,30,1,30,ENFP,37,"<Yes>  I like going to art galleries and looking at works of art. Originally, I wasn't interested in it, but I recently had an opportunity to study art, and I was interested in various interpretations."
1778,30,1,30,ENFP,38,<no>  I don't often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. I tend to try to understand the other person's feelings a lot in what kind of situation I felt.
1779,30,1,30,ENFP,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos. I like to plan work rather than personal things, and when I make a long-term plan like a week or a month, I often can't fulfill it, so I like to set it up every day."
1780,30,1,30,ENFP,40,"<no>  often feel insecure. Originally, I had never felt so anxious, but after a certain person, I experienced that I couldn't sleep well at night because of that person, my appetite decreased, and my heart raced because of anxiety."
1781,30,1,30,ENFP,41,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. Since I was young, I have not been good at ordering food over the phone, and I tend to think a lot before making a necessary phone call. I think the reason is because I'm a little worried that the other person might feel uncomfortable answering the phone right now."
1782,30,1,30,ENFP,42,"<Yes>  I tend to spend a lot of time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. For example, I was curious about how people think differently about the same topic depending on their MBTI inclinations. My friend has the opposite tendency to me, so I tried to understand him by looking up the MBTI for his personality."
1783,30,1,30,ENFP,43,"<no> I'm not the type to contact my friends to meet up first. Lately, I've been getting calls from friends asking me to meet them first."
1784,30,1,30,ENFP,44,"<no>  When my plans go wrong, I'm not the type to try to get back to them as quickly as possible. If there is a setback in my plan, I tend to improvise by changing my plan."
1785,30,1,30,ENFP,45,"<no> There aren't many times to regret old mistakes. I tend to fix things and mistakes that happened in the past, and try not to think about the past in the present."
1786,30,1,30,ENFP,46,"<neutrality>  I tend to think a little about human existence and the reason for living. We believe that there is a reason for our existence, and we believe that everyone's ties are predestined and precious."
1787,30,1,30,ENFP,47,"<Yes>  tend to be swayed by my emotions rather than controlling them. But these days, I'm trying to control my emotions well. I meditate or read books to control my emotions."
1788,30,1,30,ENFP,48,"<Yes>  I try to save the other person's face even when it's obvious that it's their fault. This isn't the case in all situations, but when my boss does something wrong to me, for example, I try to save face as carefully as possible. Because you think it's dory."
1801,31,1,30,ESTP,1,<Yes>  It's fun to get to know and get to know new people in everyday life. That's how you make new friends.
1802,31,1,30,ESTP,2,"<Yes> Interests that I am interested in change from time to time, and once I have an interest, I dig deep. These days, I have a lot of interest in N jobs. I keep thinking about what I like, what I am good at, and what I can do with it. People who are already doing various things are learning what they are doing by reading books and watching YouTube."
1803,31,1,30,ESTP,3,"<no>  To be honest, I don't like seeing people cry right in front of me. It's so painful that the other person cries. There are times when I can sympathize with the story, but I don't know how to deal with someone crying in front of me."
1804,31,1,30,ESTP,4,"<Yes>  When I do something, I always think of the worst that could happen. I start working after thinking about how to deal with the worst situation."
1805,31,1,30,ESTP,5,"<neutrality> It's painful when I feel like I'm being chased too much or someone is following me. However, I think my concentration gets stronger in that situation. So, I try to complete the given task within the specified period. It's a situation that I hate very much, but I express it as neutral because I don't run away and do it until the end."
1806,31,1,30,ESTP,6,"<Yes>  don't hate meeting new people, but I always have time to observe and explore by myself when I'm meeting someone for the first time. So when I see someone new, I think I tend to approach people I already know rather than approaching them first."
1807,31,1,30,ESTP,7,"<neutrality> Rather than finishing one project and starting another, I do several things at the same time. However, rather than expressing myself as doing a little of this and a little of that, I set some standards I set for myself, and when I think I've met the standards, I start another project. It seems that doing so is less tiring and more focused and efficient compared to the same amount of time."
1808,31,1,30,ESTP,8,"<no>  I think the question itself is a different story from me. Because it is not, no specific experience comes to mind."
1809,31,1,30,ESTP,9,"<no>  don't like it. Looking at something full of plans is rather stressful. And even if you make a plan, the plan is easily changed."
1810,31,1,30,ESTP,10,<no>  I don't doubt my ability or knowledge with small mistakes. I think everyone can make mistakes.
1811,31,1,30,ESTP,11,<Yes>  Being interested means having something in common or interests with me in some way. That's why it's easy to start a conversation if you talk about that commonality or interest.
1812,31,1,30,ESTP,12,<no>  Works of art seem ambiguous. It is boring and uninteresting to me to think about interpretations that are not revealed openly.
1813,31,1,30,ESTP,13,"<neutrality>  It seems different from time to time. If the heart rising emotionally is strong enough to suppress reason, make an emotional decision, and if you hate it emotionally but the degree is weak, judge it rationally."
1814,31,1,30,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  It seems that my condition, curiosity, and interests change day by day. I feel happier when I wake up in the morning and can spend the day following what I want to do and what interests come to mind."
1815,31,1,30,ESTP,15,"<no> Other people are other people, and I think I am. It would be painful if someone hated me, but basically, I live my life and think that others are living other people's lives. I don't think I can live my life independently if I'm afraid of how others see me."
1816,31,1,30,ESTP,16,"<no>  They seem to enjoy participating independently rather than participating in group activities. Rather than listening to everyone's opinions and finding satisfactory answers in group assignments, it's easier for me to digest many parts myself."
1817,31,1,30,ESTP,17,"<no>  I don't like vagueness. If the ending is ambiguous, rather than thinking for myself, I look at this and find out how others have interpreted the ending, and it seems that I sympathize with the part that I agree with and I do not agree with the part that I do not. and it ends"
1818,31,1,30,ESTP,18,"<no>  get a lot more satisfaction from doing my job successfully than from helping others. I don't want to make sacrifices that I can't see behind someone's back, and I'm not proud of it."
1819,31,1,30,ESTP,19,"<no>  When something interests me, I tend to fall in love with it for a while. And when you feel that you have found out about this interest to your satisfaction, it seems that a new interest arises out of it. At the moment when you are immersed in one thing, other interests are not in the eyes."
1820,31,1,30,ESTP,20,"<neutrality>  When I'm working, I think of the worst situation and think about my solution at this time to some extent. That's why when I actually started working, I didn't go to the worst situation I thought, so I think I can deal with unexpected situations more flexibly."
1821,31,1,30,ESTP,21,"<neutrality>  can if I have to. But I don't want to go ahead and say that I want to be a leader. If a group does not have a specific leader, they often assume the role of leader themselves. However, the title of leader itself seems burdensome."
1822,31,1,30,ESTP,22,<Yes>  It is difficult to imagine something and make it a reality. That is why it is difficult to sympathize with works of art in which someone's imagination is expressed in reality.
1823,31,1,30,ESTP,23,<no>  I think the world is turning because rational people and emotional people live together.
1824,31,1,30,ESTP,24,"<no>  It depends on my condition at that time. Some days I prefer to do all the housework and rest comfortably, and some days I put off all the housework and start resting."
1825,31,1,30,ESTP,25,"<no>  Looking at other people's arguments, I want to express my opinions and thoughts too. It's not that I hate controversy, but I don't like having to look at it unilaterally."
1826,31,1,30,ESTP,26,"<no>  I don't want to draw anyone's attention, nor do I want to avoid it. What other people think of me is not a reason for swaying my actions."
1827,31,1,30,ESTP,27,"<neutrality>  I do not know. There must be such a reason why my emotions change, and if I am in a situation where my emotions have no choice but to change quickly, it will be, otherwise it will not."
1828,31,1,30,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  If you create a situation that you wouldn't have to go through if you thought about it a little, and see you worrying about it in that situation, I get annoyed thinking 'Who would do that?', 'Why did he do that?'"
1829,31,1,30,ESTP,29,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it is, sometimes it is right. It depends on the condition of the day. But these days, it seems that there are more days where I do what I have to do first."
1830,31,1,30,ESTP,30,<no>  The afterlife is an unknowable problem no matter how much you think about it. I don't think I'm more interested in it because it's an unknown world.
1831,31,1,30,ESTP,31,"<Yes>  When I'm alone, I'm bored, so I call someone. It's more fun to meet and talk with someone than to be alone."
1832,31,1,30,ESTP,32,"<no>  It's not that I'm not particularly interested in it because it's a theory-centered discussion, but I like the discussion itself where I share my thoughts and opinions with someone."
1833,31,1,30,ESTP,33,"<Yes>  I can easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds. So, there are people of various classes around me. There are people around me who are really good at studying and have a successful position, and people who haven't graduated from high school and are living a rough life, and I can sympathize with their lives."
1834,31,1,30,ESTP,34,"<no> If I have to make a decision, I make it rather quickly. The longer the worry, the more painful it is and the more difficult it is to come up with an answer."
1835,31,1,30,ESTP,35,"<neutrality>  To be honest, I do think, 'I wish I had made this decision at that time.' However, because of that, the present me is not suffering as an enemy of misfortune. so it is neutral"
1836,31,1,30,ESTP,36,"<neutrality>  don't know. Participating in fun parties and events is fun and energizing. However, sometimes I get energy by lying down and resting by myself without doing anything."
1837,31,1,30,ESTP,37,"<no>  I am not interested in works of art. Even when I look at the picture, I don't feel any particular emotion. If you see a work that is delicately the same as the real thing, like a photograph, it is strange in itself."
1838,31,1,30,ESTP,38,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I understand, sometimes I don't. If I am empathetic, I can understand your feelings. However, if you feel that it was a stupid choice in the first place, it is difficult to sympathize with the person's difficult and painful feelings. I think it's like self-employment"
1839,31,1,30,ESTP,39,"<no>  I don't like to spend my day according to a given plan. I prioritize the things to do today in the order I want to do them, and that is the most efficient."
1840,31,1,30,ESTP,40,"<no>  I don't feel anxious for no reason, and I'm not in an environment where I feel particularly anxious."
1841,31,1,30,ESTP,41,<no>  I like to talk on the phone. It is much more convenient and better to make a phone call that allows you to communicate directly than text messages such as KakaoTalk.
1842,31,1,30,ESTP,42,"<no> If there is an opinion that is very different from mine, I tend to try to persuade it. However, if the other person's opinion is also strong, that person is that person and I am me, so I just think separately."
1843,31,1,30,ESTP,43,"<Yes>  I contact them and meet them, but more often than not, I contact them to ask to meet first."
1844,31,1,30,ESTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, rather than quickly returning to the plan, we think about what is the best solution and how to cope with the current situation with a setback."
1845,31,1,30,ESTP,45,<no>  The mistakes of a long time ago are problems that I can't do anything about now. It's not a good idea to spend time and emotions on regrets because regrets won't change anything.
1846,31,1,30,ESTP,46,"<neutrality>  I wasn't interested at all. However, after the corona exploded, the time to meet people was reduced, and it became a concern for a while. Now I'm out of that interest again. So I guess I can't say no at all."
1847,31,1,30,ESTP,47,"<Yes>  I think you should be able to control your emotions well. However, it seems to be difficult and difficult to control all my emotions as much as my thoughts."
1848,31,1,30,ESTP,48,"<no>  When the fault of the other person is obvious, I think the other person needs to know it himself."
1861,32,1,40,ISFP,1,"<no>  I like to forge new relationships with existing friends, and when I make new connections, anxiety and stress appear."
1862,32,1,40,ISFP,2,"<Yes>  I have a lot of curiosity, so I like to spend time baking at home, making hairpins, and making natural cosmetics, and learning and learning something new interests appear every now and then."
1863,32,1,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  I am very emotional and assimilate and absorb other people's emotions well, so when the other person cries, I often cry too."
1864,32,1,40,ISFP,4,"<neutrality>  Before I go on a trip, I tend to plan and prepare meticulously. However, when I go on a trip, I don't go according to plan, I plan the place I want to go at that time and prepare accordingly."
1865,32,1,40,ISFP,5,"<no>  I don't adapt well to stressful environments, I get very stressed, I lack the willpower to overcome, and I complain a lot."
1866,32,1,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I do not adapt well to unfamiliar environments, I am weak in making new relationships, and I rely on people I already know to talk."
1867,32,1,40,ISFP,7,"<neutrality>  I guess I'm different from time to time. I finish a very important project and do other things, but there are times when I do things that I really want to do or need to do at the same time."
1868,32,1,40,ISFP,8,"<Yes>  I am irrational and very sentimental. Even if you look at the sea, you are immersed in sentimentality and like to think, and you have a lot of lingering feelings or regrets about the past."
1869,32,1,40,ISFP,9,<no>  I am very bothered by writing a diary and I am very stressed about making plans.
1870,32,1,40,ISFP,10,"<Yes>  I have low self-esteem, so I blame myself for even the smallest mistakes and lower myself. For example, my boss asked me to copy the paper, but the paper was printed on the contrary, so I made a mistake. I tend to blame myself very much."
1871,32,1,40,ISFP,11,"<no>  I'm shy and if there's someone I'm interested in, I try to avoid them and hide my true feelings."
1872,32,1,40,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in works of art, and discussing them gives me headaches. Even looking at the world-famous Picasso's art works, there is no inspiration."
1873,32,1,40,ISFP,13,"<no>  I am very emotional. When something happened, we couldn't rationally judge it, so we often get frustrated and make a lot of mistakes. When my child is hurt, I can't see it rationally, and I get angry and scold."
1874,32,1,40,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  I get a lot of stress from planning and I like and enjoy doing what I want to do at the time, indecisively and slowly."
1875,32,1,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  I am very sensitive to the evaluation of others and I am easily hurt. If you say a word in passing, there are times when you think about it all day, and there are times when you feel bad."
1876,32,1,40,ISFP,16,"<no>  I enjoy working alone rather than working in a group and feel rewarded. In group activities, I am not happy because I do not have my presence."
1877,32,1,40,ISFP,17,"<Yes>  I like books and movies with multiple endings rather than one-size-fits-all interpretations. When you watch the movie Your Wedding, it's a story about first love coming true, but I liked it because it felt like breaking common sense."
1878,32,1,40,ISFP,18,"<Yes>  Happiness comes from helping others, my self-esteem goes up, and I feel alive."
1879,32,1,40,ISFP,19,"<neutrality>  I have a lot of interests, but I always find something to do and do it well. Today is the day to cook, and today is the day to clean."
1880,32,1,40,ISFP,20,<Yes>  am very worried that what I have done will not come true and will go wrong. There have always been mistakes and I have a lot of worries because things don't go as planned.
1881,32,1,40,ISFP,21,<Yes>  I want to avoid being stressed out when it comes to stressful work. The pressure to do well is hard.
1882,32,1,40,ISFP,22,"<no>  I have artistic inclinations. I like to draw, learn yoga, and even have a yoga instructor certification."
1883,32,1,40,ISFP,23,<neutrality>  I am considered neutral. I think it will be a better world if we value emotions in some ways and think rationally in others. I think you'll have a problem if you focus on one side only.
1884,32,1,40,ISFP,24,"<no>  After taking a break, I tend to start doing housework with time to recharge. After enjoying a quiet cup of coffee, I go to work."
1885,32,1,40,ISFP,25,"<no>  I hate disputes and arguments. It is difficult to mediate when trouble arises, and I value peace and feel stable."
1886,32,1,40,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  I don't like to be in the spotlight and I want to be buried in plain sight. Even if I wear clothes, I like clothes that are simple and don't stand out."
1887,32,1,40,ISFP,27,"<Yes> My emotions change from moment to moment and I am very emotional. Even if I feel good when my husband kisses me, I get angry again when I see him lying down and using his cell phone."
1888,32,1,40,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  I tend to stick to things, so I prefer to do something for a better future than sit still. I get angry when I see people idling around doing nothing."
1889,32,1,40,ISFP,29,"<Yes> When I feel pressured and stressed, I often avoid doing it as much as I can and put it off until the end. Even when I submitted a report, I procrastinated and procrastinated, and I was the last to submit it."
1890,32,1,40,ISFP,30,<no>  I don't want to worry about it now because I'm not interested in the afterlife and what happens after I die.
1891,32,1,40,ISFP,31,"<no>  Because I spend my time well when I am alone, I have no time to be bored, and I feel comfortable being alone because I do not have any stress from human relationships."
1892,32,1,40,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  was bored during discussions, often fell asleep, and I wasn't interested. I don't care about the news and I think it's boring."
1893,32,1,40,ISFP,33,"<Yes>  I'm someone I've never seen, but I can relate to and absorb easily. When I saw a news article about a mother who lost her son, I cried like tomorrow."
1894,32,1,40,ISFP,34,<no>  They are good at making ends meet when making decisions. Make decisions quickly rather than pondering over and over again.
1895,32,1,40,ISFP,35,<Yes>  try not to regret as much as possible about the decision I made and I do not have regrets.
1896,32,1,40,ISFP,36,"<<No>  Since I am always with my children, alone time is more important and I have time to relieve fatigue."
1897,32,1,40,ISFP,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. Even if I don't go looking for it, I don't want to go even if I ask to go."
1898,32,1,40,ISFP,38,"<no>  try to understand other people's feelings as much as possible, and I try to go along even when I disagree."
1899,32,1,40,ISFP,39,"<Yes>  I hold a big boundary and practice what I have to do today. For example, today I think specifically about making chives kimchi and put it into practice."
1900,32,1,40,ISFP,40,"<no>  I often feel anxious, especially in the dark of the night, and I feel anxious and scared. I can't sleep well when my husband is working overtime."
1901,32,1,40,ISFP,41,<Yes>  I prefer texting rather than talking on the phone and it puts me at ease. Talking on the phone can make you nervous and say things you shouldn't.
1902,32,1,40,ISFP,42,"<no>  I try not to think about stressful things as much as possible, and if I have a different opinion, I try not to look closely and not think about it."
1903,32,1,40,ISFP,43,"<no>  don't call my friends first and don't call them. If you refuse when I ask to meet you, your mentality is weak enough to get hurt."
1904,32,1,40,ISFP,44,<Yes>  I went to the mart and left the stroller on my way home. I immediately contacted the mart and asked them to keep it.
1905,32,1,40,ISFP,45,"<Yes>  I have a lot of lingering attachments to the past and a lot of regrets. I have given up after failing my cooking and baking license twice, but I think I should try one more time."
1906,32,1,40,ISFP,46,"<Yes>  I have never thought about human existence and the reason for living itself, and I am not interested at all. It's because if you think too deeply, your head hurts and you can't come up with an answer."
1907,32,1,40,ISFP,47,"<Yes>  I am easily swayed by my emotions, so there are many times when I cry and laugh at the words of the other person, and I often get so angry that my face turns red because it is difficult to control my emotions. I hear that it is like manic depression because it is difficult to control emotions."
1908,32,1,40,ISFP,48,"<no>  I often criticize the other person when it is clear that it is their fault. When the other person is using the toilet and urine splashes on the toilet, I tend to ask them to clean the toilet right away."
1921,33,0,40,ISFP,1,<no>  I don't feel like making new friends. It is best to rest at home after work.
1922,33,0,40,ISFP,2,"<Yes>  These days, I'm interested in acquiring a certification, so I'm looking for a certification that meets my conditions among many certifications. Among them, I am interested in a loss appraiser and am looking into it."
1923,33,0,40,ISFP,3,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the situation. When actors in a movie or drama are crying in a sad situation, I want to cry too, but in real life, when someone is crying, I only comfort them, but I don't feel like crying."
1924,33,0,40,ISFP,4,"<no>  I don't tend to prepare in advance. When things go wrong, I tend to deal with them according to the situation."
1925,33,0,40,ISFP,5,"<no>  I try to keep my composure in a high-pressure environment, but I don't seem to be a pig easily. Not long ago, I had an interview for a new job, and it took me a long time to think about the answer to the question because I was under a lot of pressure."
1926,33,0,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I like to talk to people I know. I don't think I'm the first to think that if I introduce myself to someone new, they might see me badly."
1927,33,0,40,ISFP,7,"<no>  Rather than completely finishing one project, I tend to work on two or three projects together and organize the projects that can be sorted out first."
1928,33,0,40,ISFP,8,"<no>  It seems more realistic than sentimental. Rather than turning around and thinking, it seems to think about what it looks like."
1929,33,0,40,ISFP,9,<no>  Schedules are rarely planned in advance. Do what you need for the day and write down only the things you don't want to forget on the calendar.
1930,33,0,40,ISFP,10,<Yes> There have been times when you have thought that your ability is incompetent due to a small mistake. There was a time when there was a difference between the computer inventory and the actual inventory because the company counted the number of inventory incorrectly.
1931,33,0,40,ISFP,11,"<no>  Even if you're interested in someone, you find it really difficult to approach them first and start a conversation. It is not easy to approach if you think that the other person is uncomfortable or looks at you badly."
1932,33,0,40,ISFP,12,<Yes>  am not very interested in interpreting and discussing works of art. I'm not the type to be very inspired by a work of art.
1933,33,0,40,ISFP,13,<no>  I tend to follow emotions more than reason. There were times when people around me told me not to act too emotionally.
1934,33,0,40,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  It is often improvised rather than scheduled. Occasionally, I went for an unplanned drive after work to see the sea."
1935,33,0,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  I am very curious and concerned about how others see me. I don't know why, but someone else cares."
1936,33,0,40,ISFP,16,"<no>  I rarely participate in group activities. Even in the company, I try not to attend company dinners. I'm fine with two or three people, but I don't like a lot of people."
1937,33,0,40,ISFP,17,"<no>  I like books and movies with a definite ending. It's not a recent movie, but I like things that have a definite ending like Mr. Man."
1938,33,0,40,ISFP,18,"<neutrality>  In the past, I thought it was better to help others succeed, but now I think my success is more important, so I'm trying to do that."
1939,33,0,40,ISFP,19,"<Yes>  have a lot of interests these days, so I'm thinking about what to do. These days, I want to get a license, but I'm thinking about which one to get."
1940,33,0,40,ISFP,20,<Yes>  I get a little negative and worry that things might go wrong. There seems to be no reason or cause.
1941,33,0,40,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  would like to avoid leadership or leadership roles if at all possible. I used to be active in athletics when I was in middle school. At that time, I played the role of captain, but there was a lot of fatigue and pressure, so I have been avoiding the role of leader since then."
1942,33,0,40,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  I don't think I have artistic inclinations. When I was in school, I had a hard time keeping up with my art classes."
1943,33,0,40,ISFP,23,"<no>  If reason is more important than emotion, it will be a good world, but it will feel cold, and a world that values emotions will become a warmer world."
1944,33,0,40,ISFP,24,<no>  It seems that I often take a break first and then do housework. I tend to procrastinate.
1945,33,0,40,ISFP,25,"<no>  I don't like to see them arguing with each other. We try to convince each other, but we usually only talk about each other's opinions and don't listen to the other person's story. It's so frustrating that we hate watching."
1946,33,0,40,ISFP,26,<Yes>  try not to attract other people's attention. I tend to follow the mood rather than lead it.
1947,33,0,40,ISFP,27,"<no>  Emotions don't change quickly. I'm not very angry. First of all, I tend to organize things internally and express my feelings."
1948,33,0,40,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  I don't think I'm efficient myself, but when I see people like that, it looks really hard. I sighed when I saw a junior who had just joined the company complicate something that could have been done simply."
1949,33,0,40,ISFP,29,"<Yes>  There are many cases where you put off what you have to do until the end. Recently, the company representative asked me to make a process table for the factory, but I dragged out the time and the CEO told me to complete it by tomorrow, so I made a process table and reported it by the next day."
1950,33,0,40,ISFP,30,"<no>  don't find stories about the afterlife interesting. I don't think it's certain because the afterlife is something you can experience after you die, and you can't talk about that experience because you're dead."
1951,33,0,40,ISFP,31,"<no>  I would rather spend time alone than with others. I like to spend time alone because I feel awkward when I am with other people, even if I am close with them."
1952,33,0,40,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  I think original stories are boring. Even when I listen to lectures, it is difficult to concentrate on classes that are only based on theories."
1953,33,0,40,ISFP,33,<Yes>  I think I can empathize with other people even if they tell stories from a different background than me. I was able to empathize with the thought that it might be possible if that person just acknowledged something else.
1954,33,0,40,ISFP,34,"<no>  When faced with a decision to make, rather than delay it, make a decision and act on it."
1955,33,0,40,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  You don't give second thought to decisions you've already made. It's just that if something goes wrong, you'll have some regrets, but you won't think about it again."
1956,33,0,40,ISFP,36,"<no>  Rather than attending a party or event, I spend time alone and relax by doing nothing."
1957,33,0,40,ISFP,37,<no>  don't really like going to art galleries. I don't appreciate art because I don't know much about art or art.
1958,33,0,40,ISFP,38,<no>  I think I understand other people's feelings very well. I think I can understand why that person is angry or depressed because I just accept that person.
1959,33,0,40,ISFP,39,<no>  I don't plan on doing things every day. I don't like scheduling because it bothers me.
1960,33,0,40,ISFP,40,"<neutrality>  I often feel anxious, but it doesn't last long. There was no particular reason, and it seems that the tendency is like that."
1961,33,0,40,ISFP,41,<Yes>  I have a hard time making phone calls first. I don't know why otherwise. It's just hard to call.
1962,33,0,40,ISFP,42,<no>  I don't take the time to understand opinions that differ from mine. Just accept that it's different and move on.
1963,33,0,40,ISFP,43,"<no>  I rarely ask my friends to meet me. Even if we are close friends, we don't ask to meet first because we get bored after a while and meeting each other becomes annoying."
1964,33,0,40,ISFP,44,"<Yes> If plans are disrupted, we try to get back to you quickly. The company has a set amount per day, but it was stopped for a short time due to a small breakdown."
1965,33,0,40,ISFP,45,"<Yes>  There are times when you regret making mistakes long ago. I have been scammed in the past, and I regret that if I had been a bit more alert then I would not have been scammed."
1966,33,0,40,ISFP,46,<no>  You don't think deeply about why you exist and live. You don't think deeply about difficult things.
1967,33,0,40,ISFP,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions rather than being swayed by them. Rather than expressing emotions right away in a situation where you are angry, you clear your emotions once and then speak."
1968,33,0,40,ISFP,48,"<Yes>  Even if it's the other person's fault, I try to save the other person's face. The other person also has pride, so I tend to keep my pride from breaking."
1981,34,1,40,ESFP,1,"<neutrality>  don't make new friends regularly. Depending on the situation, make friends for new meetings or activities."
1982,34,1,40,ESFP,2,"<neutrality>  I don't spend much of my free time exploring different interests. However, these days, my interest is watching YouTube and blogging a lot to find ways to make money besides my salary."
1983,34,1,40,ESFP,3,"<Yes> When I see someone else crying, I always cry. The person's feelings are conveyed intact, and empathy is good."
1984,34,1,40,ESFP,4,<no>  I don't make multiple contingency plans in case things go wrong. We strive to live happily and wisely in the present.
1985,34,1,40,ESFP,5,"<neutrality>  sometimes find it difficult to maintain my composure in high-pressure environments. I've been married for 7 years, but I don't have a baby yet, so the adults around me give me a lot of worry and pressure. There are times when I reply with a smile saying that I am working hard, and there are times when I yell at them not to stress them out."
1986,34,1,40,ESFP,6,<no>  I don't find it difficult to introduce myself to new people first at a party or event. I love talking to people I don't know and hearing their lifestyle and thoughts.
1987,34,1,40,ESFP,7,"<Yes>  After I fully complete one project, I start another. I go on a trip after doing company business to go on a trip."
1988,34,1,40,ESFP,8,"<Yes>  I am very sentimental. When someone else cries, I cry unconditionally, and after watching dramas or movies, I quickly empathize with the main character, and I almost fall for him as if he were the main character."
1989,34,1,40,ESFP,9,"<no>  don't plan with schedules or lists. Even if I go on a trip, I always find and go, and I like to meet up on the same day without making an appointment in advance."
1990,34,1,40,ESFP,10,"<Yes>  Even small mistakes make me doubt my ability or knowledge. As a team leader in a company, when I instruct employees to do work-related tasks, some employees do it diligently, while others don't do it at all."
1991,34,1,40,ESFP,11,"<Yes>  I find it easy to approach and talk to people I am interested in. When a new semester begins, I always approach first and make friends, and at work, I approach my classmates and seniors first and become close."
1992,34,1,40,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in discussing the different interpretations of works of art. I don't really know much about art, and I think art is the exclusive property of rich people who have a lot of money and a lot of time."
1993,34,1,40,ESFP,13,"<no>  I tend to follow emotions rather than reason. The evaluation of the surroundings is also the same. Emotions precede rationality, and tears often come first, or there are many things to say, but swallowed inwardly."
1994,34,1,40,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  I like to spontaneously do what I want to do rather than plan my day. After work, if the groom is not at home, find someone to meet in a hurry, have dinner together, and go home."
1995,34,1,40,ESFP,15,<Yes>  I don't care what other people see me as. I think I am important and it doesn't matter how others see me.
1996,34,1,40,ESFP,16,"<no>  Originally, I enjoyed participating in group activities, but these days, I rarely do group activities and meet mainly in small groups because of the corona situation."
1997,34,1,40,ESFP,17,<no>  like books and movies with an accurate ending. Because books and movies are meant to pass the time rather than to be taken seriously.
1998,34,1,40,ESFP,18,"<no>  I find more satisfaction in my own success than in helping others succeed. On the outside, we congratulate others on their success, but on the inside we feel sick to our stomach."
1999,34,1,40,ESFP,19,<no>  I don't have many interests. My most recent interest is learning how to make money outside of my paycheck.
2000,34,1,40,ESFP,20,<no>  I don't worry too much because I almost forget it. Worrying doesn't seem to solve it.
2001,34,1,40,ESFP,21,<no>  I don't want to avoid taking a leadership role in a group. I like to stand out and stand out in front of others.
2002,34,1,40,ESFP,22,"<no>  don't think I have very little artistic inclination. I like to watch musicals, sing along well, and know how to play several different instruments."
2003,34,1,40,ESFP,23,<no>  I don't think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. I believe that emotions and reason should coexist.
2004,34,1,40,ESFP,24,"<no>  For me, rest is rest, so I don't bother to finish my chores before taking a break. I think you can do housework later."
2005,34,1,40,ESFP,25,<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. It is a pacifist personality.
2006,34,1,40,ESFP,26,"<no>  I tend to try to get other people's attention. You want to be the leader of a group, you want to stand out, you want to be noticed."
2007,34,1,40,ESFP,27,"<Yes>  I feel that emotions tend to change very quickly these days. When I go to work, I feel good, but when I come to work, I get annoyed and angry."
2008,34,1,40,ESFP,28,<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who are not effective. I get angry at my boss or subordinates who are not effective at work.
2009,34,1,40,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. The client company needed to write a report for due diligence, so there was a deadline for preparation from a month ago, but I started writing the report with a week left."
2010,34,1,40,ESFP,30,<no>  don't believe in an afterlife. I do not believe in the Christian mother faith.
2011,34,1,40,ESFP,31,"<Yes>  I would rather spend time with other people than alone. Especially these days, it's more difficult to meet people, so I have a lot of time alone, so I want to spend time with other people even more."
2012,34,1,40,ESFP,32,"<Yes> I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I think principled stories are boring. I think the story of living in the world is not based on theory, but based on experience or wisdom."
2013,34,1,40,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  I can easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds. These days, there are many suicides of basic livelihood recipients in the news, and although their backgrounds are different, I can sympathize with them."
2014,34,1,40,ESFP,34,"<neutrality>  I tend to make decisions easily, and sometimes I put them off until the last minute. For example, if you go on a trip right now on the weekend, if you have time, you decide to go on an impromptu basis. But when I buy clothes or shoes, I check several times and make a decision."
2015,34,1,40,ESFP,35,"<neutrality> There are times when I don't reconsider the decisions I've already made, and there are times when I do think again and regret it. I thought I was relieved to quit the company at that time, but after seeing it, I regret that I just went to work."
2016,34,1,40,ESFP,36,"<neutrality>  I like to unwind with fun parties and events, but I also like to unwind by watching a movie or an overdue drama."
2017,34,1,40,ESFP,37,"<no>  don't like to go to museums or to admire works of art. I don't have opinions about art, but I think it's something that people with a lot of time and money enjoy."
2018,34,1,40,ESFP,38,"<no>  I am very understanding of other people's feelings. When a co-worker says he's sad because he broke up with his boyfriend, he comforts them and eats something delicious to cheer them up."
2019,34,1,40,ESFP,39,<no>  I don't plan what to do every day. Find what you need to do at that time and do it.
2020,34,1,40,ESFP,40,"<Yes>  rarely feel insecure. It's not a reason, it seems to be an innate tendency."
2021,34,1,40,ESFP,41,<neutrality>  I want to avoid making phone calls to people in need and I want to call people I like.
2022,34,1,40,ESFP,42,"<Yes>  spend a lot of time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. If the company presents an opinion to the boss, but the opinion is different from the boss's opinion, the boss's opinion is not understood at first, but a lot of time passes and you try to understand it."
2023,34,1,40,ESFP,43,<Yes>  I contact my friends to meet up first. I tend to keep in touch according to my schedule.
2024,34,1,40,ESFP,44,"<no>  If my plan is disrupted, I don't try to get back to it as quickly as possible. We respond appropriately to the current situation."
2025,34,1,40,ESFP,45,<Yes>  I often regret mistakes made long ago. I regret it when colleagues from my previous job get promoted and are building their careers well.
2026,34,1,40,ESFP,46,"<Yes>  I don't think deeply about human existence and why we live. It's profound and deep thinking, so I try to live happily and content with my current life."
2027,34,1,40,ESFP,47,"<Yes>  Rather than controlling my emotions, I tend to be swayed by my emotions a lot. I think the people around me should adjust according to my feelings."
2028,34,1,40,ESFP,48,"<no>  When it is clear that the other person is at fault, I try to point out the fault without making him feel bad. It's because you can grow and develop if you know your mistakes."
2041,35,1,30,ENTP,1,"<no>  don't feel like making new friends. The reason is that while working outside, they naturally meet and become friends in many cases."
2042,35,1,30,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  I like to learn things that are fun and energizes my life. These days, I'm learning rice cake and I'm thinking of taking a certification exam."
2043,35,1,30,ENTP,3,"<neutrality>  It is rare for me to relate to a situation where someone else is crying, but when I see a family member getting sick or dying, I empathize and shed tears."
2044,35,1,30,ENTP,4,"<neutrality>  I think in case things go wrong, but I'm not the type to make preparations. The reason is that I have to set up a countermeasure, but I give up because it's annoying."
2045,35,1,30,ENTP,5,"<neutrality>  I try to keep my composure, but my limbs tremble and my voice cracks. But people around me say it doesn't show."
2046,35,1,30,ENTP,6,"<neutrality>  tend to say hello to people I already know before approaching new people. There are many cases where I wonder what kind of person the reason is, so I tend to approach him first."
2047,35,1,30,ENTP,7,<no>  I tend to start other projects before completing one. The reason is that I feel bored quickly with my personality that I can't finish one.
2048,35,1,30,ENTP,8,"<no>  I guess I'm not sentimental. Reason doesn't seem to assimilate to emotions, and life is calm enough to be monotonous."
2049,35,1,30,ENTP,9,"<no>  I try to make plans, but they don't go more than three days. The reason seems to be a big hassle."
2050,35,1,30,ENTP,10,<no>  I'm the type of person who just overlooks small mistakes. There was never a moment when I doubted my ability or knowledge. The reason is that anyone can make mistakes.
2051,35,1,30,ENTP,11,"<neutrality> It's a bit difficult for me to approach and start a conversation with people of the opposite sex, but I think it's mostly easy for people of the same sex. The reason seems to be a little difficult because there is a trembling feeling in the case of the opposite sex that I like."
2052,35,1,30,ENTP,12,"<no>  I love talking about art from different perspectives. The reason is that each person has different thoughts and different eyes to see, so I think the interpretation may be different. It's fun to discuss from different perspectives."
2053,35,1,30,ENTP,13,"<neutrality>  I am emotional, but in most cases, I seem to be on the side of trying to talk rationally rather than being emotional. The evaluation of the surroundings is similar."
2054,35,1,30,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  I seem to prefer doing what I want to do and where I want to go that day rather than making and following a plan. Even when I go on an overseas trip, I tend to just book a flight and leave rather than making detailed plans."
2055,35,1,30,ENTP,15,"<Yes>  I think it's more important what I think of me than worrying about what other people think of me. The reason is that what others see is fragmentary, and what they see is not everything."
2056,35,1,30,ENTP,16,"<neutrality>  I think what kind of organization is important. I don't enjoy group activities at work, but group activities with people who share hobbies are fun."
2057,35,1,30,ENTP,17,<no>  I don't like open endings. The reason is that there are many experiences where the time spent watching endless books and movies was a waste.
2058,35,1,30,ENTP,18,"<no>  I love helping others succeed, but I don't feel very satisfied. The reason is that my success gives me greater satisfaction."
2059,35,1,30,ENTP,19,"<neutrality> I'm a person who has a lot of things I want to do, but I have so many interests that I don't know what to do next. The reason is that out of many interests, it is clear which one you like more."
2060,35,1,30,ENTP,20,"<no>  I'm not the type to worry about things going wrong. The reason is that if things fail, they aren't affected much."
2061,35,1,30,ENTP,21,"<neutrality>  guess I'm neutral. The reason is that I feel tired when I take on the role of a leader, so I feel like avoiding it, but I also like being in the center and leading people to unity."
2062,35,1,30,ENTP,22,"<no>  I like and am interested in art. The reason is that I have a hobby of drawing, so I paint oil paintings when I have time."
2063,35,1,30,ENTP,23,"<no>  think it's important to be rational, but sometimes emotions should take precedence. I think you can lose people's hearts if you only value the opposite sex."
2064,35,1,30,ENTP,24,"<no>  I don't finish my chores first. The reason is that cleaning at home is the most annoying, so I have a habit of putting it off until later."
2065,35,1,30,ENTP,25,"<neutrality>  I like to argue and I like to watch. However, I don't like it when emotions mix and turn into an emotional fight rather than an argument."
2066,35,1,30,ENTP,26,<neutrality>  I guess I'm neutral. The reason is that sometimes you want to get other people's attention.
2067,35,1,30,ENTP,27,"<neutrality>  I usually have calm emotions, but when something unfair or angry happens, my emotions tend to flare up quickly."
2068,35,1,30,ENTP,28,"<Yes> I'm a person who likes to be efficient, so it's very annoying to see things done inefficiently. It's very annoying, especially repeating two or three times what I could have done in one go."
2069,35,1,30,ENTP,29,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to do things in advance. I had to submit an evaluation recently, but I put it off until the last day and submitted it."
2070,35,1,30,ENTP,30,"<Yes> As someone who believes there is an afterlife, a related question strikes me as interesting. The reason is that I live my daily life after I was born, but I am curious about the afterlife after hearing that it will end just because I die."
2071,35,1,30,ENTP,31,"<neutrality>  I like to be alone, but I also like to have fun with other people. These days, I enjoy hanging out with my colleagues, playing bowling, eating delicious dinner, and talking."
2072,35,1,30,ENTP,32,"<neutrality>  have a lot of interest in discussions, so I don't think it's boring if you're interested in it even if it's theory-oriented. Even if you don't know the theory, if you're interested, you'll enjoy listening to it."
2073,35,1,30,ENTP,33,"<neutrality>  I think it would feel fresh if the background was completely different from mine, but I'm not sure I can easily relate to it. You may be able to easily allow your side by looking at your personality rather than your background."
2074,35,1,30,ENTP,34,"<neutrality>  I think a lot and make decisions, but there are times when I make decisions quickly, so I am neutral."
2075,35,1,30,ENTP,35,"<neutrality>  If I have any regrets about a decision, I tend to keep thinking about it. The reason is that if you make a decision in a hurry because you don't have time, you keep thinking about it."
2076,35,1,30,ENTP,36,"<no>  I tend to relax and relieve fatigue by myself. Parties and events are fun, but I tend to enjoy them when I have stamina due to fatigue."
2077,35,1,30,ENTP,37,"<Yes>  like going to art galleries and spending time quietly. The reason is that when you look at a painting in a quiet space, you don't have other complicated thoughts."
2078,35,1,30,ENTP,38,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to think deeply about other people's feelings, so it's not too hard for me. However, it is often difficult to understand people who express their emotions violently."
2079,35,1,30,ENTP,39,"<<No>  I'm not the type to plan things, so I often get stressed out when I'm asked to plan."
2080,35,1,30,ENTP,40,"<neutrality>  I sometimes feel insecure. I don't know if I have deep affection for my parents, but I'm afraid of the future of being left alone."
2081,35,1,30,ENTP,41,<neutrality>  It seems that there are times when I want to avoid talking on the phone while working. I want to avoid especially difficult opponents. But it's always fun to talk to people you're comfortable with.
2082,35,1,30,ENTP,42,"<no>  I try to understand, but I don't tend to spend a lot of time. The reason is that time is wasted."
2083,35,1,30,ENTP,43,<neutrality>  I sometimes contact my friends to meet up. I contact you when I have a lot of free time or when I go to play in an area where many friends live.
2084,35,1,30,ENTP,44,"<no>  I'm not the type to stick to my plans, so I'm not affected much if my plans go awry."
2085,35,1,30,ENTP,45,"<Yes>  I often regret actions I did a long time ago. It's an action that can't be undone, but I think about it from time to time."
2086,35,1,30,ENTP,46,"<neutrality>  I don't think deeply about human existence and the reason for living, but I'm not interested at all. I don't set goals in life, but I often think about how to live."
2087,35,1,30,ENTP,47,"<neutrality>  think it's medium. People around me say that I am rational, but sometimes I get excited and get swept away by my emotions."
2088,35,1,30,ENTP,48,"<neutrality>  When I don't admit the wrongdoing of the other person, I don't think that I have to save the other person's face. However, if you are worried that the other person will be embarrassed, you will think about saving face."
2101,36,0,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  After making friends, I don't make more friends than necessary because I eat, drink, and spend a lot."
2102,36,0,30,ISTJ,2,"<Yes>  I'm interested in music these days, so I'm learning the guitar. You can find many related videos on YouTube."
2103,36,0,30,ISTJ,3,"<no>  There are many cases where I don't really understand why the person is crying, so tears don't come out. I just rationally think of why I cry first."
2104,36,0,30,ISTJ,4,"<no>  This is because they are optimistic by nature and believe that if a problem arises, it can be solved quickly."
2105,36,0,30,ISTJ,5,"<neutrality>  On the one hand, I am worried about the elders telling me to get married and get a job when I am old, but I just accept it calmly."
2106,36,0,30,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  I tend to be shy, so I don't try to expand my human relationships except in special cases."
2107,36,0,30,ISTJ,7,"<Yes>  I am not good at multitasking, so when I do one thing, I have to finish it. I've been doing it that way lately too."
2108,36,0,30,ISTJ,8,<no>  Appreciating poetry or looking at literary works usually just feels trivial. I tend to like realistic things like non-literature rather than sentimental things.
2109,36,0,30,ISTJ,9,<no>  It's usually a style of spontaneously going to a travel destination and searching the Internet on the spot to find a nearby restaurant.
2110,36,0,30,ISTJ,10,"<Yes>  practice guitar, and I often think I'm good at it, but if I make a few mistakes, I often wonder if this is my original skill."
2111,36,0,30,ISTJ,11,"<no>  In my case, it's rather easy to approach if you're not interested. I feel uncomfortable because I am afraid that the other person will find out that I am interested."
2112,36,0,30,ISTJ,12,<Yes>  I am satisfied with what I intuitively see and feel. Wearing quadrupeds doesn't fit my personality.
2113,36,0,30,ISTJ,13,"<Yes>  think it was because I was very sensitive when I was young, but as I get older, my sensitivity seems to dull."
2114,36,0,30,ISTJ,14,"<Yes>  Once you have a plan, you feel comfortable letting yourself go like water because you feel the pressure to do it."
2115,36,0,30,ISTJ,15,"<no>  When I feel that my grades, age, wealth, marital status, etc. do not meet the standards, I am often conscious of what my image will be to the other person when I meet a new person."
2116,36,0,30,ISTJ,16,"<neutrality>  It's good to meet people. However, every time we meet, we get bored with the formal pattern."
2117,36,0,30,ISTJ,17,<no>  I like to leave it to the worldview and ending thoroughly laid out by the author. I don't enjoy things that seem complicated with their own interpretations.
2118,36,0,30,ISTJ,18,<no>  am a person with strong individualism. I care more about my success than the success of others. I don't think it's too late to pay attention to other people's success after I've succeeded.
2119,36,0,30,ISTJ,19,"<no>  I've never had the experience of growing my interest too much. In my case, if I have a lot of interest, I cut it off."
2120,36,0,30,ISTJ,20,"<neutrality>  At the same time as worrying, they also show an optimistic attitude. It's because you don't think anything will get better if you worry anyway."
2121,36,0,30,ISTJ,21,"<Yes> He has no leadership and is very reluctant to stand in front of others. For that reason, I never took on a leadership role during my school days."
2122,36,0,30,ISTJ,22,"<no>  I'm learning the guitar as a hobby, because I've been playing for a long time and I think I'm better than others."
2123,36,0,30,ISTJ,23,"<neutrality>  To be honest, I'm not an expert on that, so I don't know. Wouldn't it be nice to have a balance as much as humans have emotions and reason?"
2124,36,0,30,ISTJ,24,"<Yes>  It is uncomfortable to take a break if you do not finish what you have already decided to do, so if it is not difficult and simple, I prefer to finish and rest."
2125,36,0,30,ISTJ,25,<Yes>  There are many times to have fun. The reason is because I think listening to different opinions broadens the perspectives I can have.
2126,36,0,30,ISTJ,26,<Yes> I'm a style that likes to be quietly buried. I think it's because I'm an introvert and I don't have much confidence.
2127,36,0,30,ISTJ,27,<no>  I usually maintain a calm feeling almost constantly in my life unless there is something special going on.
2128,36,0,30,ISTJ,28,"<neutrality>  I think it was like that when I was younger. However, when I get older, rather than being annoyed, I feel the need to help that person first."
2129,36,0,30,ISTJ,29,"<no> Because I don't create things I wouldn't normally be able to do, I rarely put off things that I can do."
2130,36,0,30,ISTJ,30,"<no>  When you die, you think that you are completely well with this world, so you don't wonder about existence in the afterlife."
2131,36,0,30,ISTJ,31,"<neutrality>  There are times when you are alone when you are alone, and there are times when you are tired when you are with others. So it's hard for me to decide which one is better."
2132,36,0,30,ISTJ,32,"<no> If the theory is not complicated, the original story is considered to be retracing the root of the story, so it doesn't feel boring."
2133,36,0,30,ISTJ,33,<neutrality>  How can you relate so easily when the circumstances you have lived in are different? I think it will take a few months to understand a little bit.
2134,36,0,30,ISTJ,34,"<no>  Unless it's a particularly difficult decision, I tend to make decisions relatively quickly."
2135,36,0,30,ISTJ,35,"<neutrality> There are quite a few times when I make a decision and regret it. However, I usually try to avoid revisiting decisions as much as possible."
2136,36,0,30,ISTJ,36,"<no>  I am doing well by watching movies, listening to music, and watching YouTube by myself. I usually rarely see my friends."
2137,36,0,30,ISTJ,37,<no>  I have never paid to go to an exhibition or gallery myself. It's out of my interest.
2138,36,0,30,ISTJ,38,"<neutrality> Everyone's situation is different, but I think it's relatively easy for people in the same culture to understand."
2139,36,0,30,ISTJ,39,"<neutrality>  I organize things in my head to a certain extent, but I don't like to plan things by nature."
2140,36,0,30,ISTJ,40,"<neutrality>  I don't have a lot of anxiety about the future, but sometimes I feel it. I am afraid, especially when I imagine the time when my parents died."
2141,36,0,30,ISTJ,41,<no>  prefer direct phone calls and voice conversations rather than text messages.
2142,36,0,30,ISTJ,42,"<no>  I don't bother trying to understand other opinions. It just goes beyond ""You think differently because you're a different person."""
2143,36,0,30,ISTJ,43,"<neutrality>  For weddings and funerals, I tend to ask first if they are coming. However, I tend to wait for invitations when attending meetings in private."
2144,36,0,30,ISTJ,44,"<no>  usually do things spontaneously, so I can say that it doesn't matter too much if the plan goes wrong."
2145,36,0,30,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  There are times when I spend a lot of time alone, and as I grow older, I look back on the past and regret such things."
2146,36,0,30,ISTJ,46,"<neutrality>  Sometimes philosophical questions linger in my head, but I don't think deeply about them."
2147,36,0,30,ISTJ,47,<neutrality>  I don't think I've matured enough to control my emotions yet. People around me think the same way.
2148,36,0,30,ISTJ,48,"<Yes>  By nature, I don't want to see others humiliate in front of me. That's why they seem to care as much as possible."
2161,37,1,40,ESFJ,1,<neutrality>  I'm not deliberately trying to make friends. There are many cases where you meet friends of friends or acquaintances and become friends. The reason is that it seems to be a more comfortable friend to meet naturally and become friends.
2162,37,1,40,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  I spend a good part of my free time exploring new things. The reason is that I am always interested in and curious about new things, so when I want to know something, I explore the field, determine whether I can do it or not, and explore it with other interests. What I'm interested in these days is exploring the housing manager."
2163,37,1,40,ESFJ,3,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. Tears just come to my eyes when I see them crying at a wedding when they get sick or die about their parents. The reason is that my parents passed away early, so I cry about my parents, cry during the wedding, and feel sad in my arms."
2164,37,1,40,ESFJ,4,"<Yes>  I work with a number of cases. The reason is that in the past, I worked with the conviction that it was just unconditional, but I had an experience that an unexpected path made it absurd and suffered financial damage and was unable to solve the work, so I prepared carefully in everything."
2165,37,1,40,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  I tend to keep my composure. A while ago, there was a quarrel between residents in the villa, and on the other hand, I was angry, but rational judgment is important, so I tried to keep my composure without permission. I try to judge everything rationally, and even if I am criticized and put under pressure for various reasons, I act consistently and do not go against logic."
2166,37,1,40,ESFJ,6,"<Yes>  I don't like to introduce myself first. The reason is that it is awkward and uncomfortable to have a conversation with someone you are meeting for the first time. Talk to someone you already know. Then, if you talk to them first, you will have a conversation right away."
2167,37,1,40,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  The reason is that I focus on completing what I have to do, so I can focus on another new task, so I tend to do it right away."
2168,37,1,40,ESFJ,8,"<no>  I'm not sentimental, it seems realistic. I think it was too sentimental when I was young, but now it's extremely realistic. The older I get, the more realistic it seems."
2169,37,1,40,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  Even if it doesn't go well with the plan, it's because it's fun and anticipation while making a plan. I like to write in my diary, and when I look at it after a while, I get lost in old thoughts."
2170,37,1,40,ESFJ,10,"<no>  On the one hand, I want to do everything perfectly, but I think people can't be perfect. I don't want to doubt my ability with that little mistake. There have been mistakes recently due to blinking, but I don't think it's a matter of doubting your ability or knowledge."
2171,37,1,40,ESFJ,11,"<neutrality> It seems to be different depending on the place or situation. It is not difficult to have a conversation in an open place and in a relaxed and free atmosphere, but it is difficult to have a conversation in an uncomfortable place."
2172,37,1,40,ESFJ,12,"<no>  I am a writer majoring in art. It's something I do every time, it's my biggest interest, and it's my strength, so I discuss and study every time."
2173,37,1,40,ESFJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. People around me also say that I judge rationally, and I tend to listen to my opinions."
2174,37,1,40,ESFJ,14,<no>  I tend to plan my day the day before and work. All schedules are pre-planned and very occasionally improvised.
2175,37,1,40,ESFJ,15,"<Yes>  I worry a lot about how I look to others. There is no particular occasion or reason, but it seems that it was originally like that. There are many times when I'm careful that someone who harms me or does something I don't like."
2176,37,1,40,ESFJ,16,"<Yes>  I like an active life. I like doing group activities, meeting people and learning things I can learn from. These days, I am active in various organizations such as the director of the art association, the village head (bankbook), and the bowling club."
2177,37,1,40,ESFJ,17,"<no>  like to know the ending directly and immediately. After watching the drama 'My Liberation Journal' recently, I was annoyed by the ending. It's because of the ending that seems to be interpreted in your own way."
2178,37,1,40,ESFJ,18,<neutrality>  I honestly think my success would be more satisfying. That doesn't mean that you don't feel satisfied helping others succeed. I feel as satisfied as my success. It is the satisfaction of knowing that my help has helped someone succeed.
2179,37,1,40,ESFJ,19,<Yes>  I've recently developed a few interests. It's hard to prioritize and I still haven't figured out what I can do better.
2180,37,1,40,ESFJ,20,"<neutrality>  I don't worry too much about doing things wrong. However, I worry every time in the field where I don't have experience. I'm not that confident yet."
2181,37,1,40,ESFJ,21,"<Yes>  am very afraid of standing in front of people and talking. A lot of tension too. But a comfy seat is fine, for example, as the leader of an alumni gathering."
2182,37,1,40,ESFJ,22,"<no>  I am an artist by profession. I have been drawing art (pictures) since I was young, and now I am also an artist."
2183,37,1,40,ESFJ,23,"<no>  If only rationality was valued, the world would be barren. I think there should be a moderate amount of people who have emotions and people who are rational."
2184,37,1,40,ESFJ,24,<Yes>  Finish the house first so you can relax and feel free. But sometimes you just don't want to do it. Then just take a break before finishing.
2185,37,1,40,ESFJ,25,<no>  I hate arguments. It's very uncomfortable when an argument leads to blushing and makes each other uncomfortable.
2186,37,1,40,ESFJ,26,<Yes>  hate attracting attention. It's burdensome and uncomfortable when everyone around me is looking at me.
2187,37,1,40,ESFJ,27,"<no>  When my emotions change, I need a certain amount of time. It happens once in a while, but for very small things."
2188,37,1,40,ESFJ,28,<no>  I don't think so. I think everyone's solution is wrong.
2189,37,1,40,ESFJ,29,"<Yes>  plan ahead and take care of what needs to be done last. It should be near the end so you can concentrate better and work will be done quickly. Even recently, I do about a third of it in advance and the rest at the end."
2190,37,1,40,ESFJ,30,"<no>  I'm not interested. I wonder what it would really be like once in a while, but I don't think it's interesting."
2191,37,1,40,ESFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I enjoy spending time with other people, but sometimes I want to be alone when I'm tired. These days, it seems like there are more times when I want to be alone."
2192,37,1,40,ESFJ,32,<Yes>  I often get bored with theory-based discussions. I don't like discussions where the same answer is theoretically solved by what I already know.
2193,37,1,40,ESFJ,33,"<Yes>  I have many friends from different backgrounds. There are cases where things have changed over the course of our lives, and as we listen to each other's stories of living in various backgrounds, I think we can think of myself as having such a background. Every time I meet my friends, I hear unexpected stories."
2194,37,1,40,ESFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to put it off until the end. Rather than making a decision in advance, I think about it until the end, think a lot about this and that, compare and analyze."
2195,37,1,40,ESFJ,35,"<no>  I think again. Even if you have already made a decision, you will think again. I keep thinking about something without knowing it."
2196,37,1,40,ESFJ,36,"<no> Until my 30s, I enjoyed events and parties to relieve fatigue, but now that I am in my 40s and I am tired of caring for children, I relieve fatigue with alone time and sleep."
2197,37,1,40,ESFJ,37,"<Yes>  Since I am an artist, I often exhibit and unintentionally visit art exhibitions."
2198,37,1,40,ESFJ,38,"<Yes> Sometimes I have a hard time understanding. I try to understand if I am feeling like that, but there are many times when I can't. I try to refrain from my emotions according to my boss's mood in a very realistic work life, but when other colleagues express their negative thoughts and bad feelings directly to their boss, it is difficult to understand."
2199,37,1,40,ESFJ,39,<Yes>  I like to write and plan by hand. I love both work and personal things.
2200,37,1,40,ESFJ,40,"<no> There are times when I feel insecure. It's not a natural inclination, but after seeing a situation where a person in their 20s was taken to the emergency room after drinking and fighting, I feel anxious when there is a loud noise in the street or in the house at night."
2201,37,1,40,ESFJ,41,<no>  I often feel more comfortable talking on the phone than face-to-face. I do well over the phone unless it's really something to see and talk about in person.
2202,37,1,40,ESFJ,42,"<Yes> It didn't go well with me. Recently, I couldn't communicate well with one of the villa residents, so I used to spend more than a month, but in the end I couldn't understand."
2203,37,1,40,ESFJ,43,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I do it first, and sometimes friends contact me. It's almost half and half."
2204,37,1,40,ESFJ,44,"<Yes> If there is a problem with the plan, I quickly redefine the plan before the implementation date. Recently, while preparing for an art exhibition, one of the participating artists notified the day before the exhibition that they could not participate, so there was a sudden rescheduling of the exhibition hall dpi with the other management team."
2205,37,1,40,ESFJ,45,<no>  I've never regretted a mistake I've made in a long time. I have never regretted my choice.
2206,37,1,40,ESFJ,46,"<Yes>  consider it a luxury to think about existence and the reason for living. We exist because we are human, and the reason for life is to live. As you get older, yes. When I was young, I think I thought deeply about life and human existence."
2207,37,1,40,ESFJ,47,<no>  I think you can control your emotions. People around me say that I am good at controlling my emotions.
2208,37,1,40,ESFJ,48,"<no>  It seems I'm not trying. When you judge rationally and make a mistake, you don't do it to the other person for the sake of face. Just watching."
2221,38,0,40,INFJ,1,<no>  I don't have enough time and resources to make new friends by spending a lot of time with my co-workers after getting married and working.
2222,38,0,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  I am interested in video editing, so I want to go to a professional academy, but I don't have time, so I watch the Internet or YouTube videos and learn video editing skills."
2223,38,0,40,INFJ,3,"<no>  He is not so agitated or sad even when other people are crying, except for his family or parents and siblings."
2224,38,0,40,INFJ,4,"<neutrality>  If I lead the team, I make preparations, but as a team member, I only work according to the person who leads the work, but I do not make various preparations and work. They just act according to the guidelines or manuals in case things go wrong."
2225,38,0,40,INFJ,5,"<no>  It is difficult to maintain composure because if pressure is applied, there will be a part where you can make mistakes and make a lot of tension. There is a tendency to try to end things by maintaining composure."
2226,38,0,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  It is comfortable to talk with someone you already know, and you are not the type to approach new people first. If the atmosphere is somewhat familiar and the conversation goes well, you will introduce yourself or try to get to know yourself later."
2227,38,0,40,INFJ,7,"<Yes> By nature, I finish one project and start another. If I spread my work here and there and it is not finished, I feel anxious and unable to concentrate, so I unconditionally finish the current project and start another project."
2228,38,0,40,INFJ,8,"<no>  When the surrounding environment and the situation match, sometimes it touches the heart, but it is sentimental only when it has a big impact. Not too sensitive, sometimes insensitive. In terms of emotions, the mind is not easily moved."
2229,38,0,40,INFJ,9,"<Yes>  When there is an important schedule or meeting, I like to digest the schedule in a planned way by managing the schedule and setting alarms through my phone. Because they hate to break each other's trust and trust, schedules and important things must be remembered and forgotten, so they proceed through alarms or schedule management."
2230,38,0,40,INFJ,10,"<neutrality> If a mistake has a big meaning, I sometimes feel heartbroken and think about why it happened, but I don't try to intervene very much with small mistakes."
2231,38,0,40,INFJ,11,"<Yes>  If you are interested, you can easily approach to have a conversation. This was not the case in the past, but as this part changes due to the environment and surroundings as you live, you can easily engage in conversation with people you are interested in and have a friendly feeling."
2232,38,0,40,INFJ,12,"<no>  My interests are far from works of art, I have no interest in getting to know them, and I don't look at them unless they are my interests."
2233,38,0,40,INFJ,13,"<Yes>  My emotions change dozens of times and hundreds of times a day, but I think that I have to control these emotions and live according to reason. If I live according to my emotions, I will have a big accident."
2234,38,0,40,INFJ,14,<Yes>  Living while planning a schedule for the day seems quite tiring and annoying. I think it's the best thing if you don't stress as much as you like.
2235,38,0,40,INFJ,15,"<neutrality> When others evaluate me, I still have to have the perception that I'm not the worst, so I try to maintain a neutral image without doing anything that other people don't like or don't like. That's why I don't try to be proud and look good."
2236,38,0,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  By doing group activities, there are always rules and regulations in groups, so there are always problems in the process of keeping and fulfilling those parts, so I like activities that I just do alone."
2237,38,0,40,INFJ,17,"<no>  I like movies more than books, I think about the ending, I don't think about this ending in my own way, I just try to understand the quality of the work. However, in movies where there are various opinions about the ending, I think about the ending with my own way of thinking and imagination."
2238,38,0,40,INFJ,18,<no> It is not in my nature to help others succeed. You have a critical and negative view of what others are doing well. I only focus on being successful and being successful.
2239,38,0,40,INFJ,19,"<no>  I have many interests, but what I have to do is clear. I'm interested in and want to do what I like, so I don't do everything I like, but I try to focus on the work that fits the reality or where I can do it."
2240,38,0,40,INFJ,20,"<no>  I try to be as perfect as possible for the work I am responsible for. I am not afraid that things will go wrong. It's because if you fix the wrong part and secure it, it becomes perfect."
2241,38,0,40,INFJ,21,"<no>  As I get older and live a social life, I have a desire to gain social status, so I think a lot about wanting to lead a group and become a recognized leader like an achievement to leave behind in my career. also longing for"
2242,38,0,40,INFJ,22,"<Yes>  Throughout my life, I have not had an opportunity to evaluate my dexterity or artistic sense, and I think that it is not my interest and my artistic sense is not rich."
2243,38,0,40,INFJ,23,"<Yes> If I had pursued emotions more, I would have acted as I wanted, but I think the world exists today because I valued reason more. I think people can't live only with their own emotions. If it seems like that, I think it can't be done because it's a world where only one person is alone."
2244,38,0,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  I don't like to put off things that I have to do or unfinished, so I prefer to finish and rest in a calm state except for days when I'm tired or not feeling well."
2245,38,0,40,INFJ,25,"<Yes>  It's because I think it's interesting to hear what each other's argument is, to be interested in it, to think about my thoughts, and to judge who is right."
2246,38,0,40,INFJ,26,"<neutrality>  I don't like to stand out too much, but I still have the thought that it would be nice if people knew a little about me, so sometimes I get attention. But don't try to draw too much attention."
2247,38,0,40,INFJ,27,"<neutrality>  Emotions change appropriately to the situation, but not very quickly. If it's something convincing and can move emotions, it changes according to the situation, but it doesn't seem to change easily."
2248,38,0,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes> When working at a company, you need to think about how to derive results in order to establish a plan and achieve the plan, and work efficiently. ."
2249,38,0,40,INFJ,29,"<no>  By nature, I never put off what I have to do. I prefer to finish things unconditionally because putting off things to do is inconvenient and I keep thinking about it."
2250,38,0,40,INFJ,30,"<no>  think there is only fear about death, but it is not interesting. People are the most afraid and scared at the last moment, and I am also afraid and scared. I don't want to think much about the afterlife."
2251,38,0,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  It is comfortable to be alone. These days, when many people are in chaos with the same corona plague, they try to enjoy life alone as much as possible and do not want to spend time with others. I just want to rest comfortably by myself."
2252,38,0,40,INFJ,32,"<Yes>  Rather than principles, I hate discussions that are somewhat flexible and rigid. Principles and principles are important, but I like to coordinate the parts that need to be coordinated to some extent and finish them in a part that does not deviate from the center of the discussion."
2253,38,0,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  A person with a good background, a high social status or command, and a persuasive speech are considered very favorable. Also, because there are things to learn, there are many things that I can relate to."

2255,38,0,40,INFJ,35,"<Yes>  I don't think much about decisions I've already made. When I think about it, I hate repeating things, and I hate talking about a decision I made once."
2256,38,0,40,INFJ,36,"<neutrality>  Sometimes alone time is good, but when there is a fun party or event, I like it because I feel happy about that part. However, frequent parties and events rather increase or decrease fatigue, so proper coordination seems to be good."
2257,38,0,40,INFJ,37,"<no>  I've never been there and I don't like it, so I don't like it because I'm not interested in it."
2258,38,0,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  If you have good emotional communication skills, you tend to fully understand and listen. Also, because he is quick-witted, he can understand to some extent how the person is feeling, so there was not much difficulty."
2259,38,0,40,INFJ,39,"<no>  I don't like it because it's difficult and annoying, and I work with a certain amount of planning for important tasks."
2260,38,0,40,INFJ,40,"<no> Depending on the situation, when things don't go well or when you make a big mistake, you feel anxious and tend to think about it over and over again."
2261,38,0,40,INFJ,41,"<no>  Except when it's not necessary, I make phone calls when I feel the need to be in touch or something urgent."
2262,38,0,40,INFJ,42,"<no>  usually have a good understanding of other opinions and don't spend much time. They take their time when they feel the need, but most don't. They don't take the time to understand other opinions."
2263,38,0,40,INFJ,43,"<no>  Most of them contact me and meet me or contact me first because I contact them when I feel the need, so I don't often contact them to meet them first."
2264,38,0,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback in the plan, I want to return in a positive way as much as possible as long as the plan does not go wrong. Recently, I bought an expensive item at a department store, and there was a monthly settlement amount I planned for the price of the item, but the clerk's mistake caused a setback in my planned monthly settlement amount, so I had an experience of discussing this matter with the clerk and resolving it smoothly."
2265,38,0,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes>  Living in reality immediately, I often think that the part that happened a long time ago was good. I am not very satisfied with my current work life, and I am dissatisfied with the twisted lifestyle."
2266,38,0,40,INFJ,46,"<Yes>  don't live with the meaning of thinking deeply about human existence and the reason for life. It's just that human beings were born, and because of that, they live to live, earn to live, build a family, and raise children."
2267,38,0,40,INFJ,47,"<Yes>  They are spontaneous with their emotions, so they have simple feelings of disliking when people say they hate it and liking it when they say something good, and react sensitively to their surroundings."
2268,38,0,40,INFJ,48,<no> He speaks clearly about the wrong part and never loses or turns a blind eye to it. Because that look doesn't suit me.
2281,39,0,40,ENTJ,1,"<neutrality>  When I was abroad or before the corona, I made new friends regularly, but not now. Now, rather than making new friends, I meet old ones."
2282,39,0,40,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  I spend a lot of my free time on things that interest me. I watch movies, dramas, or cartoons. Also play games, dance or meet people."
2283,39,0,40,ENTJ,3,"<neutrality>  When I watch a movie or drama, I cry when I see a sad scene or a scene that I sympathize with. In particular, there are many cases where the same things or the same experiences can be shared. I feel sad or sad a lot."
2284,39,0,40,ENTJ,4,"<Yes> Things don't always go as planned, so I tend to have a lot of contingency plans in case things go wrong. If there is a setback in the plan, there are many cases where you get flustered and make more mistakes. So, make preparations so that you can make quick corrections without making more mistakes."
2285,39,0,40,ENTJ,5,"<neutrality> We try to remain as calm as possible in a high-pressure environment. Of course, if the psychological pressure is severe, you will act emotionally, and then you will make a lot of mistakes. Especially in the case of certification practical exams, even simple tasks must be done within the time limit without mistakes, but if you lose your composure under time pressure, you will make unexpected mistakes."
2286,39,0,40,ENTJ,6,"<neutrality> First, talk to someone you already know. In the meantime, I make new friends by meeting new people through people I already know. Talking to someone you already know is more comfortable than talking to someone you don't know."
2287,39,0,40,ENTJ,7,"<Yes> If you work on another project in the middle of one project, it is difficult to focus on one project. If you say that there is housework and rest, it is difficult to relax comfortably because you think you have to do housework later. That's why I prefer to relax comfortably after doing my chores."
2288,39,0,40,ENTJ,8,"<Yes>  I shed a lot of tears when I read dramas, movies, or sad or sympathetic texts."
2289,39,0,40,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  Plan and write down schedules or lists using a calendar or diary or electronic tool. There are many cases in which I plan things to be done or things to be done and then forget, so I tend to record them, and if possible, I try to prioritize them, make plans, and put them into practice."
2290,39,0,40,ENTJ,10,"<Yes> Even though I understand and memorize the knowledge I know or study, there are many cases where I check to see if I have properly disclosed the content of the knowledge to others or if I have not made a mistake."
2291,39,0,40,ENTJ,11,"<neutrality>  I tend to approach and talk to people I am interested in. However, it is difficult to comfortably approach someone you are interested in and talk about a topic that resonates with you. So, there are many cases in which a friend or acquaintance of the person you are interested in gets to know you first, and then you talk to and get close to the person you are interested in."
2292,39,0,40,ENTJ,12,"<Yes>  A work of art has many interpretations from a human point of view. This is because people have different personalities and thoughts. For that reason, discussing and persuading different interpretations of a work of art seems like a waste of time."
2293,39,0,40,ENTJ,13,"<neutrality> Sometimes emotions, sometimes reason. I try to follow reason as much as possible, but sometimes I can't control my emotions. People around me see my evaluation similarly."
2294,39,0,40,ENTJ,14,"<no>  I like to schedule my day rather than improvise. When you improvise what you want to do, you often fail to do what you need to do."
2295,39,0,40,ENTJ,15,<neutrality>  usually don't care what other people think of me. But I tend to worry about other people having bad prejudices against me. I have suffered from bad rumors.
2296,39,0,40,ENTJ,16,"<Yes>  I like to work together rather than alone. I especially love to exercise or socialize with other people. It's not a group these days, but I enjoy my hobbies like everyone else."
2297,39,0,40,ENTJ,17,<Yes>  A funny movie is better than a sad one. I prefer happy endings to sad endings. That's why I tend to enjoy movies with happy endings.
2298,39,0,40,ENTJ,18,"<neutrality> You always feel great satisfaction in your own success, but sometimes it's also rewarding to help others. In particular, I feel satisfied when I help someone I don't know well or do volunteer work so that others feel better, happier, or grateful to me."
2299,39,0,40,ENTJ,19,"<Yes> There are many things I want to do in the world. However, the reality is that time and money cannot afford it. So, you always have to prioritize and make choices that fit your reality and economy, but there are so many things you want to do that you don't know what to do."
2300,39,0,40,ENTJ,20,"<Yes>  I tend to worry that things will go wrong. I am afraid of hurting others by my mistakes in the work I do with others. When I was young, I caused damage to my friends due to my mistakes, and I was criticized by my friends because of it."
2301,39,0,40,ENTJ,21,"<neutrality>  I took on a leadership role in the group. The more people in the group and the higher the position, the greater the burden of responsibility. In particular, it is because there are many cases where you have to take responsibility and correct it even if it is not your own mistake due to unexpected events."
2302,39,0,40,ENTJ,22,"<no>  I think you have a lot of artistic inclinations. I enjoy doing a lot of painting, drawing, and other artistic activities."
2303,39,0,40,ENTJ,23,"<neutrality>  If you value reason over emotion, you won't have to fight fiercely with each other. But if you don't have feelings, it's hard to show warm consideration to others. I don't think the world would be a better place without those feelings."
2304,39,0,40,ENTJ,24,<Yes>  You want to get your chores or to-dos done first and then relax before going to bed. I hate being interrupted while doing something.
2305,39,0,40,ENTJ,25,"<no>  I think it's good to compromise opinions when arguing with each other, but most of them fight rather than compromise while arguing. So it's not fun to watch other people's arguments."
2306,39,0,40,ENTJ,26,"<neutrality>  want to be recognized by others for doing a good job, but I don't want to stand out by attracting other people's attention. There are many people who are envious and jealous when they do better than others or stand out."
2307,39,0,40,ENTJ,27,"<Yes>  Even if you are angry, if you hear something or a plausible reason, your anger will be relieved quickly."
2308,39,0,40,ENTJ,28,"<Yes>  I can only get things done in one go, but I get annoyed when I see people doing the same thing multiple times or making it happen. You end up having to do the same thing over and over again, wasting time and money."
2309,39,0,40,ENTJ,29,"<no>  Try to finish what needs to be done within the stipulated deadlines, if possible. It's because there are cases where you miss or forget over time."
2310,39,0,40,ENTJ,30,"<Yes>  I am interested in whether there is an afterlife. We also wonder if we should stop sinning and do good things for the sake of the afterlife, or whether in the afterlife we will receive the sins and punishments of the present life instead."
2311,39,0,40,ENTJ,31,"<Yes>  I prefer to spend time with others rather than alone. Whatever you do, it's more fun to do it together than alone."
2312,39,0,40,ENTJ,32,<Yes>  I think practice is more important than theory. So it's not easy to understand than you think by talking about the theory.
2313,39,0,40,ENTJ,33,"<neutrality> It's not easy to understand someone whose background is completely different from your own. However, there are many cases where I feel that because I come from a different background, I can act and think differently than I do."
2314,39,0,40,ENTJ,34,"<Yes>  Decision-making is postponed until the very end. In particular, if a decision affects a lot of people, I tend to make a decision carefully at the end after considering and thinking about various things as carefully as possible."
2315,39,0,40,ENTJ,35,<no>  I rethink a lot about decisions I've already made. I think a lot about whether that decision was the best and right decision or if there were no other decisions or methods.
2316,39,0,40,ENTJ,36,<neutrality>  Sometimes I enjoy my alone time. Sometimes I enjoy fun parties and events with many people.
2317,39,0,40,ENTJ,37,"<no>  I often go to art galleries and art exhibitions, but I don't enjoy or like looking at art or art."
2318,39,0,40,ENTJ,38,<no>  Understand other people's feelings. So I try to empathize with that person's feelings.
2319,39,0,40,ENTJ,39,<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos and always try to prioritize them and stick to them. I also like to make plans for work or personal things and put them into action.
2320,39,0,40,ENTJ,40,<no>  often feel insecure. It seems that I felt that emotion by experience rather than innate inclination.
2321,39,0,40,ENTJ,41,<Yes>  I don't want to inconvenience others by making phone calls. It's because I don't know if the person's details are good because I called.
2322,39,0,40,ENTJ,42,"<Yes> Everyone has different thoughts and opinions. Of course, it is not easy to convince others in a short time to understand my thoughts and opinions. It takes a lot of time and effort to understand the other person by listening to reasons and grounds."
2323,39,0,40,ENTJ,43,"<no>  Rather than contacting me to meet first, most of them contact me first and set the time they want to meet."
2324,39,0,40,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback to the plan, we prepare as much as possible and try to get back to the original plan."
2325,39,0,40,ENTJ,45,"<Yes>  When a long time ago mistake made a relationship break down, we often regret why we made such a decision or action at that time."
2326,39,0,40,ENTJ,46,"<no>  I think deeply about human existence and the reason for life. So, I worry a lot about how to live my life."
2327,39,0,40,ENTJ,47,"<neutrality>  I try to control my emotions, but sometimes I can't control them. The evaluation of the surroundings is the same."
2328,39,0,40,ENTJ,48,"<neutrality>  I point out the other person's mistakes, but if the other person is a family member or an elderly person, I try not to lose face to others. I do not wish to embarrass or embarrass myself with my intelligence."
2341,40,1,30,ISTP,1,"<Yes>  I tend to make new friends often. I like to travel to new cities, join new groups and meet new people with different perspectives."
2342,40,1,30,ISTP,2,"<Yes>  I spend a lot of time exploring my interests. My interests change often, but these days I like watching Netflix, cycling indoors, and doing yoga."
2343,40,1,30,ISTP,3,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I want to cry with the other person because I deeply sympathize with them, but there are times when I don't. I mainly want to soothe the other person who is sad by giving a logical explanation."
2344,40,1,30,ISTP,4,"<neutrality>  Depending on your priorities, you may or may not make preparations. I don't want to spend time making preparations for things that are not of high importance."
2345,40,1,30,ISTP,5,"<neutrality>  It's hard under pressure, but I tend to keep my composure well under pressure that I'm used to. For example, I tend to feel a little more secure about pressure questions in interviews than I did a few years ago."
2346,40,1,30,ISTP,6,<no>  I tend to talk mostly to people I already know at parties and events. It's because you feel more comfortable talking to someone you know first and then approaching someone new.
2347,40,1,30,ISTP,7,<no>  I tend to work on multiple projects at once. This is because working on just one project is boring and quickly loses focus.
2348,40,1,30,ISTP,8,"<neutrality>  Sometimes sentimental, sometimes completely insensitive. I get sentimental easily, mostly about things that have a lot to do with my situation, but not so much otherwise."
2349,40,1,30,ISTP,9,"<Yes> Especially when it comes to important things or big projects, I like to plan things out with a schedule or list. I usually make a plan by dividing it into daily, weekly, and monthly plans, write them on post-it notes, and stick them where I can see them often."
2350,40,1,30,ISTP,10,"<no>  I think small mistakes can happen to anyone. It's just a human side, and it's easy to get over it."
2351,40,1,30,ISTP,11,"<no>  The more interested you are, the harder it is to start a conversation first. I think it's because the fear of being rejected by the other person has grown."
2352,40,1,30,ISTP,12,<Yes>  I am not very interested in art works. Interpretation beyond what is just beautiful on the outside feels uninteresting.
2353,40,1,30,ISTP,13,"<neutrality>  It seems that it depends on the situation. I try to follow reason, but sometimes emotions take precedence. I am not very dependent on the opinions of those around me."
2354,40,1,30,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  I tend to pursue the pleasure of improvisation very much. Of course, important things have to be planned, but I feel comfortable making impromptu decisions and following them according to my mood or situation."
2355,40,1,30,ISTP,15,"<neutrality>  You may worry about how others will see you, but you may not. If it's something that's too important to me, I don't care much about other people's eyes."
2356,40,1,30,ISTP,16,"<neutrality>  Sometimes group activities are good, and sometimes individual activities are better. Group activities are usually better for hobbies, and it is more efficient to do things that require concentration alone."
2357,40,1,30,ISTP,17,"<no>  Books and movies with a clear ending are good. It's because a clear ending seems to teach me more lessons, so I enjoy reading mechanical development books these days."
2358,40,1,30,ISTP,18,"<no>  Frankly, I feel more satisfied with my own success. I am happy with the success of others, but I think it is more temporary than my success."
2359,40,1,30,ISTP,19,"<neutrality>  I have a lot of interests, but I tend to set my priorities clearly. It is most efficient to write important things mainly in bullet points."
2360,40,1,30,ISTP,20,"<no>  don't worry too much about things going wrong. It's because I believe that I can get through it even if it goes wrong, and the more I do it, the more confident I become."
2361,40,1,30,ISTP,21,"<neutrality>  I tend to only want to take responsibility for the things I like. Because when you're under pressure about things you don't know, you're more likely to get emotional with people."
2362,40,1,30,ISTP,22,"<Yes>  don't think I have much artistic inclination. Because I like things that are more substantial and tangible, and art feels a bit unreal to me."
2363,40,1,30,ISTP,23,"<Yes>  It is certain that the world will be a better place if reason is more important than emotion. Emotions are in the moment, and reason is to think with self-control, because the more you think and act, the more efficient and well-ordered communication between people is."
2364,40,1,30,ISTP,24,"<no>  When you are tired, the most important thing is to take a break. It doesn't matter if you do housework later, but if you don't take a break on time, the efficiency of everything including housework will decrease."
2365,40,1,30,ISTP,25,"<neutrality>  It's fun to watch people you don't know argue with, but you don't enjoy arguing with people close to you. It's because the closer I am, the more I feel my responsibility."
2366,40,1,30,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. It's because when I get attention, I tend to force myself to look better, which makes me feel a bit tired."
2367,40,1,30,ISTP,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change much except when I'm tired. I try to keep my emotions mostly neutral, and I tend to be that way."
2368,40,1,30,ISTP,28,"<no>  tend to understand people who are not efficient. There are many times when I am not like that, but I think I need to be encouraged the more I do."
2369,40,1,30,ISTP,29,"<Yes>  I almost always put things off until the end. Even recently, when deadlines are tight, I only finish work."
2370,40,1,30,ISTP,30,<no>  I am not very interested in questions about the afterlife. It's because I feel like it's not a real topic.
2371,40,1,30,ISTP,31,"<neutrality>  It's good to spend time with other people, but alone time is also important. Even these days, I enjoy social life by talking with friends and family, but I tend to keep my own time and space."
2372,40,1,30,ISTP,32,<Yes>  Theory-centered discussions and principled stories are not fun. It's because I think real experience is more realistic than books on any topic and you can learn a lot.
2373,40,1,30,ISTP,33,"<no>  It's not easy to empathize with someone else. To be honest, when I meet someone with a disposition that is opposite to my values, I tend to expand my point or just end the conversation."
2374,40,1,30,ISTP,34,"<Yes>  It's a bit indecisive, so I tend to put off making decisions a lot. When time is tight, I think it's easy to know what more I need."
2375,40,1,30,ISTP,35,"<no>  Even if I have already made a decision, I tend to think about it and find out if there is a better direction. I think it was because I had many experiences of regretting the decision."
2376,40,1,30,ISTP,36,"<neutrality>  Depending on the time, it's good to enjoy fun events, and it's good to rest alone. It's good to rest alone once or twice a month on weekends, and the rest I want to go to events outside to enjoy new things and meet people."
2377,40,1,30,ISTP,37,<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. It's because it's not easy to focus on the artwork itself.
2378,40,1,30,ISTP,38,<no>  I tend to understand other people's feelings easily. I usually read emotions well through the tone of voice or facial expression.
2379,40,1,30,ISTP,39,"<Yes>  tend to plan things to do the night before. This is because efficiency tends to increase from the morning, and even when there are too many things to do, priorities are created according to the plan made in advance."
2380,40,1,30,ISTP,40,"<no>  I tend to feel anxious. Personally, I think it's because I tend to throw myself into new environments a lot."
2381,40,1,30,ISTP,41,"<Yes>  don't like talking on the phone. It's because when an unexpected request comes, it's hard to think rationally while talking on the phone, and I'm tired of trying to adapt to the other person."
2382,40,1,30,ISTP,42,"<Yes>  To understand very different opinions, you must first understand someone else's background. Usually, the conservative notions of adults are accepted when you understand how they lived in the past and what parts were difficult."
2383,40,1,30,ISTP,43,"<no>  I'm used to being contacted by friends asking to meet up first. I think it's because when I get rejected, I'm very disappointed, but I'm also trying to do my best."
2384,40,1,30,ISTP,44,"<Yes>  I think that plans always change easily, so I try to go back quickly. I tend not to make plans that are too detailed from the start, and when the situation changes, I tend to quickly find other solutions."
2385,40,1,30,ISTP,45,<no>  I don't think too much about my old mistakes. I tend to focus more on future actions that I learned from my mistakes.
2386,40,1,30,ISTP,46,"<neutrality>  I think about the reason for living sometimes, but it seems to change often. I think it's because I'm more focused on what's happening right now."
2387,40,1,30,ISTP,47,"<neutrality> He controls his emotions well, but when he's tired, he's easily swayed and follows him. Especially when the other person gets angry because of me, I usually apologize, but when I'm tired, I just feel sad and frustrated."
2388,40,1,30,ISTP,48,<Yes>  I try to keep my confidence while telling the other person what I did wrong. It's because I make mistakes often and I want to be treated the same way.
2401,41,1,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  don't feel the need to make new friends because I like being at home, and sometimes it's hard to make new friends in an unfamiliar place."
2402,41,1,30,ISTJ,2,"<neutrality>  Interested in exploring interests, but not diverse. Lately, I've been very interested in cooking."
2403,41,1,30,ISTJ,3,"<no>  I wonder why this person is crying, but I don't feel like crying either."
2404,41,1,30,ISTJ,4,"<neutrality>  can't make preparations when I'm busy, but if I have a lot of free time, I tend to make preparations. It's because when things go wrong, you have to have a workaround to put your mind at ease."
2405,41,1,30,ISTJ,5,"<Yes>  Even when I'm working, I'm calm enough to be depended on by people around me, and I do my job while maintaining my composure even when the pressure is severe."
2406,41,1,30,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  I don't like crowded places and it's difficult to meet new people in an unfamiliar place, so I tend to talk mostly to people I know."
2407,41,1,30,ISTJ,7,"<neutrality>  When I'm working, I finish one thing and then do another, but I'm usually tired of doing one thing consistently, so I tend to start several and complete them in a planned way."
2408,41,1,30,ISTJ,8,"<no>  Even when conversing with others, they are not sentimental because they try to find solutions or problems rather than empathize."
2409,41,1,30,ISTJ,9,"<Yes> When I buy a diary, I like to make plans and to-do lists, and I like to make plans when I travel."
2410,41,1,30,ISTJ,10,"<Yes>  Since I left work after work, I tend to blame myself a lot because I remember the mistakes I made."
2411,41,1,30,ISTJ,11,"<no>  I find it hard to talk to, even people I'm interested in, and I feel uncomfortable talking to strangers."

2415,41,1,30,ISTJ,15,"<no>  tend to worry a lot about how I look to others, and if I make a mistake during a conversation, I keep thinking about it and blaming myself even after I go home."
2416,41,1,30,ISTJ,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy group activities, and I rarely attend things like dinners and club activities."
2417,41,1,30,ISTJ,17,"<no>  After seeing the ending of a movie or book, I wonder why it ends like this, but I don't interpret the way it ended in a different way."
2418,41,1,30,ISTJ,18,<no>  am not satisfied with helping others succeed because I am more interested in my own success than in helping others succeed.
2419,41,1,30,ISTJ,19,<no>  You never know what to do because you don't have many interests.
2420,41,1,30,ISTJ,20,"<Yes>  During and after work, I tend to worry a lot about what to do if I get scolded tomorrow. The reason seems to be that I don't like being scolded very much."
2421,41,1,30,ISTJ,21,<Yes>  would like to avoid taking on a leadership role because I am more comfortable listening to and acting on what the leader has to say.
2422,41,1,30,ISTJ,22,"<Yes>  I like to draw, but I don't think I have artistic inclinations because I know I don't have artistic talent."
2423,41,1,30,ISTJ,23,<Yes>  There are times when I think that there would have been better results if I had judged a little more rationally because I have seen many cases where I borrowed money for emotional reasons and did not receive it.
2424,41,1,30,ISTJ,24,"<no>  I value rest more, so I tend to do housework after I take a break rather than finish it first."
2425,41,1,30,ISTJ,25,"<neutrality>  I don't like to see arguments that seem like they're fighting each other, but I like to see arguments that are productive."
2426,41,1,30,ISTJ,26,"<Yes> When someone expresses an opinion, I tend not to draw attention to it because I think it will attract other people's attention if I express a different opinion."
2427,41,1,30,ISTJ,27,<no>  I don't think my emotions change so much that people around me say that I am calm.
2428,41,1,30,ISTJ,28,"<Yes>  When I'm at work, I sometimes get annoyed when I see other people doing their work inefficiently."
2429,41,1,30,ISTJ,29,"<no>  have had a hard time procrastinating and doing it all at once, so I tend to solve things quickly if I have time."
2430,41,1,30,ISTJ,30,<no>  I am not interested in questions about the afterlife because I think death is the end.
2431,41,1,30,ISTJ,31,<no>  I prefer to spend time alone rather than spending time with other people.
2432,41,1,30,ISTJ,32,"<Yes> When I listen to lectures, I think theories and theories are boring because I prefer to talk about the core rather than theories and principles."
2433,41,1,30,ISTJ,33,<no>  It seems that I am not easily able to empathize with others because the environment I have lived in has made it difficult to empathize with others when I have a conversation with them.

2437,41,1,30,ISTJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't go to art galleries, but I like seeing art works that I see once in a while."
2438,41,1,30,ISTJ,38,"<neutrality>  tend to sympathize with things that have similar experiences to mine, but I am not good at empathizing with things that I do not understand."
2439,41,1,30,ISTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to write personal things in my diary and put them into action, and I like to plan things when I'm working."
2440,41,1,30,ISTJ,40,"<no>  I don't show anxiety in front of others, but I tend to feel anxious when I'm alone. It seems that you feel insecure as you start working."
2441,41,1,30,ISTJ,41,"<Yes>  He's not very empathetic, so he seems to want to avoid talking over the phone."
2442,41,1,30,ISTJ,42,"<no>  Even if my opinion is very different, I don't spend a lot of time thinking that other people's opinions can be too."
2443,41,1,30,ISTJ,43,"<no>  Because I like my alone time, I tend not to contact my friends first, and I tend to meet them when they do."

2445,41,1,30,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  When I make a mistake and see a similar situation on TV, there are times when I regret my mistake long ago because I remember what happened then."
2446,41,1,30,ISTJ,46,<no>  I don't think I've thought deeply about human existence and the reason for living because I'm busy living now.
2447,41,1,30,ISTJ,47,"<neutrality>  I think I tend to get swayed by my emotions when I get really angry, but people around me seem to be the type to hear that I seem to be good at controlling my emotions."
2448,41,1,30,ISTJ,48,"<no>  If there is something wrong with the other person, I think I need to correct it, so I tend to talk about it rather than save face."
2461,42,1,40,ISFJ,1,<no>  don't make new friends. The reason is that you don't have the energy to spend on meeting new people right now.
2462,42,1,40,ISFJ,2,<Yes>  I spend a lot of time. The reason is that I do a lot of research on data labeling and am actively participating in education.
2463,42,1,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  I almost cry. The reason is because I sympathize with other people's feelings a lot, and my heart hurts together."
2464,42,1,40,ISFJ,4,<Yes>  tend to build. The reason is that there are always cases where things don't go as I planned.
2465,42,1,40,ISFJ,5,"<Yes>  I am good at maintaining. This is because we recently calmly and calmly said what we had to say and brought the results in the direction we wanted in a meeting with a confrontational situation with the principal, vice-principal, and other executives and parents of the child's school."
2466,42,1,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  talk to people I know. The reason is because I have a shy personality, so I feel comfortable talking to people I know."
2467,42,1,40,ISFJ,7,"<Yes>  I'm kind of like that. When it comes to data labeling projects, you can start another project only after the one you've been working on is over."
2468,42,1,40,ISFJ,8,"<no>  This is because I am a rational person, so I think very realistically and try to understand the situation."
2469,42,1,40,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  i like it If I always keep my diary by my side and write down and manage schedules and to-dos, I tend to be in charge of making plans such as travel."
2470,42,1,40,ISFJ,10,"<neutrality>  I doubt and support me. Last year, when I was working on a long-term labeling project, I was pointed out, but I thought I was too lacking in ability."
2471,42,1,40,ISFJ,11,"<neutrality>  I think it's difficult and I think it's not. The reason is that it is exciting and scary until you approach it, but I think it is not difficult if you approach it with your mind."
2472,42,1,40,ISFJ,12,<Yes>  I am currently not interested. Because I don't have the energy right now to interpret and discuss the artwork.
2473,42,1,40,ISFJ,13,"<Yes>  always try to judge rationally, and I think I actually judge that way, but some people around me seem to think that I am emotional."
2474,42,1,40,ISFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I always live with a plan and don't deviate from the big picture, but there are times when I want to travel or just improvise for a day or so. However, impromptu should be impromptu today, and I eat my mind and bake impromptu."
2475,42,1,40,ISFJ,15,"<neutrality>  don't think I care about other people's eyes, but when I hear evaluations or gossip, I do care. When I was at the company, I hated the gossip of the employees."
2476,42,1,40,ISFJ,16,"<neutrality>  I seem to have participated and enjoyed it a lot in the past, but these days it feels like a nuisance."
2477,42,1,40,ISFJ,17,<no>  I prefer works that have an ending. I've been having a lot of fun with Brokers lately.
2478,42,1,40,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I used to be like that. I worked hard for the success of others, but now I have a desire to succeed first."
2479,42,1,40,ISFJ,19,"<no>  When I focus on one thing, I tend not to look at the others. I am currently only interested in data labeling work."
2480,42,1,40,ISFJ,20,"<neutrality>  Originally, I have a very positive disposition, but these days things don't go the way I want, so I'm a little worried."
2481,42,1,40,ISFJ,21,"<Yes>  I live my life independently, so I don't want to take responsibility and play a leadership role even in a group."
2482,42,1,40,ISFJ,22,"<neutrality>  I don't think there are any at all. Because I am good at dancing and singing, I like art works, and I like seeing art exhibitions."
2483,42,1,40,ISFJ,23,<neutrality>  I believe that emotion and reason coexist and balance to make the world a better place.
2484,42,1,40,ISFJ,24,"<Yes>  absolutely have to finish first. It's because when you rest at home, if you don't finish your housework and rest, it feels like you're not resting even if you rest. I think I have to do that with my head, and I get stressed out."
2485,42,1,40,ISFJ,25,<neutrality>  I think it's interesting to discuss topics that I'm interested in rather than expressing fun.
2486,42,1,40,ISFJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't like to stand out very much. If you look at me normally, yes."
2487,42,1,40,ISFJ,27,"<neutrality> When I get into a fight or get angry, my emotions seem to change quickly. For example, if you get angry with your child and turn around, you immediately regret it."
2488,42,1,40,ISFJ,28,"<neutrality>  I don't get annoyed at all, but when I'm working, I get annoyed when I get hurt because of that person."
2489,42,1,40,ISFJ,29,"<no>  I tend to do what I have to do first and then rest. Right now, when I open my eyes in the morning for labeling, I start my day by finishing all the things I need to do for the day."
2490,42,1,40,ISFJ,30,<no>  I am not very interested in the world after death. It's because it's daunting just to do your best in life right now.
2491,42,1,40,ISFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I enjoy being with other people, but these days I think I need some time alone."
2492,42,1,40,ISFJ,32,"<neutrality>  When I see discussions on TV or in places like this, the topics I am interested in are interesting and the topics I am not interested in are boring."
2493,42,1,40,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I don't think background has any effect on empathy. It doesn't matter if that person fits me or not. Even though people from so many different backgrounds came together on the issue of children's schools, we could fully sympathize with one consensus."
2494,42,1,40,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  If the matter to be decided requires a quick decision, I judge quickly, think carefully, and if it is a matter that needs to be taken slowly, I postpone it until the end."
2495,42,1,40,ISFJ,35,<Yes>  I'm just trying to be the best choice rather than dwelling on the decisions I've already made.
2496,42,1,40,ISFJ,36,"<no>  I used to like parties and events, but these days I spend time alone or with my family."
2497,42,1,40,ISFJ,37,<Yes>  I like to go to art galleries and see art. I especially like Van Gogh.
2498,42,1,40,ISFJ,38,"<no>  tend to empathize with the feelings of others. Even if it's a different person from me, I think that person can do that."
2499,42,1,40,ISFJ,39,"<Yes>  I plan my to-dos for each day, week, and month, and I spend my day and schedule according to that plan."
2500,42,1,40,ISFJ,40,"<no>  I feel a lot of insecurity. I seem to have a natural tendency, and I have a lot of anxiety about things that I can't do on my own."
2501,42,1,40,ISFJ,41,<Yes>  would like to proceed by e-mail if possible in case of business contact other than family or close acquaintances. I'm not sure why. It just makes me feel comfortable.
2502,42,1,40,ISFJ,42,"<no>  I try to understand, and when I understand, I understand, but I don't have to spend a lot of time to understand it."
2503,42,1,40,ISFJ,43,"<neutrality>  I contact you first when it's a friend's birthday or when a friend needs comfort, but I'm not the type to contact you first."
2504,42,1,40,ISFJ,44,"<neutrality>  I'll do it if it's a plan that allows me to get back to it quickly, but if I can't get back to it, I try to find the best other option."
2505,42,1,40,ISFJ,45,<Yes>  I often regret mistakes made long ago. The reason is that mistakes affect my life now.
2506,42,1,40,ISFJ,46,"<no>  I'm not very good at thinking like that. When you live a busy life every day, you don't have time to think about that."
2507,42,1,40,ISFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I tend to try to control. But sometimes I get swayed, and people around me seem to think similarly to me."
2508,42,1,40,ISFJ,48,"<no>  I am a person who is not good at compromise when it comes to right and wrong, so even in such a case, I do not try to save the face of the other person."
2521,43,1,30,ISTP,1,<no>  I don't feel the need to make new friends. It's because I don't meet my old friends often.
2522,43,1,30,ISTP,2,"<neutrality>  I spend my free time exploring my interests, but not diverse. Lately I've been concentrating on making and eating Greek yogurt."
2523,43,1,30,ISTP,3,"<no>  I don't cry when other people cry. I wonder why that person is crying, and I only listen to sympathize with them."
2524,43,1,30,ISTP,4,"<neutrality>  I don't make preparations in everyday life, but I do when I'm working. It's because I don't like to be responsible for my work because there are variables."
2525,43,1,30,ISTP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to keep my composure. Recently, a buyer came from abroad and I had something to respond to, and I finished the job without incident."
2526,43,1,30,ISTP,6,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I introduce myself and sometimes I don't. It depends on the type of event, but I tend to introduce myself at daily events."
2527,43,1,30,ISTP,7,<no>  tend to work on multiple projects at the same time. I like to work on multiple projects at the same time because concentrating on just one project tends to lose my concentration.
2528,43,1,30,ISTP,8,<no>  I don't think it's sentimental. I get a lot of compliments from people around me that I have an objective side.
2529,43,1,30,ISTP,9,"<neutrality>  I don't plan my personal schedule well, but I tend to make a list and work at work. I tend to only write big plans in my personal diary."
2530,43,1,30,ISTP,10,"<no>  don't mistake my abilities. I made a mistake while working, but I just thought it might be and moved on."
2531,43,1,30,ISTP,11,<neutrality>  It's not difficult to approach and start a conversation. But I tend not to do it unless I have to.
2532,43,1,30,ISTP,12,<Yes>  I am not interested in debating the different interpretations of works of art. I am not very interested in art and there is nothing to discuss.
2533,43,1,30,ISTP,13,"<Yes> In general, I tend to follow reason. I'm hearing reviews that say that in general."
2534,43,1,30,ISTP,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to make big plans and improvise specific plans within them. Even when I go on a trip, I only decide on 1-2 things I really want to do, and decide on the rest as I go."
2535,43,1,30,ISTP,15,"<neutrality>  I worry about what kind of person I will look, but I don't make it big. I think that not everyone can like me, so I try not to worry."
2536,43,1,30,ISTP,16,"<neutrality>  I sometimes participate in group activities, but I don't find them myself. It has decreased even more since Corona."
2537,43,1,30,ISTP,17,"<Yes>  I tend to like books and movies where the ending can be freely interpreted. Recently, I liked Tenet and watched it several times, and that's why."
2538,43,1,30,ISTP,18,<no>  I feel no satisfaction in helping others succeed. I think it's because I feel that my efforts are not recognized.
2539,43,1,30,ISTP,19,<no>  I never have too many interests and I don't know what to do next. I tend to focus on a few things.
2540,43,1,30,ISTP,20,"<neutrality>  I was worried that things might go wrong, but I don't these days. I¡¯m the type of person who tries not to worry because I know that worrying won¡¯t change anything."
2541,43,1,30,ISTP,21,"<neutrality>  don't like the leadership role, but I don't avoid it. I have to do it, but I don't want to be a leader."
2542,43,1,30,ISTP,22,<Yes>  I have very little artistic inclination. I tend to like work with clear answers rather than art.
2543,43,1,30,ISTP,23,"<no>  I don't think a world that values reason over emotion is a better world. If people had been rational during this heavy rain, they would have evacuated themselves instead of helping others."
2544,43,1,30,ISTP,24,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I finish my chores before taking a break, sometimes I don't. I like to finish things, but there are times when I procrastinate as much as I can because I'm too lazy."
2545,43,1,30,ISTP,25,<Yes>  I like to look at other people's arguments. Fighting with logic is fun.
2546,43,1,30,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. Even if the other person tells you wrong information, you tend to just ignore it."
2547,43,1,30,ISTP,27,"<no>  Emotions don't change very quickly. Even if I failed the company interview or the exam, I wasn¡¯t too sad."
2548,43,1,30,ISTP,28,"<no>  I don't get very annoyed when I see people who aren't efficient. When I see the people I work with work inefficiently, I just tend to do it."
2549,43,1,30,ISTP,29,"<neutrality>  I put off personal work, but I do company work as soon as possible. I finished the work that had to be done by next month in 3 days."
2550,43,1,30,ISTP,30,<no>  I don't think the question of the afterlife is interesting. Because there is no afterlife.
2551,43,1,30,ISTP,31,"<neutrality>  Most of the time I like to be alone, but lately I tend to have gatherings. I'm meeting friends I haven't seen due to Corona."
2552,43,1,30,ISTP,32,<no>  I am interested in theory-oriented discussions and principled stories. I like to hear stories about topics I don't know.
2553,43,1,30,ISTP,33,<Yes>  They easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds. I am good at communicating with older people.
2554,43,1,30,ISTP,34,"<no>  Decisions are made quickly rather than delayed. It's because no matter how long you think about it, you won't make a better decision."
2555,43,1,30,ISTP,35,<Yes>  I tend not to reconsider decisions I have already made. It's because I think that nothing will change by thinking again.
2556,43,1,30,ISTP,36,"<no>  don't relieve the fatigue of the week with parties or events. These days, alone time is essential."
2557,43,1,30,ISTP,37,"<neutrality>  I like going to art galleries, but I don't go often. I like it, but I also think it's a waste of time."
2558,43,1,30,ISTP,38,<no>  There are times when it is difficult to understand other people's feelings. I always think that I could be that way about other people's actions.
2559,43,1,30,ISTP,39,"<no>  don't like to plan things. I don't like it, but I need it for my work, so I make a plan."
2560,43,1,30,ISTP,40,<Yes>  I rarely feel anxious. It's because I don't think there's a law that people die.
2561,43,1,30,ISTP,41,<no>  I don't avoid making phone calls. It's because it's not difficult to make a phone call.
2562,43,1,30,ISTP,42,<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. I guess I'm just that kind of person and move on.
2563,43,1,30,ISTP,43,"<neutrality>  I tend to contact friends I don't see often asking to meet up first, but I don't contact friends I see often. See you when I get in touch."
2564,43,1,30,ISTP,44,"<no>  If the plan goes wrong, I don't try to undo it. The business trip schedule was off, but I just made a new plan and proceeded."
2565,43,1,30,ISTP,45,"<neutrality> There are times when I regret the mistakes of a long time ago, but not many. I think it would have been nice to have bought it before the house price went up, but I try not to think too deeply."
2566,43,1,30,ISTP,46,<Yes>  I tend not to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. Because I think there is no answer.
2567,43,1,30,ISTP,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions. There is no emotional ups and downs enough to be swayed by emotions, and those around you evaluate it as such."
2568,43,1,30,ISTP,48,"<Yes> Even when it's obvious that it's the other person's fault, I tend to save the other person's face. Because I could make that mistake too."
2581,44,1,40,INFP,1,"<Yes>  When working or learning and encountering a new field or environment, I make new friends in it. It is interesting to meet people with the characteristics of each field."
2582,44,1,40,INFP,2,"<Yes> Dedicated to exploring a variety of interests. AI field, history of lifelong education, acquisition of computer literacy certificate, video editing, alternative medicine, product making with natural aroma, making furniture with Korean paper craft, visiting restaurants, finding good scenery without tourists, etc."
2583,44,1,40,INFP,3,"<no>  When someone else is crying, they wonder why. It's because crying doesn't solve everything and resolve it."
2584,44,1,40,INFP,4,"<Yes>  Since nothing is 100% successful, I tend to make preparations. Because when things go wrong, they can be dealt with quickly."
2585,44,1,40,INFP,5,"<Yes>  I try to keep my composure so as not to lose objectivity. I was under a lot of pressure ahead of this last important exam, but I thought about how this last exam would affect me for the rest of my life."
2586,44,1,40,INFP,6,"<Yes>  It's a place with a lot of people, so I prefer to talk to people I know rather than introduce myself first. It feels more comfortable."
2587,44,1,40,INFP,7,<no>  There are some differences depending on the nature of the project. You may start another project right before you fully complete one.
2588,44,1,40,INFP,8,"<no>  It's not very sentimental. Depending on what is going on, sometimes a sentimental side emerges."
2589,44,1,40,INFP,9,<Yes>  Various schedules occur to make plans. I habitually use a diary or website to manage my schedule.
2590,44,1,40,INFP,10,<Yes>  Conversation with people on social media Sentence typos are suspicious. I occasionally find typos in basic sentences.
2591,44,1,40,INFP,11,"<Yes>  If you are interested, many questions will arise. It's not very easy, but sometimes I muster up the courage to step up and start a conversation."
2592,44,1,40,INFP,12,"<no>  Known or not, I am interested in discussing the various interpretations of works of art. It's just a pity that I can't discuss it in depth because I lack common sense."
2593,44,1,40,INFP,13,"<Yes>  I usually follow reason rather than emotion. There is an emotional part, but the head is ahead of the heart, and the evaluations of the people around are similar."
2594,44,1,40,INFP,14,"<Yes>  I often improvise within a big framework. Even if I made a meal appointment a long time ago, I make a decision based on the location, menu, or the timing."
2595,44,1,40,INFP,15,"<Yes> In the past, I was curious and worried about how others would look at me, but that's not the case now. After a lot of worrying about myself and self-reflection, my worries decreased."
2596,44,1,40,INFP,16,"<no>  Participation in group activities has decreased significantly compared to before. These days, I prefer gatherings of a small number of people rather than groups."
2597,44,1,40,INFP,17,"<Yes>  I tend to like movies where I try to think in various ways and interpret them in my own way. Among the movies I recently screened, 'Decision to Break Up' was really good."
2598,44,1,40,INFP,18,<Yes>  There is a great sense of satisfaction when you help others achieve success. I am happy when I see other people happy when they see me.
2599,44,1,40,INFP,19,"<Yes>  I'm usually very interested in this and that, so sometimes I don't know what to do. I was planning to make use of my free time, but the list was too long."
2600,44,1,40,INFP,20,<no>  don't worry enough to think about it before I start work. Reduce errors and prevent wrongdoing with sufficient consideration.
2601,44,1,40,INFP,21,"<Yes>  The group's leader has a lot going on and decides, which he wants to avoid as much as possible. I want to live a comfortable group life with less responsibility and weight as a leader."
2602,44,1,40,INFP,22,<no>  Sometimes artistic tendencies show up. I actively participated in performance activities for a while and received good reviews.
2603,44,1,40,INFP,23,"<no>  For a better world, I think that both reason and emotion should be appropriate. I don't think it's good to have a world that leans towards one thing."
2604,44,1,40,INFP,24,"<Yes>  If possible, I want to take a break. It is better to take as much rest as you want without worrying about the rest."
2605,44,1,40,INFP,25,"<Yes> Sometimes I watch the debate and soothe my boredom. As long as it's not very deep and serious, there's a lot of fun to learn from and learn from the debate."
2606,44,1,40,INFP,26,"<Yes>  Sometimes it's okay, but I don't feel the need to get other people's attention often. Whether or not I attract others' attention, I judge what's important to me inside myself."
2607,44,1,40,INFP,27,"<Yes>  Emotions usually change very quickly. Rather than staying in one emotion over one situation, I feel that various emotions change from time to time."
2608,44,1,40,INFP,28,"<Yes>  It's not harsh, but I get annoyed when I see people who aren't efficient. It's simple and basic common sense, but when the other person doesn't know more about the part that I can't handle because of lack of common sense, I feel a decrease in efficiency and get annoyed."
2609,44,1,40,INFP,29,"<Yes>  There are many times when I put off work until the end even though I am bothered by it. Lately, when I feel that I have a lot of free time, I seem to be putting it off until the end."
2610,44,1,40,INFP,30,"<Yes>  Very occasionally, I find questions about the afterlife interesting. The present is more interesting than the afterlife, but sometimes I think questions about the afterlife are also interesting."
2611,44,1,40,INFP,31,<Yes>  Very occasionally you just want to spend time with someone else. Most like to spend time alone.
2612,44,1,40,INFP,32,<Yes>  am not interested in theoretical discussions and I am bored with principled stories. This is not an age where theory-centered discussions or principled stories can all be accommodated.
2613,44,1,40,INFP,33,"<Yes>  You can empathize with someone from a completely different background. Through various experiences and learning, I was able to develop my empathy and served as a counselor."
2614,44,1,40,INFP,34,"<Yes> Whenever possible, we try to make decisions as late as possible. It will depend on the case, but if there is a risk, we will make a decision after considering it as carefully as possible."
2615,44,1,40,INFP,35,<Yes>  Decisions are not rethought. I focus on the progress because it was thoroughly considered before making a decision.
2616,44,1,40,INFP,36,<no>  The fatigue of the week is trying to spend time alone if possible. I try to do something I wanted to do that I was interested in quietly alone.
2617,44,1,40,INFP,37,"<Yes>  like the act of watching. I love to appreciate art, plays, and performances."
2618,44,1,40,INFP,38,"<no>  It's not hard to understand other people's feelings. I understand, but I don't want to be emotional, and I'm not agitated."
2619,44,1,40,INFP,39,"<Yes>  Plan your daily to-dos. It's become a habit and I'm enjoying it like a game, so I'm planning my work and personal schedules and I'm liking it."
2620,44,1,40,INFP,40,"<Yes> Very occasionally, I feel insecure. As I have experienced many things in my life, I have a little bit of anxiety that I didn't have before."
2621,44,1,40,INFP,41,"<Yes>  There's nothing objectionable about making calls, but I'd like to avoid it if possible. After experiencing phone counseling, I sometimes think of outbound counseling when I make a phone call."
2622,44,1,40,INFP,42,"<Yes> If you don't understand very different opinions that you don't expect, you spend a lot of time very occasionally. A long time ago, during a conversation with an acquaintance, I spent a lot of time not understanding the opinions that differed from mine."
2623,44,1,40,INFP,43,"<Yes>  I usually do all contact. When a goal arises in a conversation, it executes the goal most quickly."
2624,44,1,40,INFP,44,"<Yes>  Plans that have been disrupted are rectified as soon as possible. I have an experience in which a schedule that was planned to be carried out by several people was misaligned, and one person grasped the situation and proceeded according to the original plan."
2625,44,1,40,INFP,45,"<no>  I tend not to regret it. However, as there are more things to pay attention to health these days, there are times when I think of the mistakes and things I did not fulfill even though I knew it a long time ago, and sometimes I regret it."
2626,44,1,40,INFP,46,"<no>  Sometimes I think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. If you think about the reason for your existence and life, you will have energy and lead a more passionate life."
2627,44,1,40,INFP,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions rather than being swayed by them. Even if a conflict arises, we manage to reduce the conflict without being swayed by emotions."
2628,44,1,40,INFP,48,"<Yes>  Whenever possible, try to save face even when it is obvious that the other person is at fault. If you save face, you will make fewer mistakes and change in a good direction out of gratitude."
2641,45,1,30,ENTJ,1,"<no> I'm not trying to make friends. I tend to let it flow. Even if it's not your new friends, there are people to play with."
2642,45,1,30,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, I'm interested in electronics, so I'm very interested in fixing a broken TV."
2643,45,1,30,ENTJ,3,"<no>  If your partner is crying, you just find out the reason and suggest a solution. If it's not that, I'll just stay by your side, but I won't interfere or comfort you."
2644,45,1,30,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  It would be nice if the plan went as planned, but I know it's difficult, so I usually make three predictions: the best option, the next best solution, and the worst-case scenario."
2645,45,1,30,ENTJ,5,"<Yes> By self-suggesting that you are riding a wave, you focus more on the task. There was a time when I even embraced someone else's work, but since solving is more important than criticism, it was resolved quickly by concentrating on making a plan sequentially."
2646,45,1,30,ENTJ,6,"<Yes>  Even if you only talk to people you already know, new people often become friends after a while."
2647,45,1,30,ENTJ,7,"<Yes> It is difficult to focus on one thing if you do many things at once, and all projects can get tangled up with a momentary mistake or fall into a slump. . There was no distraction, it was faster and the perfection was high."
2648,45,1,30,ENTJ,8,"<no>  It's about being grateful for the little things. I tend to try to be sentimental, but it's not easy because I seem to be wearing a false mask."
2649,45,1,30,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  Group plans tend to be self-inflicted because what others are doing is not satisfying. The plan to be shared is either an Excel file or an electronic device. Personally, I tend to write my plans on paper. This is because you can outline faster than you can only do in your head."
2650,45,1,30,ENTJ,10,"<no> We see small mistakes as opportunities to correct them. Small things don't become big things, I'm glad that I made up for it when it was small, and I try not to make repeated mistakes."
2651,45,1,30,ENTJ,11,"<neutrality>  It's not difficult to have a conversation if you're new to it, but don't start talking unless it's out of necessity. If you are interested, you may be interested, but I tend to talk first to people who are alienated from the group or to the elderly who seem to be in trouble."
2652,45,1,30,ENTJ,12,"<Yes>  I like to interpret the work in various ways, but not to the point of discussion."
2653,45,1,30,ENTJ,13,"<Yes>  For me, confrontation without distortion is the best way, and I sometimes hear that I am cold-hearted by acquaintances around me, and there are times when I hear that I am mean, depending on the opponent."
2654,45,1,30,ENTJ,14,"<no>  There will be things you must do during the day, things you need to do first, but I think it's enough to spend time improvising after processing them first."
2655,45,1,30,ENTJ,15,"<Yes>  If you have an important job in an important position, you will make an effort for a certain amount of prestige, but if that is not the case, I think you should be satisfied within the line that is not excessive and not insufficient."
2656,45,1,30,ENTJ,16,"<Yes>  It almost disappeared after the corona, but before that, I felt alive and energized and had a lot of positive influence."
2657,45,1,30,ENTJ,17,"<no>  It's often said that the ending is open, but I think, 'Is the material exhausted?"
2658,45,1,30,ENTJ,18,"<no>  I can always share my success with others, but how long will that person stay with me after helping others succeed? Human relationships don't last a lifetime."
2659,45,1,30,ENTJ,19,"<no>  Even if there are many interests, they are all different, and there are restrictions depending on the environment, so the order is easy to decide. On this basis, large-volume furniture, home appliances, books, and electric machines were purchased or rented."
2660,45,1,30,ENTJ,20,<no>  Worrying doesn't change the outcome. Just take one more look ahead and be prepared for any unforeseen troubles.
2661,45,1,30,ENTJ,21,"<no> There are a lot of things that other people do that bother my eyes, and I tend to do it myself because I don't get offended."
2662,45,1,30,ENTJ,22,"<no>  I don't like stereotypes, so I draw or create in any direction I want. They say or act on their thoughts in a way that does not cause harm to those around them. The other day, I went to learn furniture making and got a scouting offer."
2663,45,1,30,ENTJ,23,"<Yes> Modern people have a lot of emotional attitudes, and it is common to appeal to emotions rather than trying to solve something. Of course, humans are not robots, so we shouldn't be without emotions, but I think it's excessive now."
2664,45,1,30,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  If you put your work aside and rest, it's hard to rest properly because you care about it."
2665,45,1,30,ENTJ,25,"<Yes>  It is better to give your opinion and justify it than to be blind. Showing willpower and belief seems to have a sense of responsibility. Instead, you must also learn to admit that you are not."
2666,45,1,30,ENTJ,26,"<no>  It doesn't matter if you get other people's attention or not. It's just an environment that can happen when I say or do what I want, but I don't attach any meaning to it."
2667,45,1,30,ENTJ,27,<no>  I have yet to experience any event or factor that would change my emotions very quickly.
2668,45,1,30,ENTJ,28,"<Yes> Not being efficient is slow and of course annoying at the thought of going back. If you look a little more or seek help around you, you can reduce everyone's work."
2669,45,1,30,ENTJ,29,<no>  It is unacceptable to postpone work until the end. It is processed in advance and only corrected for the better for the rest of the period.
2670,45,1,30,ENTJ,30,"<no>  Sometimes I wonder, but I don't think they exist. Since there is no reality, it cannot be verified."
2671,45,1,30,ENTJ,31,"<Yes> There is still a lot to learn and realize through communication, and distracting thoughts disappear and stress is relieved."
2672,45,1,30,ENTJ,32,"<no>  Because the present exists because there is a past, it often stimulates curiosity about how something started, changed, and evolved. Theory-based discussions tend to focus on areas of interest where there is some evidence."
2673,45,1,30,ENTJ,33,"<Yes> The environmental factors in which the opponent is placed understand the other person in a cross-sectional way through similar experiences, and suggest ways or communicate on the line of knowledge. Emotional empathy is difficult."
2674,45,1,30,ENTJ,34,"<no>  After setting the frame to make a decision in the best way, I gather information, think about the outcome in various ways, and then decide when I am satisfied. If you have time left after making a decision, take the time to prepare for the consequences."
2675,45,1,30,ENTJ,35,"<Yes> Rather than overturning or murmuring over decisions already made, we strive to make quick progress so that there are no setbacks in our decisions."
2676,45,1,30,ENTJ,36,<Yes>  I think it's a good way to relieve mental fatigue and have a healthy mind even if the body gets more tired.
2677,45,1,30,ENTJ,37,"<Yes>  I like it, but I'm not looking for it. There are times when the same work looks different depending on the mood at the time, and there are times when I am attracted to things that look warm or cold."
2678,45,1,30,ENTJ,38,"<Yes>  It is said that each person has a different weight, but there are times when you think, 'Is it really necessary to react like this?'"
2679,45,1,30,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  If you don't do it step by step, the rhythm can be broken when you are in an unexpected situation, so set a date or time zone for important tasks and ensure that they are handled at a fixed time."
2680,45,1,30,ENTJ,40,"<Yes>  There is no one who does not feel insecure. If it is a series of situations in which I am responsible for the decisions I have made due to the environment, I will check it once more at an anxious time, prepare to humbly accept the results, and repeat learning to prepare for the next one."
2681,45,1,30,ENTJ,41,<no>  I think it's necessary to make a phone call unless it's a specific notice text message or private conversation with close acquaintances.
2682,45,1,30,ENTJ,42,"<Yes>  You are free to express your opinion, and if you have a different opinion, there may be reasons and information for that opinion. But it depends on who your opponent is. Excluding those who insist on insistence and those who are stubborn."
2683,45,1,30,ENTJ,43,"<Yes> If you want to see it, contact me to see it. When the time is right, we meet on the same day, and if it is not possible, we make an appointment as soon as possible."
2684,45,1,30,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  It is first to check the place where the problem occurred, and it is a waste to cut off the place where the problem occurred."
2685,45,1,30,ENTJ,45,"<no>  I always write it in order not to repeat the same mistake, but I can't go back even if I regret it. I regard it as my own indicator."
2686,45,1,30,ENTJ,46,"<Yes>  Rather than grandiose thoughts like human existence, sometimes the reason why I have to live, the reason for existence, and the extent to which I find my place."
2687,45,1,30,ENTJ,47,"<no>  I don't show deep emotions, and I've never been told I'm emotional by people I know."
2688,45,1,30,ENTJ,48,"<no>  After taking responsibility for the wrongdoing, I think it's okay to go there and save face depending on the situation."
2701,46,1,30,ENFJ,1,"<neutrality>  I used to make a lot, but as I get older, there are more and more people to take care of, so I don't make as many now as before."
2702,46,1,30,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  I am preparing for marriage, so I spend a lot of time searching for information about marriage."
2703,46,1,30,ENFJ,3,"<no>  I want to sympathize with you enough, and I hope I can comfort you."
2704,46,1,30,ENFJ,4,"<Yes> You have to prepare a lot of cases so that you can prepare for things that don't go as planned, so make a contingency plan."
2705,46,1,30,ENFJ,5,"<Yes>  Always try mind control. Recently, I heard something unpleasant, but I passed it over, saying that it was just that person's feelings and that I shouldn't move them to my own."
2706,46,1,30,ENFJ,6,"<neutrality>  If I know someone, I pretend to know them first, but if it's an event with a lot of people I don't know, I'll introduce myself first or ask questions. that's comfortable"
2707,46,1,30,ENFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I usually work on other projects after completing them, but it's acceptable to do them at the same time, so it depends. Act on importance."
2708,46,1,30,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  He is faithful to his emotions, but he is not overly biased. I think it's because I'm trying to think neutrally."
2709,46,1,30,ENFJ,9,<Yes>  I use the app calendar as a must and take notes of upcoming events. Divide them by color and write them down so that they are easy to see at any time.
2710,46,1,30,ENFJ,10,"<no>  Small mistakes can be made by anyone. In fact, I often miss things, and I think I should have caught it well every time, but I look at myself cutely and move on."
2711,46,1,30,ENFJ,11,"<neutrality>  People who are interested in me rather than people who are not interested in me, so I want to treat them more delicately. I can't pretend to be better."
2712,46,1,30,ENFJ,12,<no>  like works of art and I like to interpret myself or hear others interpret them.
2713,46,1,30,ENFJ,13,"<no>  I'm not on the rational side, so I tend to focus on emotions. I hear a lot of people say that the evaluation of people around them is more emotional than rational."
2714,46,1,30,ENFJ,14,"<no>  I'm a planning person, so I enjoy doing planned things rather than being spontaneous."
2715,46,1,30,ENFJ,15,"<no>  I don't care much about how others see me, but I think I'm living a good life."
2716,46,1,30,ENFJ,16,<Yes>  I think that hanging out with people is always fun and exciting. Getting to know new people is fun.
2717,46,1,30,ENFJ,17,"<Yes>  It's a bit painful, but I think a work that gives many interpretations is a good work. And it's fun to actually interpret."
2718,46,1,30,ENFJ,18,"<neutrality>  My success is also important to me. However, I tend to feel satisfied that I have helped others."
2719,46,1,30,ENFJ,19,"<no>  There are too many interests, but I don't get confused because I put them in order of importance or plan realistically."
2720,46,1,30,ENFJ,20,"<no>  I tend to think positively, so I don't worry. I am confident that I will actually do well, and I believe that good thoughts lead to good results."
2721,46,1,30,ENFJ,21,"<neutrality>  I don't want to avoid it, but these days I don't really want to be a leader. Because it is tiring and boring."
2722,46,1,30,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I draw well, write well, and sing well. can't dance Ever since I was little, I heard a lot of stories about my versatility in arts and sports."
2723,46,1,30,ENFJ,23,<no>  Wouldn't the world be different from robots if there were reason? Emotion is a unique human ability.
2724,46,1,30,ENFJ,24,<Yes>  It's because it's the best feeling to do all the housework and rest. The pleasure you feel in a neatly organized place is indescribable.
2725,46,1,30,ENFJ,25,<no>  I'm tired just hearing what's being argued. It's because most of them are arguing about things that don't have to fight.
2726,46,1,30,ENFJ,26,"<no>  I just don't care if I get attention or not, but I don't deliberately stay still to be buried."
2727,46,1,30,ENFJ,27,"<no>  I know exactly how I feel, but I rarely seem to have changed at random."
2728,46,1,30,ENFJ,28,"<no> Each person has different abilities, so you have to give them what they are good at. It might be a bit frustrating, but that doesn't mean that person is bad."
2729,46,1,30,ENFJ,29,"<neutrality>  I have to write my thesis, but I'm still procrastinating. I tend to postpone or not do things I don't want to do."
2730,46,1,30,ENFJ,30,"<Yes>  This is something I am very curious about and would like to know. If there is an afterlife, I wonder how it is made up. because i want to know everything"
2731,46,1,30,ENFJ,31,"<Yes>  tend to get energy when I'm with people, so it's always fun to be with someone."
2732,46,1,30,ENFJ,32,"<neutrality>  It doesn't matter if it's a topic I like, but I don't like it if it's a boring topic. It was because I couldn't have a conversation with a naive person who only valued theory without experience."
2733,46,1,30,ENFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I don't fully understand, but I think I can relate easily. It is because the heart that wants to be curious and understand is the basis."
2734,46,1,30,ENFJ,34,"<no>  I am good at making decisions and never delay. This is because even if it is a wrong decision, it becomes work only when you make a decision and start."
2735,46,1,30,ENFJ,35,<neutrality>  I tend to regret it and think a lot about whether or not I did well. I think about it a little bit because I want to be perfect.
2736,46,1,30,ENFJ,36,"<neutrality>  just enjoy being alone these days. Maybe it's because I always spend time with my boyfriend, so I think it's good to clean alone and spend a day alone."
2737,46,1,30,ENFJ,37,<Yes>  The moments of quietly appreciating the work and listening to the inner story are very precious.
2738,46,1,30,ENFJ,38,"<no>  I was rather good at empathy, so there were many times when it was difficult. I felt that I wanted to help and to save him."
2739,46,1,30,ENFJ,39,"<Yes>  I don't plan in detail by hour, but I always think about what to do after work, such as housework or exercise."
2740,46,1,30,ENFJ,40,"<no>  I have always had a lot of anxiety. There was an obsession to do well. There were a lot of things I was good at since I was young, but as things got less and less, I constantly tried to maintain an average level."
2741,46,1,30,ENFJ,41,"<no>  Talking on the phone isn't difficult, and we can communicate well. I think the call is rather fast and accurate."
2742,46,1,30,ENFJ,42,"<Yes>  I am very curious about other people's brain structure and mind, and I have a great desire to know psychologically."
2743,46,1,30,ENFJ,43,"<Yes>  It's nice to meet often and it's fun, so I'm the type to ask to meet often. It is because the energy that friends give is quite large."
2744,46,1,30,ENFJ,44,"<Yes>  I try to solve the problem right away when there is a setback because I need to solve it quickly so that the problem does not get bigger. Recently, there was something related to a reservation, but the reservation was canceled and I had to find a new place, but I decided to go to another place right away, discussed it, and made a new reservation."
2745,46,1,30,ENFJ,45,"<neutrality>  There was a time when I regretted it, but I decided to admit it and not have any further self-blame or regrets."
2746,46,1,30,ENFJ,46,"<no>  I read a lot of books about the existence of humans and the reason for living, and I am very interested in them. Since I think philosophy is important in life, I am trying to find the fundamental reason."
2747,46,1,30,ENFJ,47,<no>  am trying very hard to control my emotions and it is not easy. People around her say that she looks calm and comfortable.
2748,46,1,30,ENFJ,48,"<Yes>  I don't think there is any need to be embarrassed. However, I think the other person should know about the right and wrong, so I turn around a little and convey it."
2761,47,1,20,INTJ,1,"<no>  I am satisfied with having the friends I really need, and I think friends with whom I can have deep conversations are more precious than friends I meet lightly."
2762,47,1,20,INTJ,2,"<Yes>  I studied with interest in landscaping, forestry, and history, and recently I am studying trade."
2763,47,1,20,INTJ,3,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the situation. There are times when I want to cry if I can relate to the reason why other people cry, but if I can't understand why someone else cries, I feel antipathy."
2764,47,1,20,INTJ,4,"<neutrality> You always think about the possibility that things might go wrong, but you don't make multiple preparations. Because I don't know for what reason things go wrong, I tend to think of a solution when a situation arises."
2765,47,1,20,INTJ,5,"<Yes>  When it comes to job interviews, I know that being nervous doesn't pay off, so I try to at least act as if I'm not nervous."
2766,47,1,20,INTJ,6,"<Yes> Because it's much easier to talk to people you already know. Also, if you want to reach out to someone new, I think you need a more formal setting and situation than a party or event."
2767,47,1,20,INTJ,7,"<no>  Just because I do various projects doesn't mean that the outcome of the project is bad or that I can't handle it myself, so I just do it."
2768,47,1,20,INTJ,8,"<neutrality>  In everyday life, I think I tend to be sentimental. However, in critical situations, it is sometimes rational, so I chose neutral."
2769,47,1,20,INTJ,9,"<Yes>  I like to make plans. If you have several overlapping tasks, I think organizing them on a calendar or diary is the first order of things."
2770,47,1,20,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  When working with others, if you have a little setback due to your own mistakes, your confidence will drop a lot."
2771,47,1,20,INTJ,11,"<neutrality> Reaching out to people you care about isn't easy. However, when necessary, most of them approached first or created an opportunity to become close."
2772,47,1,20,INTJ,12,<no>  I'm interested. It is interesting that various interpretations based on each person's experience and knowledge can come out of a single work. It's nice to know what I didn't think of.
2773,47,1,20,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  In human relationships, there are times when I follow my emotions, but I usually follow reason rather than emotions. It is also evaluated as rational by those around it."
2774,47,1,20,INTJ,14,"<neutrality>  It depends on the mood and circumstances of the day. Even when I spend time on my interests during my free time, I tend to decide according to the weather or mood of the day."
2775,47,1,20,INTJ,15,"<neutrality>  I think other people's eyes are important, but I think it's more important how you think about yourself. This is because they believe that their own satisfaction is more important than the satisfaction of others."
2776,47,1,20,INTJ,16,"<no>  I enjoy doing things alone more than group activities. These days, even in group activities, I tend to take on tasks that allow me to fulfill a single role alone."
2777,47,1,20,INTJ,17,<neutrality>  It seems that each work is different depending on the content and immersion. There are no recent works of interest.
2778,47,1,20,INTJ,18,"<no> Helping others succeed gives me satisfaction, but I believe that my own success is primarily important. Because the success of others ultimately belongs to others."
2779,47,1,20,INTJ,19,"<Yes>  Having a lot of interests means you have a lot of options, so you worry. Recently, I had a lot of difficulties when choosing a minor."
2780,47,1,20,INTJ,20,"<neutrality>  If you make a mistake and you can recover from it, then you don't worry too much. Worrying can increase the accuracy of work, but I don't think it's a solution."
2781,47,1,20,INTJ,21,<Yes>  I think it's more fun to perfectly solve your role than to play the role of a leader.
2782,47,1,20,INTJ,22,"<Yes>  It's because I've been interested in music and art, but I've never thought of wanting to study that field like other fields."
2783,47,1,20,INTJ,23,"<neutrality> Even if you put importance on reason, in the end there will be victims. A better world believes that emotion and reason are appropriately needed depending on the situation."
2784,47,1,20,INTJ,24,<Yes>  It's because there is no uncomfortable mind to finish what to do first and then take a break.
2785,47,1,20,INTJ,25,<Yes>  It is because we believe that new facts and reasonable plans can be obtained through the stories and evidence of different people.
2786,47,1,20,INTJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't go in front of people unless absolutely necessary, and I try to agree with the majority."
2787,47,1,20,INTJ,27,"<Yes>  For example, if a project is going smoothly, but if there is a slight blockage, it will quickly get stuck and you will think about the direction of the project itself."
2788,47,1,20,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  I think it is the biggest cause of quarrels with family members. If you don't do the obvious efficient process, you feel frustrated."
2789,47,1,20,INTJ,29,"<Yes>  We often put off things that we have to do if they are not of great concern. Even recently, I'm only handling work in the field that I'm interested in."
2790,47,1,20,INTJ,30,"<Yes>  In the end, it's a personal imagination, so I think you can hear stories from various directions."
2791,47,1,20,INTJ,31,"<no>  I want to spend my leisure life with a lot of people, but I prefer to be alone most of the time. Even these days, I prefer to spend time alone."
2792,47,1,20,INTJ,32,"<no>  think the underlying story is also important. When discussing, it was easy to move on to the next in-depth discussion only when the original story was finished."
2793,47,1,20,INTJ,33,"<neutrality>  Full empathy is impossible, but imperfect empathy is possible. Ultimately, people feel the same way."
2794,47,1,20,INTJ,34,<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the job. But most of the time I'm trying to decide halfway.
2795,47,1,20,INTJ,35,<no> We try to rethink decisions we've already made because we don't always make the right decisions.
2796,47,1,20,INTJ,36,<no>  You prefer to spend time alone and enjoy your interests or leisure activities.
2797,47,1,20,INTJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't enjoy looking at art, but I do enjoy going to art galleries."

2799,47,1,20,INTJ,39,"<no>  I think it's important to have a big frame, but I don't like to plan out my daily tasks. In particular, I do not prefer it even more because I do not know what variables will arise in work or private affairs."
2800,47,1,20,INTJ,40,"<no> Because they are very sensitive to their own mistakes, they often feel insecure by default. It seems to be an innate tendency."
2801,47,1,20,INTJ,41,"<no>  Rather than communicating via text, I prefer to communicate over the phone because emotions and intentions are conveyed better."
2802,47,1,20,INTJ,42,"<no>  Respect other people's opinions, but don't try to understand them. Even when there is a conflict in a relationship, we do not try to understand it unless it is absolutely necessary."
2803,47,1,20,INTJ,43,"<no>  When my friends make an appointment, I tend to go out. However, when I have a lot of time alone, I sometimes call to meet up first."
2804,47,1,20,INTJ,44,"<no>  I tend to redefine the plan itself. I had a test preparation plan, but when something went wrong, I got rid of the old plan and made a new one."
2805,47,1,20,INTJ,45,<Yes>  There are times when you blame yourself for making a mistake in a relationship with a friend and why you acted the way you did even after a long time has passed.
2806,47,1,20,INTJ,46,"<neutrality>  I don't think deeply, but I think it is necessary to think to some extent. It's because I think philosophical consideration can be the driving force of life."
2807,47,1,20,INTJ,47,<Yes>  Emotions seem to be valued unless reason is absolutely necessary. He says he tends to be swayed around him.
2808,47,1,20,INTJ,48,"<Yes>  If it's not a big mistake, I try to save face so as not to make a big problem with the other person."
2821,48,1,30,ISTP,1,<no>  I don't bother making new friends. Or I'm comfortable talking to people I know online. The reason is that I like being alone.
2822,48,1,30,ISTP,2,"<neutrality>  I spend time exploring my interests, but not diverse. These days, I'm watching music videos from the 90's. The reason is that many of the singers I liked came out and reminded me of memories from the past."
2823,48,1,30,ISTP,3,<Yes>  I cry a lot when I see other people crying on TV. The reason is that I seem to relate to that feeling too. I hope that person will be happy in the future without anything sad.
2824,48,1,30,ISTP,4,"<neutrality>  I think a lot to set up a contingency plan and try to write down a contingency plan in a notebook. However, there are times when I don¡¯t have to come up with a countermeasure right away."
2825,48,1,30,ISTP,5,"<no>  I am not good at maintaining my composure in a high-pressure environment. The reason is that when someone I know or don't know points out, my heart beats and I get tired. You want to get out of this situation quickly."
2826,48,1,30,ISTP,6,<neutrality>  I don't talk a lot at parties or events. The reason is that people who know or don't know are very uncomfortable at the scene. It's just there as it goes.
2827,48,1,30,ISTP,7,"<no>  Most of the time I don't finish one project and start another. The reason is that if you get bored quickly or if you think you need to take care of other things first, you do it first."
2828,48,1,30,ISTP,8,"<neutrality>  easily fall into daydreams or delusions after watching a movie, and sometimes I imagine that something absurd can happen, but later I come to my senses, wondering why I am thinking nonsense."
2829,48,1,30,ISTP,9,"<no>  I buy a notebook to make a plan, but I don't like writing down a plan, so I don't do it and do a lot of improvisation."
2830,48,1,30,ISTP,10,<Yes>  doubt my ability or knowledge a lot when I point out mistakes. There are many times when you can't believe me. There are many times when I can't get out of the pain of thinking again if I make a mistake with the knowledge I know very well.
2831,48,1,30,ISTP,11,"<no>  It's very difficult for me to reach people. I don't usually try to talk to people I don't know, and I walk away when I feel like I have something to talk about."
2832,48,1,30,ISTP,12,"<neutrality>  have enjoyed watching the commentary and discussion on art works on TV. It's fun to learn new facts. However, I don't know much about art works, so it varies depending on the work."
2833,48,1,30,ISTP,13,"<neutrality>  When I get angry, I have to release my anger first. There are times when I think rationally and think about what will happen later, but it is very difficult in pain later."
2834,48,1,30,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  don't like making plans. Even if you travel normally, there are many cases where you decide where to go on the day, and there are many times when you worry about which bus to take or where to go to play."
2835,48,1,30,ISTP,15,"<Yes>  I care a lot about how others see me. I think I care more because I don't think I'm good at anything. I do think that if I get better, I'll pay less attention."
2836,48,1,30,ISTP,16,<no>  don't like meeting people. It's very uncomfortable. I think I'll look more shabby if I do group activities. I don't meet anyone at all these days.
2837,48,1,30,ISTP,17,"<neutrality>  I like the way other people think and interpret it, and I like that the answer is immediately clear. Lately, I think I've been thinking about Hotel del Luna or the strange lawyer Woo Young-woo."
2838,48,1,30,ISTP,18,"<neutrality> When I help others, the sense of accomplishment often gives me strength to live, but I don't do it with all my passion. There are many times when I don't help if I'm lacking."
2839,48,1,30,ISTP,19,<no>  I don't have much interest. The reason is because I think I'm worse than others and I'm not good at concentrating. So there's not much I want to do.
2840,48,1,30,ISTP,20,"<Yes> In my social life, I was often scolded. That's why I'm always nervous and often worry a lot. So I'm afraid to try something."
2841,48,1,30,ISTP,21,"<Yes>  I used to want to be a lot, but now I want to avoid it. The reason is that I know that I am lacking and I am afraid of making mistakes, so I don't want to stand out."
2842,48,1,30,ISTP,22,<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that I don't have much experience getting good grades when doing art.
2843,48,1,30,ISTP,23,"<neutrality>  I'm not sure. I think that being angry but not being able to control it inside makes me sick. However, I think it is safer and everyone is happy when there is rational judgment."
2844,48,1,30,ISTP,24,"<neutrality>  I usually take a break without finishing the housework first. I don't mind doing the housework, but sometimes I do it first when it's too messy."
2845,48,1,30,ISTP,25,"<neutrality>  I try to understand and listen to both sides in discussions or situations where I am not applicable, but I often hate it when I try to fight and try to avoid it."
2846,48,1,30,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  I try not to draw attention. The reason is that there are more mistakes than good times, so we tend to avoid them in the first place."
2847,48,1,30,ISTP,27,"<neutrality> Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, but there are many times when I'm in a bad mood because the bad mood lasts for a long time."
2848,48,1,30,ISTP,28,"<neutrality>  I try to understand because I can't do it myself, but there are many cases where I can't understand, so there are times when I get annoyed."
2849,48,1,30,ISTP,29,"<Yes>  I often procrastinate on things I have to do. Recently, there have been times when I've been in trouble because I didn't clean the house and put off the laundry."
2850,48,1,30,ISTP,30,"<Yes>  think it's interesting because it's not something that's happening to me right now, and it's something I don't know on a daily basis."
2851,48,1,30,ISTP,31,"<neutrality>  I'm very uncomfortable when I'm with other people, but sometimes I have fun talking to people."
2852,48,1,30,ISTP,32,"<neutrality>  There are many things I don't understand, so there are times when I'm not interested in theory-centered discussions, but I sometimes watch TV discussions because I'm interested in discussions in interesting fields."
2853,48,1,30,ISTP,33,"<neutrality>  I try very hard to empathize. The reason is that I also have a lot of things that others do not understand, so I try to change my position and think about it."
2854,48,1,30,ISTP,34,"<neutrality>  If it's easy to make a decision, I'll make it right away, but it's not like that."
2855,48,1,30,ISTP,35,<no>  think a lot about the decisions I've already made. it's tough. There are many things I buy and sell stocks and think about what I wish I hadn't done in the past.
2856,48,1,30,ISTP,36,"<no>  I enjoy my alone time. I have no one to meet and there are times when being together is uncomfortable, so I am mostly at home."
2857,48,1,30,ISTP,37,"<neutrality>  I don't go to art museums often, but I like to go and think about this painting. If you are nearby, you can go there too."
2858,48,1,30,ISTP,38,"<neutrality>  I'm not bisexual or gay, but I don't quite understand it, but I'm trying to put myself in someone else's shoes. The reason is because I also want to be understood."
2859,48,1,30,ISTP,39,"<neutrality>  I don't like planning. However, in a situation where you don't know what to do, you can plan step by step."
2860,48,1,30,ISTP,40,"<no>  always feel insecure. I'm not doing well right now, so I keep thinking in my head if I can always get out of this situation."
2861,48,1,30,ISTP,41,"<Yes>  My heart often races when someone I know is inconvenient. Usually, just hearing a vibration or ringtone makes my heart race and I am afraid. The reason is because you don't know what to say."
2862,48,1,30,ISTP,42,"<neutrality>  read articles and articles to try to understand, but there are many times when I don't understand, and I don't bother to spend a lot of time trying to understand."
2863,48,1,30,ISTP,43,"<neutrality>  Sometimes, when I want to talk, I call to meet first. But I don't contact them to meet often."
2864,48,1,30,ISTP,44,"<neutrality>  When there is a setback in my plans, I usually don't know what to do and I put it off because I don't want to do it well, but if it's a situation that needs to be done quickly, I try to solve it."
2865,48,1,30,ISTP,45,"<Yes>  I regret my mistake very much. I don't think I'll regret it if everything goes well, but I regret it because everything went wrong. These days, I regret a lot with stocks and coins."
2866,48,1,30,ISTP,46,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I have thought deeply about existence and the reason for living, and there have been times when I have searched for it. The reason is because I don't know why I have to live now."
2867,48,1,30,ISTP,47,<Yes>  am very driven by my emotions. Others think so too. I also have trouble controlling my emotions and often get easily agitated by what others say.
2868,48,1,30,ISTP,48,"<Yes>  I've made a lot of mistakes and suffered a lot from them, so I know how others feel because of my mistakes, so I try to save face."
2881,49,0,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  don't like meeting people. The reason is that my tendency is to match the person's preferences or choices when meeting others, so I consume a lot of energy."
2882,49,0,40,INFJ,2,"<neutrality>  I tend to spend my free time at home. It's because they don't like to walk around. Usually, while surfing the web or reading, I come across a variety of interests, but I tend to focus on my favorite fields without digging deeply. These days, I'm obsessed with webtoons."
2883,49,0,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes>  As I got older, there were definitely more tears. Perhaps because of that reason, there are many times when my heart feels heavy when I see someone's tears. I definitely feel that my sensitivity has become richer than when I was in my 20s. In particular, while watching movies or dramas, there are many times when other people cry even in scenes where nothing is wrong."
2884,49,0,40,INFJ,4,"<neutrality>  My inclination is often to stay in a skeptical gaze. For that reason, I tend to assume and act when it doesn¡¯t go well rather than when it goes well. However, the stress caused by it is not easy, so I tend to prepare for it up to a certain point and let go of more than that."
2885,49,0,40,INFJ,5,"<neutrality> My inclination is not to enjoy pressure. For that reason, when the pressure is severe, it usually accompanies stress and shrinks. However, it also has the characteristic of ignoring the pressure when the pressure exceeds the standard. So, on the contrary, there are strong parts in practice."
2886,49,0,40,INFJ,6,"<no> Parties and events belong to inevitable encounters. In that case, I tend to talk or build relationships with new people rather than people I know. The reason is usually that people I know tend to be passive, so it often creates an awkward atmosphere when I'm with them at such an event. I hate the stress of that awkwardness. So, in order to avoid that discomfort, an outgoing appearance is sometimes expressed, unlike my tendency."
2887,49,0,40,INFJ,7,"<Yes>  don't overestimate my abilities. The reason is because I'm on the side of feeling the limits of my ability. Therefore, when starting a certain task, rather than expanding the task, act in the direction of removing the variable of the task. With this attitude, I tend to finish one project and start another."
2888,49,0,40,INFJ,8,"<neutrality> When I am alone, I am sentimental. The reason for this is, as mentioned above, that as we get older, we become more sensitive and understand others through our emotions. However, when I am working or encountering a situation, I tend to lean towards reason rather than emotion, and my actions tend to go in that direction as well. This is because there are fewer regrets and the worst can be avoided."
2889,49,0,40,INFJ,9,"<no>  Of course, you have to make a plan when you are working on something. However, even in my daily life, I do not plan enough to make a schedule using a diary or calendar and schematize it as a list."
2890,49,0,40,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  I'm on the negative side. For that reason, I constantly doubt my ability or results. As a result, I can expect the role of a growth point where I can constantly be vigilant and grow without being complacent in my position. However, the downside is that the consistency of the ability is reduced due to the vigilance to the unconscious familiarity of the work, and there is a part that takes more time to process the work."
2891,49,0,40,INFJ,11,"<Yes>  Of course, I don't enjoy meeting and talking to people. However, in an unavoidable situation, if there is someone I'm interested in, I share an unfamiliar situation with him, so when I talk to him first, he usually responds to my conversation to avoid an uncomfortable situation. Also, because I lead the conversation and have a conversation in a pattern that induces him to respond, he also has a conversation without much discomfort."
2892,49,0,40,INFJ,12,"<no>  I am an aspiring writer. For that reason, I tend to deeply examine the intentions and scenes of the writers of works such as movies and novels, and when I meet people with the same interests, I tend to discuss the topic a lot."
2893,49,0,40,INFJ,13,"<Yes> This seems to be independent of sensitivity. Sensitivity is abundant, but when faced with a choice or situation, the weight of judgment often turns to reason. As I mentioned earlier, I choose to minimize variables and have fewer regrets, so this judgment is rational when it is based on reason rather than emotion. Perhaps because of this, there are many times when people around me evaluate me as being unexpected or disliked."
2894,49,0,40,INFJ,14,"<no> As mentioned earlier, I do not live a life of planning in my daily life, recording in a diary, or schematizing with a calendar. However, to some extent, I draw a routine or schedule in my head and live it. Also, rather than being impulsive, if I have a schedule that I need, I simulate it the day before and think a lot to fit it into my daily life."
2895,49,0,40,INFJ,15,"<neutrality> Of course, the eyes of others are conscious. For that reason, there are many times when I am restricted in what I want to do, how I dress, or what I choose, and there are times when I am forced to do things I don't want to do. However, there are times when it is not possible to compromise. In that case, I respect my choice rather than the gaze of others. The stress caused by that is great, but there are also a large part of us that accept and accept that it is unavoidable."
2896,49,0,40,INFJ,16,"<no> Basically, I don't like hanging out with other people. The reason is that I tend to resolve the differences or discomforts that arise from hanging out with others by adapting to them. That's why when you spend time with others, you consume a lot of energy and get tired easily. It really doesn't seem that different these days."
2897,49,0,40,INFJ,17,"<no> Of course, as an aspiring writer, books and movies with multiple meanings become subjects to study and become a good source of inspiration. However, as a reader, I prefer an ending that is cool and leads to a single context that the book or movie has led. Maybe that's why I like munchkin watery webtoons like level up these days."
2898,49,0,40,INFJ,18,"<Yes>  think I'm more of a peripheral character than a main character. The reason is because when I look at myself, it's hard to like myself even if I think about it. So I think my success is unbelievable and incomplete. However, I have found that relationships with others can lead me to perfection myself, and if I am on the path to success, I will feel great satisfaction if I achieve it by the side of someone who is confident and whom I cannot help but admire. I can get it, and I think that's the way my existence can be perfected."
2899,49,0,40,INFJ,19,"<Yes>  I will take the above question as a propensity for my indecisiveness. I am indecisive. For example, even though I put all the things I planned at the mart in the shopping cart, I couldn't choose a snack, so I wandered around for more than 30 minutes. Rather, I found that the wider the choice, the more stressed I tend to be."
2900,49,0,40,INFJ,20,"<Yes>  tend to have a lot of negative tendencies. That is, they are more pessimistic than optimistic. The reason seems to be related to the background of growth. Since childhood, it was a time when I was criticized or scolded for things I hadn't achieved rather than praised, and it was natural for me to worry about an imperfect and unstable future rather than believing in myself. I think that my inclination formed as a result is still affecting me."
2901,49,0,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes> There was a trigger. Determining the role of a leader means that the organization or team is in its infancy, and in most cases, it can be assumed that it is an unfamiliar situation for each team member. In such situations, people do not want to assume the role of a leader who assumes responsibility. In most cases, I took on the role of leader with the feeling that I was carrying the arms to prevent wasting time. However, as time went on, I experienced that the idea of volunteering did not benefit the team. I realized that there are times when the team works even without me and even gets better. It was a memory that made me feel ashamed that I was only far away."
2902,49,0,40,INFJ,22,"<neutrality>  If I thought I had no artistic inclinations, I certainly wouldn't have started my career as an aspiring writer. Of course, that doesn't mean I don't think I'm full of talent. I am still working hard with about 50% aptitude and about 50% interest. Of course, I think that the experience of being recognized for the short story I wrote or the experience of getting on the air with my writing was important."
2903,49,0,40,INFJ,23,"<no> It's hard to agree with your question. Personally, I think the world has been dominated by reason. As is often thought, emotion and reason are polar opposites. But that is why reason cannot replace emotion and vice versa. The biggest reason is that reason is permanent, but emotions are temporary. And the time of the world is long, and time is called history because it is intertwined with human life. In other words, because it is reason with a lasting attribute, it could become the logic that dominates the world, and temporary emotions are only buried in history and cannot become a flow that encompasses history. However, in exceptional cases, there are cases where emotions have a lasting property rather than a temporary property. Like a rare encounter with a water-attribute cat. We call it passion or madness. Although this emotion does not become a flow that encompasses history, there are times when it functions as an inflection point that changes the flow of history. Just like the passion and madness of those who led art, science, invention, and discovery. Therefore, reason and emotions have different functions, and I think that their functions have been intertwined with each other to lead civilization and the world."
2904,49,0,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  I want to ask a question. Can you really relax comfortably in a state of distraction and dizziness in the house? My answer is definitely NO. Rest is to clear your mind. In order to do that, of course, the outside must be cleaned, so wouldn't that energy be replicated?"
2905,49,0,40,INFJ,25,"<no> Of course, disagreements with others are unavoidable. For that reason, controversy is inevitable. However, even if it is inevitable, it is difficult to enjoy the spectacle of fighting over the territory of opinions. The clearer the position, the harder it is to persuade, and the fiercer the debate. In that case, it usually translates into unproductive emotional consumption rather than persuasion. Personally, I wish I had negotiated and traded with the other party before getting into an argument. It is practically impossible to 100% return the other party's position. In that case, I think we can narrow the difference of opinion before reaching an argument if we divide the approach into persuasive and unpersuasive parts, and also make a deal by choosing what is acceptable and what is not."
2906,49,0,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  Personally, my religious inclination is close to Buddhism. For that reason, as the saying goes, fate is replaced by karma even if you just brush your collar. In the end, the more you attract others' attention, the more relationships are formed and ties are formed. It is my theory that karma will accumulate and this will become an obstacle to liberation. Of course, I think that the person's tendency not to enjoy human relationships has a certain share."
2907,49,0,40,INFJ,27,"<no>  mentioned earlier that my disposition is negative and pessimistic. For that reason, there is no such thing as being naturally timid and having a depressed life in childhood, but in a way, the biggest reason is that negative and pessimistic tendencies assumed from the bottom are helpful in reducing emotional ups and downs. . Emotional ups and downs are like a scary roller coaster. However, in the state where it has already come down to the floor, the roller coaster is no longer a scary subject. Personally, I don't like people with high emotional ups and downs. It is because the drop as much as the ups and downs cause great anxiety in me dealing with that person."
2908,49,0,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes> To paraphrase the question, I think it's correct to answer that I get annoyed when I see someone who looks like me. The reason is that I myself am a person who wants to be efficient but is not efficient. To be effective, you need to keep variables under control and be self-assured. However, I am a person with many variables that I cannot do anything about, and I am also a person who often doubts myself when I am swayed by them. That's why I'm wrapped up in self-hatred, but when I see someone else who can project me with such a gaze, I get annoyed without even realizing that I'm a stranger. It's like meeting someone wearing the same outfit on the street."
2909,49,0,40,INFJ,29,"<Yes> It is also an ironic answer that contradicts the answer to the question of resting after doing housework above. The reason is inertia. I am a person with a very strong inertia to stay in a certain state. Because of that inertia, I have a strong habit of wanting to stay in a state that satisfies my standards, so I do all the housework and stay in a neat state, and because of that inertia, I put off as much as possible other things that need to be changed from the current state that I am satisfied with. Of course, I don't think it's a good habit, but it's also a part that is done unconsciously if you're not conscious."
2910,49,0,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes> Just like when talking about aliens, space, or the deep sea, mysteries are always interesting. Curiosity that we don't know is like an itch creeping up our back, which makes us sore and unable to stay still."
2911,49,0,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  Spending time with others is tiring. The reason for this is, as mentioned above, due to the person's tendency to adapt to others. Because it consumes so much energy, I don't prefer spending time with others, and nothing has changed these days."
2912,49,0,40,INFJ,32,"<Yes> The original story is a story that encompasses everything, has no risk, and nothing new to gain. I don't enjoy debate, but I often find myself enlightened when I share different views with others. However, the principled story is close to the premise of life that there is no story to share and there is no need to do so. For example, what can be rebutted to the principled argument that people shouldn't kill people? But when it comes to the question of whether the kidnapper who kidnapped my daughter should be killed, there will be a lot of talk. Even a movie was made on this topic."
2913,49,0,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes> When I empathize with others, I tend to use my imagination along with my emotions. I picture the situation someone is in in detail and face the irony of the choice he or she has to make. For example, in the case of the suicide of a successful businessman, think like this. His wallet contains checks of the money I need to earn in a year to have. And on his desk is the newest laptop and curve monitor I've been longing for, and in the kitchen, his beautiful wife is humming a song while cooking. His life has everything I could hope for, and there's no reason he's not happy. The problem is that his life has become natural for me, just like living in a gosiwon. He longed for a boring and unpredictable life. However, for him, the number of cases was just leisure, and soon his longing for life reached even to death. It's like trying to sympathize with his choice from a different background in this way."
2914,49,0,40,INFJ,34,"<Yes>  This equates to the question of procrastinating and the question of concern mentioned above. If the decision causes a change in my present state, I will naturally put it off because of inertia. Also, if the opportunity cost is scattered in the choice, the choice will drift with indecisiveness while calculating the opportunity cost."
2915,49,0,40,INFJ,35,"<Yes>  Of course I regret it. He tends to have a lot of lingering regrets and sometimes looks back on his work with doubts about himself. If you look up to this point, you may think of the past, but once you look back and decide that there is no turning back, you will not look back after that. It's because I realize that it's useless to regret it because it's out of my hands anyway."
2916,49,0,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  As mentioned earlier, relationships with people are like a drain on energy and an increase in fatigue. That is why time alone is essential to relieve fatigue, and this has not changed even these days."
2917,49,0,40,INFJ,37,"<neutrality> As a homebody, I rarely visit art galleries, but when I do, I tend to have a good time. Of course, the work of appreciating a painting and visualizing the image is also a source of inspiration for me."
2918,49,0,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  think the opposite. On the contrary, there are many times when I read other people's emotions too sensitively, so there are many times when it's hard. Of course, there are times when he says no, but on the contrary, when I consider others with the context of my thoughts, his actions, and the emotions I read from his expression, I see that he often reacts as if he knew how he knew, so my intuition is not so wrong. It seems like... As if it's hard to make a choice because I'm given too much information, there are many times when it's hard for me to react to the emotions of others because they're given to me that way."
2919,49,0,40,INFJ,39,"<no>  don't plan However, there is a routine that makes up my life, and I tend to put the necessary schedule in the routine after running enough simulations to think about it. In addition, in the case of work or personal affairs, there is a direction to proceed with the schedule in a big frame rather than detailed planning. As mentioned earlier, it is the extent to which work boundaries are divided in order to minimize variables and efficiently use limited time."
2920,49,0,40,INFJ,40,"<no>  On the contrary, I live with anxiety every day. As I said before, there is a natural tendency to be timid, and there is also the influence of unstable childhood. It is also true that my pessimistic and negative tendencies have developed like a typhoon due to that anxiety."
2921,49,0,40,INFJ,41,"<Yes>  Looking into the other person's eyes, reading their facial expressions, and conversing has a very low probability of failure in conversation as much information is preoccupied. However, in the case of a call, the route of all this information is blocked and must be judged by his voice. That's why the phone call is cut off and awkward, and it's easy to feel uncomfortable after the call is over. I think it's probably the weakness of my human relationship that fits the other person."
2922,49,0,40,INFJ,42,"<Yes>  To be precise, it can be said that I am ignorant or difficult to understand opinions that are different from mine. Because my ignorance shouldn't be my position. However, even if it is a different opinion from mine, I do not spend time in cases where I can understand the opinion."
2923,49,0,40,INFJ,43,"<no>  don't really like talking on the phone, and I personally don't like the idea of intruding into a friend's life. Of course, it is also to blame for my tendency to look tired at human relationships. However, I personally have a theory that in order to make an appointment, you have to contact me a week in advance. The reason is, as I said before, to not disturb your friend's private life. However, most of the contact is a day or two ago, and this is the part that I consider rude. But I can't force my thoughts on my friends. I think that is the reason why I am not active in making promises with my friends."
2924,49,0,40,INFJ,44,"<no> There is an image that comes to mind whenever there is a setback in the plan. It is a video of Mr. Tong squeezing himself into a small crystal box. In other words, along with the question that I might have squeezed in a reality that could not be included in the plan. Variables that arise at first are reported incidentally and proceed as planned. However, if the setbacks are repeated, it will be regarded as a failure of the plan and proceed according to the situation at the site. For example, there was a clear schedule at the play meeting with the lower grade children, which was held part-time part-time, but due to the lack of time and the limit of children's control, I remember that the play was carried out according to the situation at the time rather than planned."
2925,49,0,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes> This kind of action is called a blanket kick, but there are many such cases. Of course, I think it contradicts the answer to the question of whether you rethink the conclusions you have already reached, but I want to say this. I give up, but I also regret it. Just as water droplets form on each drop of water when a cold drink is poured into a cup, I think that even if you coolly put your regrets to rest with reason, you can't help but feel the emotions that form on you. Regrets these days are stocks. Since I have gone down too much, I regret that I have to endure a little and do what I have to do lately."
2926,49,0,40,INFJ,46,"<no> The question of human nature is always valid. However, the more I repeat it, the more I feel like I'm falling into the abyss and there's no answer, so I feel like I want to turn away. However, since it is an unavoidable question that you will have to face someday, I don't think it's enough to take the time to think about it every time. The most important reason for this question is death. This question is established because human beings die. This question, which contains the finiteness of life and the defect of the body, is like a needle pointed at a balloon full of air. That's why there really is no answer. Because there is no way not to die. Therefore, we must admit that death is a part of life And the value that has sustained our lives is worthless in front of this question. Without breaking it down, this question has no choice but to be omitted at this moment."
2927,49,0,40,INFJ,47,"<neutrality> When I was in my 30s, I knew how to control my emotions. No matter what emotions arise, I look at myself objectively and keep a distance from myself so that I am not swept away by emotions. However, there are many times when I am swept away by emotions these days when I am in my 40s. I know how, but it didn't work out well. It is said that the older you get, the more aloof you become, but the older you get, the more impatient you become with a life without achievements. However, there is nothing that causes trouble to those around me because of my emotions. Perhaps that is the last line of emotional regulation."
2928,49,0,40,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  To be precise, if the other person does something wrong to me, I don't protest or argue. Of course, you may feel unfair or annoyed, but the problem is that if you quarrel and things get bigger, it's difficult to deal with and annoying. Of course, if these things happen frequently, we would of course mention them, but if they don't, we tend to ignore them and pass by."
2941,50,0,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  Doesn't make new friends. The reason is that making new friends feels cumbersome and annoying, and it is comfortable to stay with existing friends."
2942,50,0,40,INFJ,2,<Yes>  I tend to explore any field mainly through books or the Internet. These days I am interested in camping.
2943,50,0,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes> In general, it seems to be sad together in such cases. I think about the situation of the other person who is crying, what if it were me."
2944,50,0,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to plan countermeasures in advance in case everything goes wrong. Otherwise, you will not be able to work properly without worrying and worrying."
2945,50,0,40,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  I usually keep my composure. Recently, I lost my job and my economic situation is not good, but I am calmly preparing for a more distant future."
2946,50,0,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  Rather than talking to someone new, I usually talk to people I know. Reaching out to someone new can be difficult."
2947,50,0,40,INFJ,7,"<Yes>  It's hard to focus if you don't finish one project and work on another. In the past, two contracts were executed simultaneously and both failed to meet their deadlines."
2948,50,0,40,INFJ,8,"<neutrality>  It's mostly sentimental, but not too bad. I usually indulge in sentimental thoughts and then try to think rationally."
2949,50,0,40,INFJ,9,"<neutrality>  Having a good plan is comfortable, but it tends to be annoying. Instead of using a diary, you manage simple memos or important schedules with your mobile phone."
2950,50,0,40,INFJ,10,"<neutrality> Although they react sensitively to mistakes, they put more effort into finding and correcting the cause. I haven't had that experience lately."
2951,50,0,40,INFJ,11,"<no>  Interested, but not the first to talk. I am embarrassed to talk to you first and I am afraid that the other person will feel burdened or hate me. In my previous work, I met many people at dinner parties from different countries, but I didn't speak to them first."
2952,50,0,40,INFJ,12,"<neutrality>  Interpretation of works of art is for reference only. I don't like to discuss with others. It is difficult to interpret, but I think it is right that art works should be appreciated and interpreted differently depending on the individual."
2953,50,0,40,INFJ,13,"<neutrality>  try to judge myself more rationally, but the emotional part seems to work a lot too. I think I am rational, but my acquaintances say that I have a lot of emotional parts."
2954,50,0,40,INFJ,14,"<no>  Usually in the morning, if there is something I must do today, I plan my schedule in advance and try to move. I put off what I had to do today and went on an impromptu day trip, so I couldn't rest well because of my worries."
2955,50,0,40,INFJ,15,"<Yes>  care what others think of me. There was no special occasion, but I tend to be conscious of other people's eyes."
2956,50,0,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  I prefer to do things alone rather than group activities. Recently, as I spend more time alone, I do not do group activities at all."
2957,50,0,40,INFJ,17,<no>  I don't like it when the ending can be interpreted in various ways because it leaves something uncomfortable. Something needs to have a clear ending to feel clean and complete.
2958,50,0,40,INFJ,18,"<no>  I've lived like that until now, but I feel only disappointment and loss rather than satisfaction. The company I worked for a long time has grown greatly, and some have been very successful, but I only have scars."
2959,50,0,40,INFJ,19,<no>  I tend not to be interested in many things at the same time. I tend to prioritize and work on the most important things first.
2960,50,0,40,INFJ,20,"<Yes>  I am often anxious that things might go wrong. There was no special occasion, but it seems that there have been many cases in which the things I have worried about became reality in my life."
2961,50,0,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid it if possible. I have tried to lead a group as a leader, but it is difficult to coordinate the thoughts and opinions of many people, and it seems that individual efforts and sacrifices are required."
2962,50,0,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  I like to enjoy various fields of art. I like to play musical instruments and am interested in music, painting and calligraphy."
2963,50,0,40,INFJ,23,"<neutrality>  Reason may have worked a lot in the development of science and technology, but if there is no emotional consideration for people who are tired of the complex modern society, I think technological development would be meaningless."
2964,50,0,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes> When I have leftover housework, I can't rest because I'm anxious. It seems that you can rest properly with a sense of satisfaction if you clean something neatly and rest."
2965,50,0,40,INFJ,25,"<no>  It's uncomfortable and I don't want to get involved in other people's arguments. We may have different opinions, but I think we can avoid disputes if we make some concessions and understand each other."
2966,50,0,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  It's uncomfortable when people's eyes are on you, and if possible, I want to stay quiet. Personally, I am an introvert and I hate attracting attention from others."
2967,50,0,40,INFJ,27,"<no>  You fall for one emotion quickly, but don't change easily to another. Listening to a sad movie or music will take some time to sort out your sad feelings and restore your composure."
2968,50,0,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes>  Because I have a quick-tempered personality, I feel cramped when things progress slowly. Working with someone who is slow at work is so frustrating that it is often more comfortable to handle the other person's work alone."
2969,50,0,40,INFJ,29,"<no>  If possible, try not to procrastinate. I can't rest properly because I'm always anxious if I don't finish what I have to do."
2970,50,0,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes>  I often wonder what the unknown afterlife will be like. I like horror genre movies and stories, but I hate the religious part."
2971,50,0,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  like to be alone. In particular, these days, I spend a lot of time alone and I rarely meet other people."
2972,50,0,40,INFJ,32,"<neutrality>  The theoretical discussions are boring, but I think they are necessary. The technology-related seminars led by government-affiliated organizations, which I attended a lot for work, were boring, but they seemed to be the most effective way to determine future policy directions or develop technology."
2973,50,0,40,INFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I tend to easily sympathize with people who are in a worse environment than myself, but I do not easily sympathize with the opposite case. The attitudes and thoughts of people born with the so-called golden spoon are often rejected."
2974,50,0,40,INFJ,34,"<no>  Rather than procrastinating, I tend to make decisions ahead of time if possible and push things along the way."
2975,50,0,40,INFJ,35,"<no>  regret it later and blame myself. There have been a lot of recent cases where things went wrong due to hasty decisions, so there are many times when you regret it."
2976,50,0,40,INFJ,36,<no>  I mostly enjoy spending time alone. Especially since I don't have much time to meet people these days.
2977,50,0,40,INFJ,37,"<neutrality>  Museums tend to be a bit boring, but I like music concerts and related events. I also like visiting museums with many historical artifacts and works of art."
2978,50,0,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  I am good at understanding other people's feelings. And in most cases, I try to empathize with them. For those who are tired and sad because of difficult things, the first thing they want to do is to grieve with them and comfort them."
2979,50,0,40,INFJ,39,<Yes>  It's easy to plan and move everything. Work seems to be able to cope with exceptional situations well by moving more plannedly.
2980,50,0,40,INFJ,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure and worry a lot. Although there is no special reason, he is a naturally worried personality."
2981,50,0,40,INFJ,41,<Yes>  You want to avoid talking on the phone unless absolutely necessary. I hate the often lengthy phone calls and prefer to talk face-to-face if absolutely necessary.
2982,50,0,40,INFJ,42,"<neutrality> It is embarrassing to hear such opinions, but if the reason is not easily accepted, I just ignore it or try not to think deeply."
2983,50,0,40,INFJ,43,"<no>  We usually meet when we get in touch. If you need to contact them first, they do it first, but not many."
2984,50,0,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes> We will try to get things moving back to plan as quickly as possible. It could have been difficult because I didn't have enough time to study because the recent acquisition of the license I was preparing for suddenly happened, but I was able to acquire the license safely by reducing other work and proceeding as planned."
2985,50,0,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes>  It seems that the situation is not good right now, so it is even more so. I often regret my past decision as the originally planned change of job has become difficult."
2986,50,0,40,INFJ,46,<no>  always keep those issues in mind and think about where to put my values. I think I can decide what to do hard now only when those values stand right.
2987,50,0,40,INFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I think I judge and act rationally. However, there are times when people around you say that you respond emotionally."
2988,50,0,40,INFJ,48,"<neutrality> It seems to depend on the degree of fault. Most of them understand and try to save face, but in the case of a big mistake that cannot be recovered, they clearly point out what went wrong so that the mistake doesn't happen again and harm everyone."
3001,51,0,40,ISTP,1,<no>  I don't like meeting new people. The reason is because I hate awkwardness.
3002,51,0,40,ISTP,2,"<no>  I try to get enough rest in my free time. Current concerns are the international economy, oil prices, war in Ukraine, etc."
3003,51,0,40,ISTP,3,"<no> When I see other people crying, I just wonder why they cry. The reason is that there are no emotions in that situation."
3004,51,0,40,ISTP,4,<no>  I do my best to make sure things don't go wrong. I don't think the reason is wrong.
3005,51,0,40,ISTP,5,"<no>  I'm often under a lot of pressure in a high-pressure environment. Recently, there has been pressure to resolve due to a car crash."
3006,51,0,40,ISTP,6,<Yes>  interact with people I know at parties and events. The reason is that meeting new people is awkward.
3007,51,0,40,ISTP,7,<Yes>  I have to complete one project before another. The reason is that you can't do multiple things at once.
3008,51,0,40,ISTP,8,<no>  I think my emotional ups and downs aren't too bad. Reasons are rational and realistic rather than sentimental.
3009,51,0,40,ISTP,9,<Yes>  prefer to plan a schedule and move according to it. The reason is that electronic tools are mainly used for mobile phones.
3010,51,0,40,ISTP,10,<no>  I believe that human abilities vary from person to person and that humans are capable of making mistakes. The reason is that there is no recent experience.
3011,51,0,40,ISTP,11,"<no>  Even if I am interested, I find it difficult to have a conversation. The reason is unfamiliar, so most of them can't have a conversation."
3012,51,0,40,ISTP,12,<Yes>  am not interested or interested in looking at a work of art. The reason is that interpreting or discussing is a waste of time.
3013,51,0,40,ISTP,13,<Yes>  I think I am rational even when I make my own judgments. The reason is that the surrounding evaluation is also similar.
3014,51,0,40,ISTP,14,<no>  I prefer not to deviate from my schedule for the day.
3015,51,0,40,ISTP,15,<no>  I think I am me. The reason is because I think it's very important.
3016,51,0,40,ISTP,16,"<no>  By nature, I prefer to move alone or to do activities alone. These days, I still prefer individual activities rather than group activities."
3017,51,0,40,ISTP,17,<no>  I like books and movies with a clear ending. My recent favorite is Top Gun 2.
3018,51,0,40,ISTP,18,"<no>  My success is more important than helping others. The reason is that if I succeed, I can help others."
3019,51,0,40,ISTP,19,<no>  I try not to pay attention to many things. The reason is because it is a personality that can't do many things.
3020,51,0,40,ISTP,20,"<no>  Because when I do my job, I try to do my best. Reason thinks the result of work rather than being wrong."
3021,51,0,40,ISTP,21,<Yes>  I like to avoid the role of leader as much as possible. The reason is that I feel the burden of being noticed and being responsible.
3022,51,0,40,ISTP,22,<Yes>  I think I am rational rather than emotional by nature. The reason is that there is no inspiration even when looking at a work of art.
3023,51,0,40,ISTP,23,"<no>  I think there is a difference between the two emotions. The reason is that emotions are important, and reason is also important."
3024,51,0,40,ISTP,24,<Yes>  I want to finish my chores before going to bed. The reason is for complete relaxation.
3025,51,0,40,ISTP,25,<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is to know what the person is thinking.
3026,51,0,40,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  I am very burdened with attention from others. The reason is that when you get attention, you get embarrassed."
3027,51,0,40,ISTP,27,<no>  I try not to change the emotional ups and downs as much as possible. The reason is that the ups and downs of emotions themselves are stressful.
3028,51,0,40,ISTP,28,<no>  I'm not interested in other people's inefficient work. The reason is that the work process is based on individual characteristics.
3029,51,0,40,ISTP,29,<Yes>  I think it's laziness or that the matter isn't important enough to be dealt with quickly. I've recently put off making phone calls to government offices.
3030,51,0,40,ISTP,30,<Yes>  I am interested in the afterlife. The reason is because we are curious about where humans come from and where they are going.
3031,51,0,40,ISTP,31,"<no>  I feel comfortable and free when I am alone. These days, too, I prefer to be alone."
3032,51,0,40,ISTP,32,"<Yes>  Practical practical things are more important to me than theory. In terms of experience, stock investment is more important than practical investment experience."
3033,51,0,40,ISTP,33,<neutrality>  I have yet to meet anyone with a completely different background. The reason is that I do not prefer meeting strangers.
3034,51,0,40,ISTP,34,<no>  I make decisions quickly and boldly. The reason is mainly when planning a trip.
3035,51,0,40,ISTP,35,"<Yes>  Once I've made a decision, I don't go back or think about it again. I think the reason is unnecessary energy consumption."
3036,51,0,40,ISTP,36,<no>  I like to spend time alone to relieve fatigue. The reason is that alone time is comfortable. So too today
3037,51,0,40,ISTP,37,<no>  I think going to a museum and looking at art is a waste of time. I don't think the reason is an actual action.
3038,51,0,40,ISTP,38,<Yes>  It's hard for me to understand how other people are impressed by a flower or a work of art. I don't think the reason is an actual action.
3039,51,0,40,ISTP,39,<Yes>  I prefer to go through my day in a planned way. The reason is because it is effective in terms of work efficiency.
3040,51,0,40,ISTP,40,"<no>  There are times when I suddenly feel anxious. It's not a natural tendency, but when I think about the future, I sometimes do. The reason gets worse with age."
3041,51,0,40,ISTP,41,<Yes>  I still feel awkward talking on the phone. The reason is that I prefer face-to-face conversation.
3042,51,0,40,ISTP,42,<no>  I try to respect opinions that are different from mine rather than understanding them. My recent experience is a conversation with someone with different political views.
3043,51,0,40,ISTP,43,<no>  I like to be alone. The reason is because you are free and peaceful when you are alone.
3044,51,0,40,ISTP,44,"<no>  If my plans go wrong, I amend them right away. Recently, I went on a trip and changed my schedule abruptly."
3045,51,0,40,ISTP,45,"<no>  Rather than regretting it, I think about what it would have been like if I had made a different choice. The reason is that these days stock investment is like that."
3046,51,0,40,ISTP,46,<no>  I sometimes think about human existence. The reason is because we think about whether only humans exist in this wide universe.
3047,51,0,40,ISTP,47,"<no>  I try to control my emotions. The reason is that unwanted accidents can happen if you are swayed by your emotions, and evaluations around you usually say that you control your emotions."
3048,51,0,40,ISTP,48,<no>  speak directly when the other person's fault is clear. The reason is that I don't feel the need to save face.
3061,52,0,40,ISFJ,1,<no>  I don't make new friends because I try to spend a lot of time at home.
3062,52,0,40,ISFJ,2,"<Yes>  I like to learn, so I am exposed to a lot of different things. These days, I am very interested in the field of art design."
3063,52,0,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes> When I see someone else crying, I tend to cry with them. It seems that I feel that way when I empathize with a difficult situation."
3064,52,0,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to think about all situations in advance and act accordingly. Because I think about various situations in advance, I think about countermeasures for problems and try to reduce variables."
3065,52,0,40,ISFJ,5,"<Yes>  tend to keep my composure well because I think of myself first in every situation. Even at my father-in-law's funeral, the thought of ending the funeral well came first rather than sadness."
3066,52,0,40,ISFJ,6,"<neutrality>  It depends on why you attend the event, but I think I'll do it if I have to meet new people, and I'll talk to people I know the rest of the time."
3067,52,0,40,ISFJ,7,"<Yes>  When I have a lot of things in my head, I can't organize them well. So, I prefer to process them one by one in order."
3068,52,0,40,ISFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I tend to have a lot of emotional changes. However, it seems to be different depending on the situation because the string of reason is not always let go."
3069,52,0,40,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  There are many cases where I have to make a list and execute it, so I tend to write down what I have to do that day in a diary or notebook, and do it as it is."
3070,52,0,40,ISFJ,10,"<neutrality> Because there is always a vagueness about the field I don't know, if I give an incorrect answer, I tend to turn around a little and regret it a lot. That's why I tend to say a lot that I don't know."
3071,52,0,40,ISFJ,11,"<Yes>  I guess I'm on the easy side. When I say hello to people I don't know, most of them accept it, so I just have to say things I've prepared in advance after saying hello, and it's awkward to have the conversation cut off, but I think it's because I can tolerate that much."
3072,52,0,40,ISFJ,12,"<Yes> Because subjective evaluations of works of art are different, there are many cases where people only talk about themselves, so I don¡¯t want to talk about it."
3073,52,0,40,ISFJ,13,"<neutrality>  It will depend on the situation, but I often judge rationally when it comes to relationships with others, and act emotionally when it comes to my own affairs. I think it's because I'm not self-objectifying."
3074,52,0,40,ISFJ,14,"<neutrality>  prefer to plan, but when I find something I really want to do, I seem to act faithfully to my heart rather than planning."
3075,52,0,40,ISFJ,15,"<Yes>  I think I should be satisfied when I see myself rather than how others see me. You have to meet my standards to be satisfied. Because after living, I thought that people didn't really care about me, and I also didn't really care about others."
3076,52,0,40,ISFJ,16,"<neutrality>  If my favorite activity is a group activity, of course I would enjoy it. However, it is an activity that I don't really want to do, but if I have to, I think it would be better to do a small group activity rather than a group. I guess it depends on what kind of activity it is."
3077,52,0,40,ISFJ,17,"<no>  don't like books with open endings because the reading itself is meant to satisfy my curiosity. So these days, it seems that I mostly read social science books that have no ending."
3078,52,0,40,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I want to contribute to the success of others, but I also want to share in my own success."
3079,52,0,40,ISFJ,19,"<Yes>  Recently, I've been studying marketing, so I'm curious about design, history, and other curiosity, so I'm still thinking about what to do first."
3080,52,0,40,ISFJ,20,"<Yes>  Maybe it's because I tend to think before I act, so I tend to imagine the worst possible scenario for my actions. I think that's why I worry even more."
3081,52,0,40,ISFJ,21,"<neutrality> Leaders in small organizations are something you want to avoid, but in large organizations you don't want to be avoided. This is because large organizations often have to follow the rules, so I think I can handle it well because I think it's important to follow the rules and procedures."
3082,52,0,40,ISFJ,22,"<neutrality>  I used to think I had no artistic inclinations, but recently I've come to think that such an inclination is also an area of mine that has not been discovered, so I don't think I don't have artistic inclinations. If you develop it, I think you can develop that tendency."
3083,52,0,40,ISFJ,23,"<Yes>  If I had only rational thinking, I think it would have become a world of weak meat, like the world of animals. Then the development of machines would have come faster, and I think the development of capitalism would have been faster. I think the answer will be different depending on where you put the standard of a better world."
3084,52,0,40,ISFJ,24,<Yes>  think you can't get a good rest if you leave things to do. So I think I'll try to finish everything and rest comfortably.
3085,52,0,40,ISFJ,25,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the subject. If it's a topic I like, I'll be interested in it, but if it's not, I don't think I'll be interested."
3086,52,0,40,ISFJ,26,"<neutrality>  Normally, I try not to attract attention, but when I want someone to recommend me, I want to attract attention naturally without being awkward."
3087,52,0,40,ISFJ,27,"<Yes>  Even when you are living a peaceful life, you suddenly feel bad the moment you smell the cigarette of the young man next door. It seems like things change quickly."
3088,52,0,40,ISFJ,28,"<Yes> You decide what you need to do first and do it in order, but I think that way when I see you thinking about it every time and making a decision and then overturning it. Even when I go to the mart, I think it's more like that when I see them deciding what to buy in advance and worrying about what they see."
3089,52,0,40,ISFJ,29,"<no>  Because I prioritize what needs to be done, I rarely put it off until the end. It's better to finish first and relax."
3090,52,0,40,ISFJ,30,<no>  I go to church and believe in God. I am living my life with hope in heaven rather than in the afterlife.
3091,52,0,40,ISFJ,31,"<Yes>  My job is a job I do alone, and since I'm raising children, I want to meet other people and play, and that feeling seems to be bigger these days."
3092,52,0,40,ISFJ,32,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the topic in question. For example, when it comes to stock investment, even if you know a lot in theory, there are many things that people who have never actually bought stocks cannot know. So I guess it depends on the subject."
3093,52,0,40,ISFJ,33,<no>  People don't care about other people's lives. And I'm not interested unless other people are greater than me. So I don't think it's easy to empathize.
3094,52,0,40,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  There are times when I make quick decisions, but there are times when I delay making decisions as much as possible depending on the matter. It seems to depend on the content of the decision."
3095,52,0,40,ISFJ,35,"<Yes>  I tend to make decisions or plan after thinking enough, and that's why I don't think it's bothersome to think about decisions again. If you're thinking about it, it's probably because you're undecided."
3096,52,0,40,ISFJ,36,"<no>  These days, I think I'm just trying to rest. When I was in my 20s, I enjoyed parties and events, but not these days. After a party, only regrets remain."
3097,52,0,40,ISFJ,37,"<neutrality>  Recently, when I look at the works of artists, there are things that come to mind, so I do not appreciate them consciously, but I still try to appreciate them."
3098,52,0,40,ISFJ,38,"<Yes>  don't have much interest in other people's lives, so I don't think I understand a little about experiences I haven't experienced myself. I didn't think or experience that my friend's mother drank and behaved badly, so I couldn't sympathize with her."
3099,52,0,40,ISFJ,39,"<Yes>  If you don't plan, you often procrastinate while working. So, I tend to decide what to do as much as possible."
3100,52,0,40,ISFJ,40,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. Still, I tend to accept it calmly, so I don¡¯t show my anxiety."
3101,52,0,40,ISFJ,41,"<neutrality>  These days, I don't have much to answer the phone, so I want to avoid making calls, but it's not to the point of refusal, so it doesn't seem to bother me too much."
3102,52,0,40,ISFJ,42,"<no>  I'm the type to admit that I'm different and I'm not very interested in other people's lives, so I can sympathize with others' thoughts, but I don't spend time separately."
3103,52,0,40,ISFJ,43,"<neutrality>  Since I'm raising a child, it's not easy to ask to meet first. I don't like breaking the pattern of my life."
3104,52,0,40,ISFJ,44,"<neutrality>  It will depend on the situation, but when things go wrong, I tend to revise or remake rather than go back to the plan."
3105,52,0,40,ISFJ,45,"<no>  If I make a mistake, I try to fix it right away, so I think there are many cases where there are no old mistakes or they are forgotten."
3106,52,0,40,ISFJ,46,<neutrality>  It seems that I think first about my existence and the reason for my life rather than the reason for human existence and life. Then it seems to think of human existence.
3107,52,0,40,ISFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I thought I was good at controlling my emotions, but I also tend to be swayed a lot. It seems to depend on the case. There are times when I work as if nothing happened, but there are times when I can't do anything because of that regret."
3108,52,0,40,ISFJ,48,"<neutrality>  I don't care much about the face of others, but if my wife did something wrong, I think I would care about her face."
3121,53,0,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  To make new friends, I usually have to have a drink, but since I hate alcohol, I don't try to make new friends regularly."
3122,53,0,30,ISTJ,2,"<no>  In my free time, I usually spend time lying down and watching TV programs, so I don't spend time exploring various interests. My interest these days is data labeling, which I learned about a few months ago."
3123,53,0,30,ISTJ,3,"<no>  When we see others crying, we think about why they are crying. In this situation, I also feel down."
3124,53,0,30,ISTJ,4,"<Yes>  Before I do anything, I always think of a contingency plan in case something goes wrong. It's because if you don't do that, your anxiety will increase."
3125,53,0,30,ISTJ,5,"<no>  I'm the nervous type, so it's not easy to maintain my composure in a high-pressure environment. I couldn't keep my composure during the interview, so I couldn't answer properly."
3126,53,0,30,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  I have the idea that to introduce myself to a new person first, I have to be someone who has a lot to say, so I tend to talk to people I already know, who don't have much to say."
3127,53,0,30,ISTJ,7,"<neutrality>  Depends on project specifics. Even if you have a project you're working on, if it's a simple project that doesn't take much time, take the time."
3128,53,0,30,ISTJ,8,"<neutrality>  Unlike people who cry every time they see a sad scene, they empathize and feel sad together only when they are deeply immersed."
3129,53,0,30,ISTJ,9,"<Yes>  have to write it down as a schedule or list so I don't forget it and feel comfortable, so I write down important schedules in my cell phone diary, and write down general things on a memo pad."
3130,53,0,30,ISTJ,10,"<no>  If you doubt your ability or knowledge even with a small mistake, you blame yourself when you make a mistake in the middle of your work, and believe without doubting that your work will not make progress."
3131,53,0,30,ISTJ,11,"<no> If you are interested in someone, you have a hard time approaching and starting a conversation with the idea that you need to be more careful about every word. It was difficult to start a conversation with most of the people I was interested in, but after talking, we quickly became close."
3132,53,0,30,ISTJ,12,"<Yes>  It is natural for a work of art to have various interpretations, and I only care about what I interpret and accept."
3133,53,0,30,ISTJ,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason because there is nothing to gain from doing it emotionally. I often hear from friends around me that I am very rational.
3134,53,0,30,ISTJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan my day well rather than improvise. Seeing that whenever my friends asked me to go on a trip, I would suggest making a plan."
3135,53,0,30,ISTJ,15,"<no>  I tend to worry about who I look to others. When meeting other people, I never wear sloppy clothes and dress carefully."
3136,53,0,30,ISTJ,16,"<no>  Doesn't enjoy participating in group activities. These days, I'm trying to avoid group activities because of Corona."
3137,53,0,30,ISTJ,17,"<Yes>  I like movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. It's been a while since it came out, but I recently watched a movie called Inception, and I like it because I can interpret the ending in my own way."
3138,53,0,30,ISTJ,18,"<no> For my parents, my own success is my top priority, so I don't feel much satisfaction in helping others succeed rather than myself."
3139,53,0,30,ISTJ,19,"<no>  If you're into one thing, you're the type to focus only on that one thing, so you don't have much interest in it. A recent concern is data labeling."
3140,53,0,30,ISTJ,20,"<Yes>  Everything has to do with someone else or other things, so I often worry about doing damage if things go wrong."
3141,53,0,30,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  In a group, the leader has to decide the role of the group members, and each member has to take care of each member."
3142,53,0,30,ISTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I have a talent for piano music, but I don't have any talent for drawing art, so I think my artistic inclination is half and half."
3143,53,0,30,ISTJ,23,"<Yes>  When emotions take precedence over reason, quarrels and fights often occur, so I think the world would have been a little better if reason was more important than emotions."
3144,53,0,30,ISTJ,24,<Yes>  You want to get your chores done before you go to rest so you can rest and relax without worrying about chores that need to be done.
3145,53,0,30,ISTJ,25,"<no> When I look at other people's arguments, most of them are not controversial, but I feel uncomfortable because there are many cases of arguing."
3146,53,0,30,ISTJ,26,"<Yes>  When I look at the side of me who thinks very negatively about gwanjong, I tend not to attract other people's attention."
3147,53,0,30,ISTJ,27,"<no>  They are rational rather than emotional, so their emotions do not change quickly. In an angry situation, rather than raising your voice or revealing it with facial expressions, calmly resolve the issue."
3148,53,0,30,ISTJ,28,"<no>  Whenever I see someone who is not as efficient as me, I help them by thinking of my tadpole enemy rather than getting annoyed."
3149,53,0,30,ISTJ,29,"<no>  As before, I rarely procrastinate until the end out of anxiety that I might not be able to finish the task if I put it off until the end."
3150,53,0,30,ISTJ,30,<no>  am not interested in the afterlife itself because it is a busy reality to focus only on my life that is present.
3151,53,0,30,ISTJ,31,"<no>  I like to spend time alone rather than spending time with other people. These days, I want to spend more time alone due to Corona."
3152,53,0,30,ISTJ,32,<Yes>  I lost interest in my major because I felt bored because I was only filled with principled stories without practice during my major subject classes at university.
3153,53,0,30,ISTJ,33,"<no>  There were many things in my life where I couldn¡¯t easily relate to people with similar backgrounds, so I couldn¡¯t easily relate to people whose backgrounds were 180 degrees completely different from mine."
3154,53,0,30,ISTJ,34,"<Yes>  Since I have a prudent personality, I tend to make decisions by thinking about things until the last minute."
3155,53,0,30,ISTJ,35,"<Yes> Before making a decision about something, I think a lot before making a decision, so I don't think twice about the decision I made with trust."
3156,53,0,30,ISTJ,36,"<no>  Parties and events are usually accompanied by alcohol, so as I hate alcohol, I spend time alone to relieve the fatigue of the week. These days, I'm spending time alone at home because of Corona, and I'm relieving my fatigue."
3157,53,0,30,ISTJ,37,<no>  don't like going to art galleries or art galleries because I'm not interested in appreciating art.
3158,53,0,30,ISTJ,38,"<no>  I've always tried to think from the other person's point of view, so I don't think it's hard to understand other people's feelings."
3159,53,0,30,ISTJ,39,"<Yes>  Improvisation can be risky, so I prefer to make a plan when doing work or personal things."
3160,53,0,30,ISTJ,40,"<no> Every time I do something, I try to do it well with a sense of responsibility, but I feel vague anxiety about what to do if I can¡¯t do it here."
3161,53,0,30,ISTJ,41,"<Yes>  In face-to-face, I can have a conversation by looking at the other person's expression and reading their emotions, but I want to avoid talking on the phone because I have to understand the other person's emotions only through their voice."
3162,53,0,30,ISTJ,42,<no>  I do not try to understand the case of a very different opinion even if it is different from mine.
3163,53,0,30,ISTJ,43,"<no>  When I think about when I would have a meeting with my friends, I didn't contact them first. Thankfully, my friends contacted me to meet first, so I met them."
3164,53,0,30,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  I set up a plan to memorize 25 English words a day, but if I couldn't memorize them because of one day's work, I memorized 50 words the next day, including the previous day."
3165,53,0,30,ISTJ,45,"<no>  I try to think of regrettable mistakes from a long time ago, but nothing really comes to mind."
3166,53,0,30,ISTJ,46,"<Yes>  It's because I don't think deeply about human existence and the reason for living, and I simply think that the reason for my life is me and my parents."
3167,53,0,30,ISTJ,47,"<no>  I'm more rational than emotional, so I tend to control myself well without being swayed by my emotions. I heard from people around me that I am not easily swayed by emotions."
3168,53,0,30,ISTJ,48,"<no> If the other person's fault is ambiguous, there is a possibility, but when it is obvious, I think it is right to admit the fault and do not try to save face."
3181,54,0,40,INTJ,1,<Yes>  I meet new friends regularly. The reason is that making new friends through new meetings is a lot of things to get help for in unfamiliar fields.
3182,54,0,40,INTJ,2,"<Yes>  I like to explore different interests. These days, I tend to study a lot about investment techniques such as real estate stocks and coins for my retirement."
3183,54,0,40,INTJ,3,"<no>  I don't want to cry. I empathize with you, but I want you to try to solve the problem rather than cry."
3184,54,0,40,INTJ,4,<Yes>  I tend to make several preparations. There were many times when I was embarrassed and made the wrong decision. I believe that any problem can be solved if you prepare in advance.
3185,54,0,40,INTJ,5,"<Yes>  tend to keep my composure. The stock market has recently plummeted, but I believe that there will be another opportunity because I believe that there will be a bigger loss if I decide because the pressure is severe, so I wait for the right time."
3186,54,0,40,INTJ,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I know. Talking to people you don't know is risky, so talking to people you know and being introduced through them is trustworthy."
3187,54,0,40,INTJ,7,<no>  tend to work on several projects at the same time. Drafting a project and doing other things helps me find new ideas.
3188,54,0,40,INTJ,8,"<no>  I'm on the rational side. It's because if you don't clearly see the facts and judge rationally, you can make a mistake at an important moment."

3191,54,0,40,INTJ,11,"<Yes>  It's easy for me to approach people I'm interested in. I am confident in reaching out to people I am interested in. I'm not close to everyone, but most of the people I want to be close to."
3192,54,0,40,INTJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in debating the interpretation of works of art. Interpreting a work is related to one's own life, so I think it's important to feel and accept it."
3193,54,0,40,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. I try to make rational decisions, and people around me sometimes say that I am cold-hearted."

3197,54,0,40,INTJ,17,"<Yes>  I like packs where you can interpret the ending in your own way. The reason is because I like to imagine. Not recently, but I like Inception."
3198,54,0,40,INTJ,18,<Yes>  I find greater satisfaction in helping others succeed. I think it's more difficult than succeeding. I value the feedback I receive after success.
3199,54,0,40,INTJ,19,<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly. I usually have various thoughts in advance. I usually decide what to choose from the lunch menu.
3200,54,0,40,INTJ,20,"<no>  I tend not to worry. Looking back, I always think that when I did my best in the process, the results followed."
3201,54,0,40,INTJ,21,<no>  I don't want to shirk the leadership role. It's because I feel valued when I take the initiative rather than following someone else's plan.
3202,54,0,40,INTJ,22,<no>  I think you have artistic inclinations. I enjoy coming up with various plans when looking at a situation. I think that is also an area of art.
3203,54,0,40,INTJ,23,<Yes>  I think it would have been a better world. I've seen and heard a lot of things that go wrong when you're emotional about all the important thoughts.
3204,54,0,40,INTJ,24,"<Yes>  want to finish the housework first. It's frustrating to think that if I don't do it once, I'll keep pushing back. I tend to do the dishes right away."
3205,54,0,40,INTJ,25,<no>  I don't want to see an argument. It's more fun doing it yourself than arguing or exercising or having someone else do it.
3206,54,0,40,INTJ,26,<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. This is because spending time quietly thinking about this and that and doing work is the most efficient and results are good.
3207,54,0,40,INTJ,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change quickly. Even when I hear a surprising situation with my friends, I tend to find a solution rather than being surprised."
3208,54,0,40,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who aren't efficient. Even if you tell me how to do it faster, there are many cases that don't work. So I tend to ignore the situation."
3209,54,0,40,INTJ,29,"<no>  hate being pressed for time. It's better to finish it leisurely the day before. Even when I write a report and present it, I tend to finish it the day before."
3210,54,0,40,INTJ,30,<no>  The question of the afterlife is not interesting. I think reality is important. I think life is about living each day happily and ending it.
3211,54,0,40,INTJ,31,"<Yes>  I want to spend time alone. When I'm working, I'm with other people, but during break time, I want to do things by myself without saying anything."
3212,54,0,40,INTJ,32,"<no>  I like original stories. I believe that if you know the theory, you can understand the things of the world. When I was studying business administration, I thought it lacked depth because it was experience-oriented. After studying psychology, I enjoyed studying it because it is a scientific discipline based on theory."
3213,54,0,40,INTJ,33,<no>  can't easily empathize. I think it's far-fetched to say that I understand something I haven't been through. I can only empathize with you if you have been through the situation.

3218,54,0,40,INTJ,38,"<Yes> It's hard to understand. Recently, a company employee complained about the company, and I tried to solve it, but I experienced that the situation got worse and worse."
3219,54,0,40,INTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to do planned things. If I am suddenly given another task, I do not want to do it because I think it is not my job because it was unplanned."
3220,54,0,40,INTJ,40,"<Yes>  try not to feel insecure. In the past, when I first started investing in stocks, I often bought and sold out of anxiety, and suffered big losses. Seeing the loss firsthand made me realize that composure is important."
3221,54,0,40,INTJ,41,<no>  I don't want to avoid phone calls. There is a limit to understanding the text. I think it's important to clearly understand the situation through phone calls.
3222,54,0,40,INTJ,42,<no>  don't try to understand other opinions. Just because you understand someone who has a different opinion doesn't mean you're in favor of that opinion. I think it's different and I think so.

3224,54,0,40,INTJ,44,"<Yes> If there is a problem with the plan, I want to get back to it as soon as possible. I came to the last minute preparing for a new business, but failure was expected. It was a waste of time, but I dared to turn everything over and start over."
3225,54,0,40,INTJ,45,"<no>  I don't regret my old mistakes. I thought the recent turnover result was not good, but even if I didn't make a good decision, I learned something in the process, and I think I'll make a better decision next time through that."
3226,54,0,40,INTJ,46,"<no>  don't think deeply about the reason for existence and life. Because there is no answer. Anyway, it is important to live in the present and what to do in the present."
3227,54,0,40,INTJ,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions. I hear a lot about being calm when fighting. Rather than getting angry, I try to understand the situation better."
3228,54,0,40,INTJ,48,<Yes>  I try to save face. Because moving forward is more important than blaming what has already happened.
3241,55,0,40,ISFJ,1,"<no>  Because of my introverted personality, it is difficult to make regular friends. I usually invest a lot of time in making friends."
3242,55,0,40,ISFJ,2,"<no>  Since I have children, even if I want to try something with interest, I tend to put up with it because circumstances don't follow me. Interest is sports, but it's hard to corona."
3243,55,0,40,ISFJ,3,"<neutrality>  It seems to change depending on the situation. When my paternal grandmother passed away not too long ago, I shed tears when my relatives cried, but I don't think there are usually cases where I want to cry out of personal grief."
3244,55,0,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes> When dealing with everything, I tend to think of the opposite case a lot. I tend to make preparations because I don't like the disappointment of those around me and myself when I can't handle the tasks or tasks given to me."
3245,55,0,40,ISFJ,5,"<no> It depends on the level of pressure, but I tend to not be able to maintain my composure. If an accident occurs due to someone else's fault or my fault, I get angry, and if things don't go my way, I tend to lose my composure. The recent accident caused a lot of disruption to the schedule during the trip to Jeju Island due to the typhoon, so I was under a lot of pressure."
3246,55,0,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  I don't participate in many events, but if I do, most of them are with close acquaintances, and I don't like being introduced or appealing myself to someone."
3247,55,0,40,ISFJ,7,"<Yes>  When I am working on a single project, I tend to focus only on it. When given a job within the company, it is the personality that handles that job first and looks for other work. I think it's too risky to do both at the same time."

3256,55,0,40,ISFJ,16,"<no> First of all, I don't like group activities. It seems that the last time I remember doing group activities other than inevitable social life was during my college days. These days, Corona is bad, so I'm more careful about outside activities, so I'm more self-control."
3257,55,0,40,ISFJ,17,"<Yes>  The Gokseong is the most impressive and interesting movie I have ever seen. This movie is a scene where each person's judgment is right at the end, so I watched it while interpreting it in my own way."
3258,55,0,40,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality>  Since I am a person, I feel great satisfaction with my own success, but I also feel satisfaction with supporting the success of others in general matters."
3259,55,0,40,ISFJ,19,"<no> Since my favorite interests have been fixed for some time in my life, there are not many new things, so there are few cases where I don't know what to do.

3263,55,0,40,ISFJ,23,"<neutrality>  I don't know if there's a law that says that, but I don't know if it's because my inclination is that emotions come first, but I don't think reason or emotions come first. Sometimes emotions come first, and sometimes reason comes first."

3270,55,0,40,ISFJ,30,"<no>  I don't believe in things I haven't seen with my own eyes, so I'm not curious or interested in the afterlife. That's why I believed in religion when I was young, but now I don't."

3326,56,1,30,ISTP,26,"<no>  I do not intentionally avoid attention or avoid it because I do not like being focused. Rather, it seems more sad that there is too little presence in others."
3327,56,1,30,ISTP,27,"<no>  Emotional ups and downs are not great. Even if I experience temporary emotional changes on the inside, I tend to try not to show my emotions well on the outside."
3328,56,1,30,ISTP,28,"<no>  don't get annoyed by comparing myself to others or being less efficient than myself, perhaps because I don't care too much about them. I tend to try to indirectly inform the other person of a more efficient method so as not to make them feel bad."
3329,56,1,30,ISTP,29,"<no>  I tend to think time is important in life, so if I have to do something anyway, I don¡¯t hesitate to postpone it."
3330,56,1,30,ISTP,30,"<neutrality>  I believe that there is an afterlife, but I still live in the present reality, so I don't think it will be too late to worry about the afterlife when I go to the afterlife."
3331,56,1,30,ISTP,31,"<no>  I absolutely need time to be alone, and I tend to enjoy my alone time well. It is the same both in the past and now."
3332,56,1,30,ISTP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not really interested in theoretical discussions, and if it's not a topic I'm interested in, I'm sure I'll get bored with the theoretical discussion."
3333,56,1,30,ISTP,33,"<neutrality>  think I can easily pretend to empathize. It may be a little different depending on the type of background, but I don't think it will show off even if I can't actually sympathize with it."
3334,56,1,30,ISTP,34,"<no>  I'm not the type to procrastinate anything. If it's something I have to decide and it's something I have to do, I don't bother putting it off."
3335,56,1,30,ISTP,35,"<Yes>  I don't reconsider what I've decided. I hate situations where I feel regret and upset because I think about an irreversible situation. For example, don't search for the lowest price on something you've already bought."
3336,56,1,30,ISTP,36,"<no>  I don't like gatherings or events. Meetings with very close friends are good, but I don't enjoy group gatherings or parties. It's good to relieve the fatigue of the week by spending your own time."
3337,56,1,30,ISTP,37,"<no>  I don't think I've ever been to an art gallery. Any work of art is subjective, so I don't particularly appreciate it, and I tend to look for styles I'm interested in or like."
3338,56,1,30,ISTP,38,"<no>  I seem to have the ability to empathize, and I don't think I've ever felt the hardship of not understanding the other person."
3339,56,1,30,ISTP,39,"<Yes>  It's not as planned, but I prefer a life with a daily routine. The basic routine of the day, such as getting up at the same time in the morning and exercising and doing home care, is rather well-organized."
3340,56,1,30,ISTP,40,<Yes> It seems that I did not live with a lot of anxiety in my tendency. It seems to be in a similar context to the tendency not to worry in advance about things that have not happened.
3341,56,1,30,ISTP,41,"<Yes>  I tend to prefer text messages rather than phone calls, and I rarely make phone calls except for urgent matters."
3342,56,1,30,ISTP,42,"<no>  Everyone thinks that everyone can have a different opinion, and they don't spend much time trying to understand or make others understand. I tend to quickly admit differences and seek compromises or solutions quickly."
3343,56,1,30,ISTP,43,"<no>  It seems not. Even close friends rarely contact me first, and I tend to answer them when they do."
3344,56,1,30,ISTP,44,"<neutrality>  If there is a setback in the plan, I tend to quickly select and implement the next best solution. If the plan has already gone wrong, it is difficult to go back, so it would be better to immediately face the reality and quickly find the next best solution."
3345,56,1,30,ISTP,45,"<neutrality>  Rather than regretting mistakes, we regret when we are still not achieving goals that we missed a long time ago. I feel that way when the plans I make at the beginning of the year don't come true at the end of the year."
3346,56,1,30,ISTP,46,"<Yes>  If I am satisfied with my current life and enjoy it, I will try to live it, but I have never thought about the reason for my existence."
3347,56,1,30,ISTP,47,"<no>  tend to control my emotions. There are times when I get swayed by my emotions on the inside, but I try to control myself as much as possible. In particular, I try not to show it well on the outside."
3348,56,1,30,ISTP,48,"<no>  If there is an unavoidable circumstance to save the person's face, it would be, but in general, there seems to be no reason to do so."
3361,57,1,40,ISFP,1,<no>  I don't make new friends regularly. This is because being in a new environment is stressful.
3362,57,1,40,ISFP,2,<no>  I don't spend much of my free time exploring my interests. The reason is the lack of a variety of new interests.
3363,57,1,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  I often want to cry when other people cry. I tend to empathize, so I get sad quickly when others are sad."
3364,57,1,40,ISFP,4,"<neutrality> I'm anxious when things go wrong, so I try to make a contingency plan, but I can't prepare in many ways."
3365,57,1,40,ISFP,5,<no>  I have trouble maintaining my composure in a high-pressure environment. I can't keep my composure in these situations because I quickly become anxious and depressed.
3366,57,1,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes> At parties and events, I prefer to talk to people I already know rather than new people. The reason is that you are nervous about a new environment or person and rely on someone you know."
3367,57,1,40,ISFP,7,"<Yes>  After I fully complete one project, I start another. The reason is that if I don't finish one thing, I'm anxious, so I want to finish it quickly and move on to another task."
3368,57,1,40,ISFP,8,"<Yes>  am very sentimental. The reason is that I get swayed by my emotions a lot, and even while watching movies or dramas, I easily empathize and fall in love with them."
3369,57,1,40,ISFP,9,<no>  I don't like making plans with schedules or lists. The reason is that they do not use the diary well and do not act preplanned.
3370,57,1,40,ISFP,10,"<neutrality> Sometimes I doubt my ability or knowledge with a small mistake, but usually I just go over it without saying why. Even when there is experimental learning, I first think that there must have been something wrong in the conditional part rather than my mistakes, and then look back on my mistakes."
3371,57,1,40,ISFP,11,"<neutrality>  It's not easy to reach out and strike up a conversation with someone you're interested in, but it's not impossible. It's difficult, but I muster up the courage to talk to you first, and if the conversation goes well, I lead the conversation."
3372,57,1,40,ISFP,12,<Yes>  I am not very interested in discussing the various interpretations of works of art. I'm not interested in interpretation because I'm not really interested in the artwork itself.
3373,57,1,40,ISFP,13,"<no>  I tend to follow emotions rather than reason. Even if you try to act with reason, you are quickly emotionally swayed and often fail to act rationally, so those around you evaluate you as too weak-minded."
3374,57,1,40,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  I like to spontaneously do what I want to do rather than plan my day. The reason is that I am physically weak and follow my emotions a lot, so I tend to do what I want to do according to my mood and condition that day."
3375,57,1,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  I tend to worry about who I look to others. The reason is that when you meet someone else, you try to eat that person's favorite food and go places."
3376,57,1,40,ISFP,16,"<neutrality>  I don't want to voluntarily participate in group activities, but when I do, I tend to work hard not to be left behind. I went to a family sports day not too long ago, and I didn't want to go, but I did my best."
3377,57,1,40,ISFP,17,"<no>  I hate books and movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. Whether it's a happy ending or a sad ending, you have to finish it to feel refreshed."
3378,57,1,40,ISFP,18,"<no>  My success is more important to me than anyone else, and I want others to help me succeed. I am not successful, but I am reluctant to help others succeed."
3379,57,1,40,ISFP,19,"<no>  I don't have many interests. They don't have much interest in games or cartoons that most people enjoy, and they get bored quickly."
3380,57,1,40,ISFP,20,"<Yes>  am often worried that things will go wrong. I don't know why, but I'm afraid of failure, so I don't try."
3381,57,1,40,ISFP,21,<Yes>  I want to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group as much as possible. The reason is that it is burdensome to be in the spotlight and I hate criticism.
3382,57,1,40,ISFP,22,"<neutrality>  I don't like artistic things, so I'm not interested and I'm not good at it. However, I do have a sense for flower arrangement and costume design, so I think there is a partial artistic inclination."
3383,57,1,40,ISFP,23,"<neutrality>  I think the world might or might not be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. However, I think the world can change a lot depending on which reason works more and which emotions apply more."
3384,57,1,40,ISFP,24,"<Yes>  want to finish my chores before going to bed. The reason is that if housework is piled up, you are taking a break, but you can't take a proper break because you think about housework in your head."
3385,57,1,40,ISFP,25,<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that it is fun to judge who is right and who is wrong.
3386,57,1,40,ISFP,26,<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. The reason is that I don't like what I do as a representative and I don't talk loudly.
3387,57,1,40,ISFP,27,"<Yes>  My emotions tend to change very quickly. For example, if you fight with your boyfriend, you may feel like you'll never see him again, but if you apologize, you'll quickly get over it and get back on track."
3388,57,1,40,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed with people who aren't as effective as I am. My mom is similar to me, but when I see her behavior, I often get annoyed with the same frustration."
3389,57,1,40,ISFP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. Recently, I had to take classes at cyber university until Monday, but I had a hard time taking them all at once until Monday."
3390,57,1,40,ISFP,30,<no>  I'm not interested in questions about the afterlife. I'm not interested in the unseen for reasons I'm not sure.
3391,57,1,40,ISFP,31,"<neutrality>  like to be alone at home, but often times I feel so lonely that I look for someone else."
3392,57,1,40,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I find principled stories boring. Discussion is fun when you talk about each other's thoughts and coordinate, but the theory center is boring because it's like reading a book."
3393,57,1,40,ISFP,33,"<no>  don't think I and someone from a completely different background will be able to relate easily. The reason is that I am very emotional, so there are many parts of my actions that are swayed by emotions."
3394,57,1,40,ISFP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone making decisions until the end. So I also think it would be nice if the deadline to make a decision was short. When given a long time, I keep holding it in my head under stress, and then I make a decision at the last minute."
3395,57,1,40,ISFP,35,"<no>  I tend to keep thinking about decisions I've already made. Even though I've already made a decision and can't go back, I'm anxious that it might be a better choice than the one I made."
3396,57,1,40,ISFP,36,"<no>  Alone time is more important. My fatigue and stress occur among people, so I want to do the fatigue of the week alone."
3397,57,1,40,ISFP,37,"<no>  don't like going to art galleries. No matter how famous art museums you go to, they are boring and uninteresting."
3398,57,1,40,ISFP,38,"<no>  I am easy to understand other people's feelings. Maybe it's because I'm more emotional than rational, even when I watch movies or dramas, and when an acquaintance is crying, I can quickly figure out the content and position."
3399,57,1,40,ISFP,39,"<no>  don't like to plan my daily to-dos. The reason is that I am physically weak and follow my emotions a lot, so I tend to do what I want to do according to my mood and condition that day."
3400,57,1,40,ISFP,40,<no>  I often feel insecure. I think it may have been a parental argument.
3401,57,1,40,ISFP,41,<Yes>  I want to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. It is convenient to order online or by text message. Dealing with people is stressful.
3402,57,1,40,ISFP,42,<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. I think my opinion is almost right.
3403,57,1,40,ISFP,43,"<no>  I tend not to contact my friends to meet up first. When a friend asks to meet me, I reluctantly go out, even though it's annoying."
3404,57,1,40,ISFP,44,"<no> When my plan goes wrong, I tend to give up on it rather than go back to it. Even if you go on a trip, if your plans go wrong, you will change all your plans for the day."
3405,57,1,40,ISFP,45,"<Yes>  I often regret mistakes made long ago. These days, I have regrets about meeting people emotionally."
3406,57,1,40,ISFP,46,"<Yes>  don't think deeply about human existence and why we live. Since I already exist and live in this world, I think it is unnecessary to think about the reason for my existence itself."
3407,57,1,40,ISFP,47,"<Yes>  Rather than controlling my emotions, I tend to be swayed by my emotions a lot. He looks very rational, but in the end, he is emotionally swayed and people around him feel sorry for him."
3408,57,1,40,ISFP,48,<no>  tend to criticize when it is clear that the other person is at fault. I think it is a pretentious act to cover up and save face even though there is a mistake.
3421,58,0,40,ESTJ,1,<no>  I don't really try to make new friends. I feel more comfortable hanging out with my old friends.
3422,58,0,40,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  I tend to search with interest in various fields. These days, I am interested in investing and side hustles, as well as auctions and data labeling."
3423,58,0,40,ESTJ,3,"<Yes>  When I see actors crying in a drama or movie, tears flow without my knowledge."
3424,58,0,40,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  I¡¯m the type of person who makes plans by nature, so I tend to analyze things in advance and make preparations if necessary."
3425,58,0,40,ESTJ,5,"<neutrality>  tend to try to keep my composure even in a high pressure environment, but in reality it is not easy to maintain my composure. Recently, I was very nervous when I was reporting the project to company executives."
3426,58,0,40,ESTJ,6,<Yes>  I usually talk to people I already know. I prefer to hang out with people I already know rather than trying to make new ones.
3427,58,0,40,ESTJ,7,"<no> Because I often take on multiple projects with different schedules, due to the nature of my work, it is difficult to complete one project and complete another project, and I have to manage them at the same time."
3428,58,0,40,ESTJ,8,"<no>  I am very biased. Rather than acting based on emotions, I tend to try to act based on rational judgment."
3429,58,0,40,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  I always plan ahead and try to act accordingly. So, I set up a schedule with an Excel file and my cell phone, and I check and update it every day."
3430,58,0,40,ESTJ,10,<no>  I think anyone can make mistakes. I don't doubt my abilities just because I made a small mistake. But I don't think it's okay to repeat the same mistakes.
3431,58,0,40,ESTJ,11,"<Yes>  It was like that before, and I think it is like that now. It's really hard to approach and strike up a conversation with someone you're interested in. That's why even now, I'm just looking at you and loving you unrequitedly."
3432,58,0,40,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in art, nor am I interested in discussing various interpretations of such art. It's because it's not my field of interest."
3433,58,0,40,ESTJ,13,<Yes>  I tend to make decisions rationally and try to act. I think the evaluations around me are similar to mine.
3434,58,0,40,ESTJ,14,"<no>  tend to plan ahead and act accordingly. So, rather than wanting to improvise, I tend to prepare in advance according to a plan and put it into action."
3435,58,0,40,ESTJ,15,<no>  I'm the type of person who tries to show myself as a successful and enviable person to others. So I tend to care about what people around me think of me.
3436,58,0,40,ESTJ,16,<neutrality>  I guess it varies from case to case. I enjoy participating in group activities and spending time doing things alone.
3437,58,0,40,ESTJ,17,"<no>  Usually, I tend to read books and movies that have a fixed ending. I have never tried to interpret the ending in my own way."
3438,58,0,40,ESTJ,18,"<no>  Most of the time, I've been working on my own success. It's rewarding to help others succeed, but I don't think that's the case."
3439,58,0,40,ESTJ,19,"<no>  have so many interests that I'm running out of time, but I don't know what to do next. It's because it goes according to plan."
3440,58,0,40,ESTJ,20,"<no>  I do worry about things going wrong, but not often. Rather than worrying, I tend to try to come up with countermeasures in case things go wrong."
3441,58,0,40,ESTJ,21,"<no>  Being a leader in a group is challenging but rewarding. At university, I served as the head of department and the chairman of Dongiri."
3442,58,0,40,ESTJ,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little talent as well as an artistic inclination. Ever since I was in school, I had no interest in arts and sports, and my grades were not good."
3443,58,0,40,ESTJ,23,<Yes>  The world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. I think the current world came about because I did emotionally wrong things.
3444,58,0,40,ESTJ,24,"<Yes> If I take a break before I finish my chores, I don't think I'll feel properly rested. I think you can take a proper break if you finish what you have to do first and take a break."
3445,58,0,40,ESTJ,25,"<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. Rather, I think it's pathetic. I think it's unproductive and wasteful."
3446,58,0,40,ESTJ,26,<Yes>  I'm not the type to deliberately try to get other people's attention. I usually do my own thing without being noticed.
3447,58,0,40,ESTJ,27,"<no>  Emotions aren't always the same, but I'm not a style where emotions change very quickly. There are many times when the feelings that morning are the same throughout the day."
3448,58,0,40,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see family members who stare at their phones all day, not people like me who make plans and work hard for the future."
3449,58,0,40,ESTJ,29,"<Yes> Usually, there are many times when I put things off until the last minute to get things done. There are times when you don't have enough time or you have to worry until the last minute."
3450,58,0,40,ESTJ,30,<no>  I tend to believe that there is an afterlife. But I don't think the question of the afterlife is interesting. Just thinking about the real world is daunting.
3451,58,0,40,ESTJ,31,"<no>  I prefer to spend time alone. When I study or exercise, I feel more comfortable alone than with other people."
3452,58,0,40,ESTJ,32,<Yes>  I think theory-centered discussions or principled stories are boring. I think specific and realistic stories are more interesting.
3453,58,0,40,ESTJ,33,<no>  I don't think it's easy to form a consensus with someone from a completely different background than mine.
3454,58,0,40,ESTJ,34,"<Yes>  If I have to make a decision, I tend to put it off until the very end and think about it until the end."
3455,58,0,40,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  If it's an irreversible decision, I tend to try not to think about the decision I've already made."
3456,58,0,40,ESTJ,36,"<no>  I rarely unwind after a week, but I prefer to unwind with time alone rather than fun parties and events."
3457,58,0,40,ESTJ,37,<no>  I am not interested in artistic works. That's why I don't like going to art galleries.
3458,58,0,40,ESTJ,38,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. If I feel that other people's feelings are similar to mine, I will understand them, and not vice versa."
3459,58,0,40,ESTJ,39,<Yes>  I'm the type to plan what I'm going to do every day in advance and act according to that plan. Both personal and corporate work.
3460,58,0,40,ESTJ,40,"<neutrality> There are times when I feel insecure, but I don't think I feel that often. I think it's a natural personality and it's a personality that was formed naturally as I grew up."
3461,58,0,40,ESTJ,41,"<no>  If it's something that needs to be resolved by talking on the phone, I'm not the type to deliberately avoid it. If it's something that can only be solved by bumping into it, then bump into it."
3462,58,0,40,ESTJ,42,"<no>  Just because I have a very different opinion, I don't take the time to understand it. I tend to just give up."
3463,58,0,40,ESTJ,43,"<Yes>  Most of the time, I contact my friends first and set up a schedule. So my friends rarely contact me first."
3464,58,0,40,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback in the plan, I tend to try to revise the plan according to the variable that occurred. For example, if someone else's schedule changes, I reschedule to fit that schedule."
3465,58,0,40,ESTJ,45,"<Yes>  often regret mistakes made a long time ago. If I had studied harder at that time, if I had married someone else at that time, I often regret things."
3466,58,0,40,ESTJ,46,<Yes>  I tend to focus more on practical issues. That's why I'm not interested in the essential human existence and the reason for living.
3467,58,0,40,ESTJ,47,"<no>  Rather than being swayed by emotions, I tend to try to control them. I guess people around me think that way too."
3468,58,0,40,ESTJ,48,"<neutrality>  think it depends on the situation. Even if it's clearly the other person's fault, if it's necessary to save face, I'm the type to help make it happen."
3481,59,1,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  When a situation arises, I can create it, but I don't deliberately create a situation first. There is no particular reason."
3482,59,1,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes> Because of my uncertain thoughts about the future, I find a job rather than a hobby or an activity that can remain as income. Since I am older, I tend to focus on studying to prepare for old age."
3483,59,1,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes>  When I see other people crying, there are many times when I am crying with them without even realizing it. Rather than because of a certain situation, it seems that there are many times when the person's expression or emotion at that moment strikes a chord."
3484,59,1,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes>  When I think about it, I think I tend to think a lot about the number of cases of success and failure. I think I have a personality that requires a lot of time, but it's not always like that.. It's because I don't want to create a situation where I'm disappointed in myself."
3485,59,1,40,INFJ,5,"<no>  tend to maintain it, but I think the difference between the level of maintenance between work and work at home is a bit different. At work, even if I get involved in bad things with customers, my colleagues often don't know how I feel, but at home, I'm too much. I don't think it's a style that explodes easily."
3486,59,1,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  I'd rather talk to someone I already know than to someone new at a party or event. The reason seems to be because the new environment itself is stressful, so conversations with people you already know can be a little less stressful."
3487,59,1,40,INFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I think it's a little different depending on the situation. I am neutral because I think that while there are projects that I think can be started even when I am anxious and nervous, there are some projects that I think can be started only when one is finished."
3488,59,1,40,INFJ,8,"<Yes>  seem to be on the fast side with a lot of empathy for my feelings and others. I tend to assimilate well to sad or happy situations and have a lot of thoughts, so I have a lot of tears and laughter."
3489,59,1,40,INFJ,9,"<Yes>  I tend to use my cell phone, computer, and notepad a lot. I try not to forget or miss anything, mainly using a lot of phone apps or tablets."
3490,59,1,40,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  A while ago, a customer told me badly that the contract was extended to 20 years. Even though it has already been 8 years since the contract was signed, rather than thinking that the customer misremembered, I took out all the old data and looked it up to see if there was anything I misunderstood, and pondered all night. have done Of course, even though I know I didn't ask for a 20-year contract, I think there's a loophole I made, so I look back on the whole situation."
3491,59,1,40,INFJ,11,<no>  I think it's difficult for me to approach and start a conversation with someone I'm interested in. It's not slow and easy because I do a lot of research before approaching to find out if there are many common interests or conversations that can continue with me.
3492,59,1,40,INFJ,12,"<Yes>  It's a field I don't know well, and it's good to learn a field I don't know, but since I'm not interested, I can't hear it, so I can't concentrate."
3493,59,1,40,INFJ,13,<neutrality>  It seems different from time to time. It depends on the situation and I think people who know me judge me differently depending on where they know me.
3494,59,1,40,INFJ,14,"<no>  I don't like unexpected situations or impromptu things during the day. It can be interesting when something unexpected happens, but I don't like to mess with my schedule because there were a lot more tiring situations."
3495,59,1,40,INFJ,15,"<no> It may be different from time to time to other people, but I tend to think about how I look. I don't know if there is really no point of contact after seeing it once, but other than that, I tend to think that there is a relationship that can overlap somewhere, so I pay attention. Since I met a lot of people professionally, I basically thought a lot about what they would think of me when I wasn't there."
3496,59,1,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  It seems that there is no other way to participate in group activities other than company work. Because I am busy in reality, I do not participate in special group activities. I have an idea to do it, but it doesn't work."
3497,59,1,40,INFJ,17,"<Yes>  I tend to like content with an open ending that allows you to imagine. Even if there is an ending, I often imagine the story to myself after that. Recently, the Chinese drama ""Cha Si Tianhe"" ended with the main character leaving the throne and living with two people in the mountains, but I imagined the aftermath alone."
3498,59,1,40,INFJ,18,"<no> In the past, I thought that if I helped others succeed, I could succeed as well, but I think it's right that I prioritize myself, perhaps because I'm older. These days, I have a lot of thoughts that I have to succeed, so it's hard to find satisfaction in that kind of work."
3499,59,1,40,INFJ,19,"<Yes>  want to prepare for various certifications, but I couldn't prioritize my interests on what to do first, so I bought a workbook each related to the certifications I was interested in. I thought I might be able to re-set my priorities by reading the book, but it didn't work out."
3500,59,1,40,INFJ,20,<Yes>  I worry a lot about what might go wrong. The reason is that I tend to worry in advance that I will feel the gaze or judgment of others. I hate being ruined or embarrassed.
3501,59,1,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes>  I avoid such roles. It's stressful for me to make mistakes or take on some responsibility. I'm the type of person who gets worried every time I make a small situation or a moment-to-moment judgment, so I want to avoid it as much as possible because I think there will be a situation I can't handle."
3502,59,1,40,INFJ,22,"<Yes>  think I have little artistic inclination or aesthetic sense. I have no interest or interest in music or art, but I may not be able to express it properly, but I am not good at makeup or decorating myself."
3503,59,1,40,INFJ,23,<neutrality>  I don't think the world would have been a good place by focusing on one thing. I think it's more important to properly mix everything.
3504,59,1,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  hope the housework is well done before I go to rest. If something is unfinished, it keeps bothering me, and if it starts bothering me anyway, taking a break won't mean taking a break, so it's better to finish it well and take a break even if it's for a short time."
3505,59,1,40,INFJ,25,"<no>  I don't like looking at other people's arguments. It doesn't matter if the argument comes to a conclusion or ends well, but I'm not happy because I'm worried that we'll end up together because there's a situation where it doesn't, the point is off, or the wrong situation arises."
3506,59,1,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  I hate attracting other people's attention. I hate being uncomfortable. I don't like to be focused. I don't want to make mistakes, show loopholes, or go up and down in a cube."
3507,59,1,40,INFJ,27,"<Yes>  My emotions tend to change very quickly. I tend to laugh and cry. If you meet someone who laughs and stays well and then cries, you may suddenly cry at the same time, even though you don't know the situation."
3508,59,1,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes>  I'm not good at it either, but I tend to bubbling inside even if I don't openly point out things. The male office worker I am with is always complaining and can't manage his time. Even though he is a salesperson, everyone knows that he is not able to work outside of himself. Everyone knows that he is the cause except for himself."
3509,59,1,40,INFJ,29,"<neutrality>  I don't often put things off until the end, but I tend to try to solve them as quickly as possible, but there have been times when I've really been forced to take on someone else's work. It was something that could be solved within the deadline, but I did it as slowly as possible."
3510,59,1,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes>  I was not interested in the question of the afterlife before, but after my father passed away two years ago, I started to think a lot. I wish it was an afterlife where I could choose."
3511,59,1,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  There are many times when I prefer to be alone rather than spend time with others. I don't have much of my own time, so when I do spend time alone, all I do is work, study, or clean, but I want time alone."
3512,59,1,40,INFJ,32,"<neutrality>  I think it's boring when the discussion is focused on one or the other. However, I don't really like discussions or arguments, and I'm not interested."
3513,59,1,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  I may not be able to fully understand a person from a completely different background than mine, but I tend to understand that person's situation or reality. Through conversation, I try to understand the person's behavior or environment more. I think that everyone has their own circumstances, not the same environment."
3514,59,1,40,INFJ,34,"<neutrality> Making decisions isn't easy. Some are easy to make quick decisions, while others are always difficult because of the tendency to procrastinate and procrastinate."
3515,59,1,40,INFJ,35,"<no>  Even if a decision has already been made, I tend to keep thinking about it. Even after making a decision, I think a lot. I think a lot about what would have happened if I had made a different decision."
3516,59,1,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  need some alone time. I don't like noisy things, so parties and events with a lot of people are stressful for me. The only thing to relieve fatigue is to sleep well when you sleep at home."
3517,59,1,40,INFJ,37,"<no>  I think I've been to an art gallery once or twice. not interested. I like painting, but I've never done it specifically to visit or appreciate the work. I don't like it because I can't concentrate when I'm not interested."
3518,59,1,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  am good at understanding other people's feelings. And I'm trying to understand. No matter what the situation, I think the feelings of others are also important."
3519,59,1,40,INFJ,39,"<Yes>  I don't plan every day, but since my job is a sales job, I tend to think about and execute a plan for a month and a day in advance. On the first day of each month, plan for the month, make a daily plan, and make a weekly plan."
3520,59,1,40,INFJ,40,"<no>  I tend to feel insecure. I tend to feel and think every moment. What I see and feel, thinking about what others think of me, seems to have changed as I went through my social life."
3521,59,1,40,INFJ,41,"<Yes>  think it would be better to meet and talk if possible than to make a phone call. I think the range that I can judge by the person's words, facial expressions, and actions is wider. When talking on the phone, I think that the other person can deceive me about emotions or situations with just my voice."
3522,59,1,40,INFJ,42,"<no>  If it differs from my opinion, I try to understand it, but I do not spend much time to understand it."
3523,59,1,40,INFJ,43,"<neutrality>  There are times when I contact a friend asking to meet first, but that's why it's different. It's different whether it's a friend you met in your social life or a friend at school."
3524,59,1,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback in the plan, I try to finish the situation as much as possible and try to fix the remaining schedule or other things. Doesn't seem to have been lately. It's because I don't like unexpected situations, so I don't make them as much as possible."
3525,59,1,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes> There are many times when I regret the mistakes of a long time ago. Now that I've grown to my mother's age and raised my children, I'm still doing the same thing as I did when I overheard my mother's nagging."
3526,59,1,40,INFJ,46,"<Yes>  Living itself is busy to think about human existence and the reason for living, but I don¡¯t think I have time to think about it. I never even thought about it."
3527,59,1,40,INFJ,47,"<neutrality>  think I need to control my emotions, but there are many times when I fail. But it seems to be a little different depending on where you are. During my social life, during my personal life, my friends and family are different from time to time."
3528,59,1,40,INFJ,48,"<neutrality>  When it is obvious that the other person is at fault, it depends on what the situation is like and how that person reacts. It does not unconditionally save face."
3541,60,1,40,ISFJ,1,<no>  It's hard to make new friends because I'm shy and not active.
3542,60,1,40,ISFJ,2,"<no>  When I have free time, I like to be alone and quiet. I don't really like going out and I don't have any hobbies that I'm particularly interested in."
3543,60,1,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  I tend to cry a lot and I tend to empathize. When I see the other person crying, my heart hurts so much and it hurts because I feel like I'm in that situation."
3544,60,1,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to worry in advance what will happen if things don't go the way I want. So, as a workaround, I think of several ways."
3545,60,1,40,ISFJ,5,"<no>  It's a personality that explodes at once, so it's not easy to keep your composure. Explode and hurt others, and you will definitely regret it."
3546,60,1,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes> It's hard to approach someone you don't know first. It may seem too rude, but it's much easier to talk while talking to people you know."
3547,60,1,40,ISFJ,7,<Yes>  Inability to do multiple things at the same time. It feels good to start a new one after completing one perfectly.
3548,60,1,40,ISFJ,8,"<neutrality>  On a daily basis, he behaves rationally. However, there are times when you act sentimental in relationships or private matters."
3549,60,1,40,ISFJ,9,"<no>  I tried many times to write a diary or planner, but it's too cumbersome. It's not like it's written. I tend to act after thinking about what I am going to do today in my head."
3550,60,1,40,ISFJ,10,"<Yes>  Because of their intolerance for mistakes and their propensity to be perfect, they tend to blame themselves a lot if they don't."
3551,60,1,40,ISFJ,11,"<no>  Even if there is someone you are interested in, please talk to them without approaching them first. I don't know how to start, and I feel burdened by such an awkward situation."
3552,60,1,40,ISFJ,12,"<Yes>  I don't even know what art is, and I don't know why they interpret and discuss works of art. I think it's pointless and a waste of time. It feels like a world of their own."
3553,60,1,40,ISFJ,13,"<Yes>  When it comes to work, I tend to act rationally. Seeing that I sometimes hear that I am cold-hearted, it seems that the evaluations around me are similar."
3554,60,1,40,ISFJ,14,"<Yes>  It seems to move mostly spontaneously. If you plan your schedule ahead of time, strangely, when the day comes, you will hate it."
3555,60,1,40,ISFJ,15,"<neutrality>  Rather than worrying, I am curious about how they see me and what kind of person they think I am."
3556,60,1,40,ISFJ,16,"<no>  I prefer alone time rather than group activities. I'm not very active, so I don't like to go out."
3557,60,1,40,ISFJ,17,<no>  I like things with a clear ending. I really hate open endings.
3558,60,1,40,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I feel satisfaction and pride in helping others, but I think my work is just as important."
3559,60,1,40,ISFJ,19,"<no> The problem is that I don't care too much. It's all about watching TV, shopping on the Internet, and watching movies."
3560,60,1,40,ISFJ,20,"<Yes>  Before starting work, I tend to think a lot about what to do if it doesn¡¯t work. It sounds like you have high anxiety."
3561,60,1,40,ISFJ,21,<Yes>  I hate being in the spotlight. It is more comfortable for me to play the role of helping from behind the scenes rather than being a leader.
3562,60,1,40,ISFJ,22,"<Yes>  No artistic inclinations at all. It is a waste of time and money to spend on art exhibitions, performances, etc."
3563,60,1,40,ISFJ,23,"<neutrality>  Emotion and rationality should coexist, not what should be more important."
3564,60,1,40,ISFJ,24,<no>  I tend to postpone housework as much as possible and do it all at once. It is important to take a break first.

3567,60,1,40,ISFJ,27,"<Yes>  When things don't go our way, there are times when our emotions become clear and straight."
3568,60,1,40,ISFJ,28,"<neutrality>  Not so. I just think that ah, that person is similar to me."
3569,60,1,40,ISFJ,29,"<neutrality>  We often put off doing things we don't want to do, such as cleaning the house, sorting garbage, and doing laundry."
3570,60,1,40,ISFJ,30,"<no> There is no afterlife. I don't think it's interesting at all, I think it's a useless question."
3571,60,1,40,ISFJ,31,"<no>  It's good to spend time alone. These days, I like my alone time even more."
3572,60,1,40,ISFJ,32,<Yes>  Certainly nothing is gained by discussion. I don't like it because we just talk about each other's thoughts and don't come to a visible conclusion.
3573,60,1,40,ISFJ,33,"<no> Because the environment in which they have lived is different, empathy is not formed, and they do not try to empathize."
3574,60,1,40,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on what kind of problem it is. I tend to make quick decisions at work, but sometimes I put off personal matters."
3575,60,1,40,ISFJ,35,<no>  I keep thinking about decisions I've already made. I tend to keep worrying about what to do if I did something right or wrong.
3576,60,1,40,ISFJ,36,<no>  It's good to be alone. Parties and events make you more tired just thinking about them. I'm happier watching Netflix alone and eating late-night snacks.
3577,60,1,40,ISFJ,37,"<no>  I don't like it at all. It is a waste of time and money to spend on art galleries, performances, and exhibitions."
3578,60,1,40,ISFJ,38,"<no>  I tend to easily empathize with the thoughts and feelings of others. When others are having a hard time or crying, your heart hurts as well."
3579,60,1,40,ISFJ,39,<no>  I don't like it because it doesn't work out as planned. There are many times when it is flexible to proceed according to the situation at the time.
3580,60,1,40,ISFJ,40,"<no>  Anxiety seems to be quite high. I have worries or worries about trivial things, but that seems to be my original personality."
3581,60,1,40,ISFJ,41,"<no> There is no objection to calling. If there's something I need to call, I'll do it, but I've never thought of avoiding it."
3582,60,1,40,ISFJ,42,<no>  It doesn't take that much time. I just thought it was a different opinion from mine and that's it. I don't bother trying to understand.
3583,60,1,40,ISFJ,43,<no>  I tend to meet them when they contact me. We do not contact you first to make an appointment or actively ask you to meet.
3584,60,1,40,ISFJ,44,"<no> If there is a setback in the plan, I tend to revise it again to suit the situation, but I do not try to follow the original plan."

3586,60,1,40,ISFJ,46,"<Yes>  Even if I think about it, I think it's useless because it's not a question that has an answer. I don't like philosophical questions."
3587,60,1,40,ISFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I do not know. Emotions can be controlled well, but depending on the situation, emotions can be swayed, and it seems to be different from time to time."
3588,60,1,40,ISFJ,48,"<neutrality>  It seems like you're either trying to save face or vice versa, blaming yourself for faults, or neither. It's just that the other person realizes and admits the wrong, and it doesn't seem like I have to do anything."
3601,61,0,40,ENTP,1,"<Yes> There are many things to learn from meeting various friends, and there are various experiences and things to gain."
3602,61,0,40,ENTP,2,<Yes>  The plan is to learn small pieces of furniture at a furniture workshop and later make all the pieces of furniture.
3603,61,0,40,ENTP,3,"<no>  If you don't empathize, don't cry. Empathy is not really good either. There are times when I cry and I don't want to see you anymore."
3604,61,0,40,ENTP,4,"<no>  There are some things I don¡¯t think will fail, and there is a greater sense of accomplishment if I improvise and complete them according to the situation."
3605,61,0,40,ENTP,5,"<Yes>  No matter what others say, I will go my own way. In any case, hardships and adversity are necessary for good results."
3606,61,0,40,ENTP,6,"<no>  I have to show my usual self in front of people I know, but it's fun to express myself in a new way in front of new people."

3610,61,0,40,ENTP,10,"<no>  A small mistake is an emotion that people try to take for granted, and I think it would be beneficial to invest that energy elsewhere."
3611,61,0,40,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  There is a routine that opens the door to conversation, such as forming a consensus, and I think interpersonal relationships are also a point of pride."
3612,61,0,40,ENTP,12,"<no>  Debate naturally arises because there are different interpretations of what you see, and the purpose is to convince you that what I am saying is right."
3613,61,0,40,ENTP,13,"<no>  The thing I hear the most from people around me is ¡°Think about it rationally.¡± It's not that their feelings are wrong, they just think they're different."
3614,61,0,40,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  If you plan, success and failure will surely happen, but if you improvise, you won't have any regrets."
3615,61,0,40,ENTP,15,"<Yes>  Because I am positive to myself in my own way, I think that others will not look bad on myself."

3618,61,0,40,ENTP,18,<no>  It's a style that doesn't see other people doing well. I think living with my good taste is the true life.
3619,61,0,40,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  There are many things I want to do compared to my abilities. When I see someone who is better at something than me, I hate being envious, so I think I want to do well too."
3620,61,0,40,ENTP,20,"<no> I'm not worried that things will go wrong, but rather I'm worried that my abilities won't be properly recognized because I can't produce results."

3623,61,0,40,ENTP,23,"<no> If everyone was rational, there would be no debate, and there would be no creativity. Because everyone has to be different to be number one."
3624,61,0,40,ENTP,24,<no>  It's because I think a true break is to completely rest without bothering things. Because I thought rest was first for now.
3625,61,0,40,ENTP,25,<Yes>  I think better opinions come out when we have opinions. It's fun to see who wins.

3630,61,0,40,ENTP,30,"<Yes>  Because it is a world in my imagination that I have never experienced, I can judge the world on my own, and I can decorate it as I please."
3631,61,0,40,ENTP,31,"<Yes>  It is sometimes fun to learn other people's values or abilities and reverse them, rather than being locked in a mold of one's own."
3632,61,0,40,ENTP,32,"<Yes>  It's not interesting to say that the theory I chose is correct, not my idea, just by choosing a side of theory A or theory B."
3633,61,0,40,ENTP,33,"<no>  I like to talk about myself, so I don't listen to what others say. So I don't have much empathy."

3640,61,0,40,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  I don't know if it's natural, but I think worrying is a waste of energy. It may have changed from an experience where things work better if you're positive."

3644,61,0,40,ENTP,44,"<no>  There is no such thing as a good plan, so there are not many setbacks. Even if I have it, if I think of something else, I tend to do it."
3645,61,0,40,ENTP,45,"<no>  Don't waste energy on anxiety, failure, and mistakes, think about what you're doing now, and what you're going to do in the future has a lot of weight, so you don't have many regrets."
3646,61,0,40,ENTP,46,<no>  It is also fun to let your imagination run wild. I think it's a suitable topic for curiosity.
3647,61,0,40,ENTP,47,"<Yes> Their rational judgment is weak, so they get angry when they are angry, and when they are happy, they are happy enough to be seen by others, which becomes a negative factor in their social life."
3648,61,0,40,ENTP,48,<no>  Admit what you did wrong and try to get an apology. I don't think I need to worry about the face of the other person.
3661,62,1,40,ESTP,1,"<no>  I have fun talking at gatherings, but I don't make friends because it's easy to break."
3662,62,1,40,ESTP,2,<Yes>  I am interested in the metaverse or the future in preparation for the 4th industrial revolution.
3663,62,1,40,ESTP,3,"<Yes>  Maybe it's because I'm older, but without knowing it, I sympathize with that person and feel the pain together."
3664,62,1,40,ESTP,4,"<neutrality>  Things don't always go as planned, but we can't prepare perfectly, and that doesn't mean we don't blindly prepare, we tend to prepare in the middle."
3665,62,1,40,ESTP,5,"<neutrality>  have confidence in myself, so when a high-pressure environment comes, I do not get buried and observe the situation for a while, but I do not maintain a perfect composure."
3666,62,1,40,ESTP,6,<no>  I tend to approach new people first. The reason is that I love talking about new ideas with new people.
3667,62,1,40,ESTP,7,<no>  It's because these days things happen before the project is finished and it's boring to do just one thing.
3668,62,1,40,ESTP,8,"<no>  When I watch movies or dramas, I tend to think logically, so I'm not sentimental."
3669,62,1,40,ESTP,9,"<no>  Because I like to spend my time freely and I like to improvise things, so when I have a plan and I feel like I have to do it, I feel pressured."
3670,62,1,40,ESTP,10,"<no>  I have trust in me, and everyone makes small mistakes, and they happen often, so I don't care too much."
3671,62,1,40,ESTP,11,"<Yes>  Most of the time, it's easy to approach and talk to people you're interested in. I tend to go first because I can learn new thoughts and facts."
3672,62,1,40,ESTP,12,<no>  I tend to like various interpretations of works of art or books. Because the opinions of people with different ideas from mine broaden my understanding.
3673,62,1,40,ESTP,13,"<Yes> People around me often say that I am logical and analytical, and when I follow my reason rather than my emotions, I feel less regret as a result, so I tend to follow reason."
3674,62,1,40,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  I like to do it when I think of something I want to improvise when it's not something I have to do. Because planning is burdensome, like homework."
3675,62,1,40,ESTP,15,"<Yes> Anyway, the perspective of seeing me is different. It's because I worry about what kind of person I will be seen by everyone, and even if I look good, later on, there is nothing that thinks of me as much as I did, and I am betrayed."
3676,62,1,40,ESTP,16,"<Yes>  I like to hang out with many people. These days, working together, such as volunteer groups or classes, can help each other, so I tend to enjoy participating in group activities."
3677,62,1,40,ESTP,17,"<Yes> Interpreting in my own way is because various endings can be achieved. It is said that the ending of the recent Hwanmarriage drama was beyond imagination, but the fun was doubled when I interpreted it in my own way."
3678,62,1,40,ESTP,18,"<no>  It's good to help others succeed, but if I don't succeed, I'll feel defeated and jealous of myself, and my success is more important to me."
3679,62,1,40,ESTP,19,"<Yes>  was curious about the future metaverse, I was curious about nft, I wanted to know how to use computer shortcuts, and I wanted to know too many things, so I felt it was difficult to decide in what order to do things first."
3680,62,1,40,ESTP,20,"<no>  I get angry when I do my best and the results aren¡¯t good, but I¡¯m the type to accept it, so I¡¯m not even worried."
3681,62,1,40,ESTP,21,"<no>  Someone has to do it, and if the job is given to me, I tend to do my best to lead it in a good direction. Because I think things have to go on."
3682,62,1,40,ESTP,22,"<neutrality>  Among artistic inclinations, I like to watch and listen to music and art, but I am not good at it. However, judging from the tendency to like original ideas or creative things and to pursue something different from others, it seems that there is a moderate level of artistic inclination."
3683,62,1,40,ESTP,23,"<Yes> This is because if reason is valued, it is thought that it will not cause major problems or crimes because almost robot-level results come out when making judgments on right and wrong."
3684,62,1,40,ESTP,24,"<no>  I don't think housework always finishes first. If I don¡¯t do it, I get votes, but even if I don¡¯t get too many votes, I think it¡¯s housework, so I tend to take a break first and do housework later."
3685,62,1,40,ESTP,25,<neutrality> It is because I feel alive in the way people have various thoughts and try to convince others of their thoughts and be recognized.
3686,62,1,40,ESTP,26,"<no>  It's because I like to be in the spotlight, and I feel like I'm being praised for living up to people's expectations, and I'm recognized for myself."
3687,62,1,40,ESTP,27,"<Yes> This is because when you get angry with your second-year-old son right away and the child says a cute emoticon or a soft word, your heart melts and your emotions change so quickly that you wonder when you got angry."
3688,62,1,40,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  I tend to think efficiently when I work, but I get angry when I see people who focus on emotions or force their own thoughts. For example, volunteering is efficient if each person is responsible for their part and division of labor is effective, but I got annoyed when I saw people who didn't understand."
3689,62,1,40,ESTP,29,"<Yes>  Recently, I had to do research on a program while studying, but I had an experience of pushing it until the deadline, and pushing it when the deadline approached."
3690,62,1,40,ESTP,30,"<Yes>  I think the question of the afterlife is interesting because if the deceased parents do not have an afterlife, it is too empty and there is no reason to hold ancestral rites, and people want to be rewarded after death for bad things and good things in life."
3691,62,1,40,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  I like the time we spend together rather than the time alone, but these days it seems to be in the middle. When there are a lot of people, there is a lot of noise and there are a lot of people who only express their opinions, so I think I'm in the middle these days."
3692,62,1,40,ESTP,32,"<Yes> Because life is real. This is because the theory-centeredness seems to float when looking at the application ability. I am interested in financial technology, but when I look at YouTube, I feel that time is wasted when I see a lot of theoretical, principled explanations rather than realistic ones."
3693,62,1,40,ESTP,33,"<neutrality>  When I see someone with a completely different environment from which I grew up, I can relate to the emotions and life of a person, but it is difficult to sympathize with people who buy luxury goods easily or spend money too easily."
3694,62,1,40,ESTP,34,"<no>  It's something I have to do anyway, and delaying the decision doesn't lead to good results, so I tend to make quick decisions and make decisions right away."
3695,62,1,40,ESTP,35,"<Yes>  Decisions already made take a lot of time and effort. That's why I can't waste that time and effort, so I tend to do my best for the decisions I've already made."
3696,62,1,40,ESTP,36,"<neutrality>  When I see a lot of people and they talk happily, I get excited and happy without knowing it, but these days, it's hard to adapt if it's too loud, so I chose neutral."
3697,62,1,40,ESTP,37,"<Yes>  Works of art and works of art have the intention of the artist, but there are no special restrictions on how the viewer interprets them, and no one criticizes them for interpreting them as they are seen."
3698,62,1,40,ESTP,38,"<no>  I like listening to people's stories and sharing opinions, so it's not hard to understand other people's feelings."
3699,62,1,40,ESTP,39,"<no>  Planning is like homework, so I blame myself if I don¡¯t do it, so I tend to do it spontaneously."
3700,62,1,40,ESTP,40,"<no> The natural inclination is not to feel anxious, but if you think about the future and old age today, prices are rising and it is difficult to find a job. These situations seem to create anxiety, especially in the political area."
3701,62,1,40,ESTP,41,"<no>  In the case of delivery via text or chat, there are cases in which immediate confirmation is not possible, and there are many urgent and urgent matters that need to be handled, but I think waiting is inefficient."
3702,62,1,40,ESTP,42,"<no>  I think the world is made up of me and other people. Because of that, I can understand it, but I think it wastes too much time and effort. I think it's much more efficient to find someone who agrees with me and work together."
3703,62,1,40,ESTP,43,"<Yes> Since we are friends, I tend to contact him first because I think I want to see him more and want to contact him rather than my ego."
3704,62,1,40,ESTP,44,"<no>  When things don't go as planned, I tend to move on to the next plan. I decided to go to a restaurant that was decided at the meeting, but it was closed, or when I saw that the plan was suddenly disrupted, I immediately looked for the next best solution."
3705,62,1,40,ESTP,45,"<no>  Mistakes are made by everyone, and regretting irreversible things that have already passed will not fix things again, so I tend to think about the future rather than regret the mistakes of a long time ago."
3706,62,1,40,ESTP,46,"<no>  tend to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. It's because I often think about why I live so hard and do my best, but when I know the reason for living and existing, I have faith and don't wander."
3707,62,1,40,ESTP,47,"<neutrality>  People around me say I'm logical, but as I get older, I can see that there are times when I'm a bit swayed by emotions. Since people live together, there are many times when I feel grateful when they sympathize with me and comfort me, so I don't rule out emotions too much and I think I'm neutral."
3708,62,1,40,ESTP,48,"<no>  If it is clear that it is the other person's fault, I tend to tell them clearly and let them recognize the fault. Because if you rush over to save face, you may make the same mistake the next time you do something."
3721,63,1,30,ENFP,1,"<Yes>  The reason is that I always like to have new experiences or study, so when I start something new, I belong to a new community and I make new friends regularly."
3722,63,1,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  These days, interest in web 3.0 has increased, so I am devoting time and effort to exploring metaverse creation. In particular, I became interested in ZEPETO and Roblox, so I am focusing on reading related to creation and Web 3.0."
3723,63,1,30,ENFP,3,"<Yes> Usually when someone else is crying, I seem to focus on why that person is crying. So, my experiences related to the reason tend to come to mind. I think there are many times when I want to cry when I empathize with the other person's feelings and recall my experience."
3724,63,1,30,ENFP,4,"<neutrality>  You start by thinking about the number of things that can go wrong, but you don't make perfect preparations. I tend to think about the number of cases in progress rather than a clear plan because there are many things that are spontaneous and the plan I just made can change in the next moment."
3725,63,1,30,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  I had a situation where my computer crashed right before an important project was due. I was taken aback, but I moved on to the next thing, calculating the time left and the time to solve the problem."
3726,63,1,30,ENFP,6,"<no> In order, I tend to introduce myself to new people after talking to people I already know. New people and experiences are important to me, but relationships with people I already know are more important, so in order, people I already know come first."
3727,63,1,30,ENFP,7,<no>  I am a person who arranges all sorts of projects at the same time to the extent that people around me call me AI or robot.
3728,63,1,30,ENFP,8,"<Yes> Even when I watch movies or dramas, I get so involved that I cry and laugh often. In particular, when I watch a book or drama, I tend to follow the emotional lines of the story and characters together as if I were one of the characters."
3729,63,1,30,ENFP,9,"<Yes>  When I think about making a plan, I often organize lists or schedules. Pretty diary, planner These days, I also like programs like Notion. But I'm not the type to stick to that plan."
3730,63,1,30,ENFP,10,"<no>  don't have a lot of doubts about myself, and if there are mistakes or errors, I focus on getting things going again."
3731,63,1,30,ENFP,11,"<no>  Reaching out to strangers is not difficult. However, in order to approach and have a conversation with someone I am interested in, I feel that my own emotions are greater than those of the other person, so I tend to talk a lot with the people around me."
3732,63,1,30,ENFP,12,"<neutrality>  I enjoy reading and watching discussions about different interpretations of art, but I'm not very interested in discussing them myself. The reason is that it is difficult for me to put my interpretations or feelings into words."
3733,63,1,30,ENFP,13,"<no>  tend to follow emotions rather than reason. Even when important events are ahead, they are often driven by emotions. There are more emotional evaluations than rational ones, such as ""He likes/happy when he does this""."
3734,63,1,30,ENFP,14,"<Yes>  First of all, I write down a list of my schedule for the day, but I like to do the things I want to do in the order I want to do, including both on-schedule and off-schedule tasks."
3735,63,1,30,ENFP,15,"<no>  tend to worry and worry a lot about what kind of person I will appear to others. Usually, I tend to make myself look the way I want to appear."
3736,63,1,30,ENFP,16,"<Yes>  We are actively participating in various group activities, and there are currently 18 group kakaotalk rooms that are actively communicating in each community."
3737,63,1,30,ENFP,17,"<neutrality>  Regardless of the ending, I love books and movies. When I read a book or a movie, I tend to focus on the flow rather than the ending."
3738,63,1,30,ENFP,18,"<Yes>  I am happy to see other people's success. My success is good, but it's good to feel that happiness together when I contribute to the success of others."
3739,63,1,30,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  I have tried to organize my interests through the mandala programming method. Even though I didn't fill in all the boxes, there was so much to do that even with a simple time allocation, 24 hours a day wasn't enough, so it was difficult to decide what to do next."
3740,63,1,30,ENFP,20,"<Yes>  I don't worry too much, but I always think about what's next for what I'm doing now. That's why I often worry about what might go wrong."
3741,63,1,30,ENFP,21,"<no>  Even now, various organizations are participating as executives, and there are also communities that are directly operated. In college, I was also the head of the department. I am full of energy when I am leading others."
3742,63,1,30,ENFP,22,"<no>  I'm not good at art, but I've been living in a theatrical company that I wanted to do for 3 years, and I've been playing the piano for 18 years since I was a very young child. I also love going to photo exhibitions and exhibitions. I especially like to watch movies related to art."
3743,63,1,30,ENFP,23,"<no> Even if reason is emphasized, emotion must be included in the delivery method. I think the very idea of changing the world for the better comes from emotions. Just as no one thinks an efficient world full of robots is a better world, the world always needs warmth and goofiness."
3744,63,1,30,ENFP,24,"<no>  There are times when I want to finish the housework first because I want to feel organized, but most of the time I tend to take a break first. Since I am doing something all day, rest is more important to me than housework."
3745,63,1,30,ENFP,25,<no>  Tired of arguing around you. It is better to intervene in the debate and suggest a way to resolve it.
3746,63,1,30,ENFP,26,"<no>  He has no intention of attracting attention, but he seems to stand out when he does what he wants to do."
3747,63,1,30,ENFP,27,"<Yes> My emotions come and go to the point where my lover says that I am very dynamic next to me. Emotions change quickly, so it is similar to the emotions of a child who is excited to play even after crying until just now."
3748,63,1,30,ENFP,28,"<neutrality>  Rather than being annoyed, I'm frustrated and try to solve it. Even when I was a nurse, if I couldn't get the order or direction of work, I tended to look at it for a while and then step forward and get the direction."
3749,63,1,30,ENFP,29,"<Yes>  do things in the order I want to do, so there are many things I do near deadlines. Even recently."
3750,63,1,30,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  I don't think there are many people who aren't interested in the afterlife. Since it is an area that no one knows about, it is attractive that you can let your imagination run wild. That's why I enjoyed reading Dante's 'Divine Comedy' while looking up the comments."
3751,63,1,30,ENFP,31,"<neutrality> If the things I want to do are things I want to do alone, I want to be alone, and if things have to be done with others, I want to spend time with others."
3752,63,1,30,ENFP,32,"<no>  I also like to carefully check and discuss theories. These days, I am studying hard in an economy-related community, and it is so fun and happy to discuss while discussing economic theories. If I had to focus on my field, I like discussions about economics and scientific theories."
3753,63,1,30,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  Everyone has a different background. There are many people who have the exact opposite experience as mine. In the past, I wasn¡¯t the type to sympathize as easily as I am now, but after living in a theater company for three years and worrying about people¡¯s backgrounds, emotions, and behaviors, I seem to be able to empathize easily these days."
3754,63,1,30,ENFP,34,<no>  I like to make decisions quickly and try things first. I tend to try anything first because I don¡¯t know if I don¡¯t experience it.
3755,63,1,30,ENFP,35,<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly and think about the direction and continuation while working. I believe that decisions about work can change at any time.
3756,63,1,30,ENFP,36,"<neutrality>  I like to relieve the fatigue of the week with fun parties and events, and I also like to have time alone. After Corona, it has become more common to have time alone these days."
3757,63,1,30,ENFP,37,"<Yes>  I like to appreciate works of art displayed in museums, photo exhibitions, galleries, exhibitions, etc., and also like to see works of art such as plays, movies, and musicals."
3758,63,1,30,ENFP,38,"<no>  It is not difficult for most people to understand other people's feelings. If you say it's a difficult situation to understand, it seems that it's difficult to understand only when you don't know the reason for your emotions."
3759,63,1,30,ENFP,39,"<Yes> First of all, I like to do the planning itself. But the implementation of the plan is another matter."
3760,63,1,30,ENFP,40,"<no>  Because of their innate tendency, they do not feel much anxiety, but there are many cases where anxiety often appears in the realm of intuition."
3761,63,1,30,ENFP,41,"<Yes>  Compared to spoken language, it seems more comfortable to communicate through text these days. In particular, as conversations by voice or video using ZOOM have become more frequent after the corona, the burden caused by phone calls is increasing."
3762,63,1,30,ENFP,42,"<neutrality>  If I have a different opinion about something that has nothing to do with me, I just skip it. However, when it comes to work or study, I spend a lot of time trying to understand other opinions."
3763,63,1,30,ENFP,43,<Yes>  I tend to live with the words ¡°When will we meet?¡± Planning a meeting with someone is fun.
3764,63,1,30,ENFP,44,"<Yes> The project didn't go the way I initially intended, so I recalculated the date and time and re-planned to get back to the planned schedule in a short time."
3765,63,1,30,ENFP,45,<Yes>  I tend to think a lot about making mistakes or feeling sorry for my friends and family.
3766,63,1,30,ENFP,46,"<no> When talking with a lover, a question we often ask each other is ""Why do we live?"" Also, the community I am currently participating in is making a lot of effort to find the meaning of life."
3767,63,1,30,ENFP,47,"<no>  Rather than being swayed by emotions, even if you make a decision based on your emotions, you think you make a reasonably reasonable decision to some extent. It seems that there are many evaluations that people around me are the ones who are affected by emotions a lot."
3768,63,1,30,ENFP,48,"<Yes>  Rather than directly pointing out the other person's faults and solving the immediate problem, I do not think that public criticism or criticism is important in the case of mistakes that the other party is already aware of. This is because it is important that problems do not arise again in the future, and that the other person who is to be sorry for the mistakes he already knows does not have to be hurt for any other reason than the fault."
3781,64,1,30,ESFP,1,"<no>  Before the corona period, I often had social gatherings or new meetings with friends, but after the corona period, I was reluctant to make new friends because I was anxious about corona."
3782,64,1,30,ESFP,2,"<no>  Because my interests are narrow, I am not interested in various fields. These days, I am interested in cooking, so I often watch cooking videos on YouTube."
3783,64,1,30,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  He seems to have excellent empathy, so when he sees someone else having a hard time or crying, he seems to receive the same emotions. I often cry even when I watch YouTube videos."
3784,64,1,30,ESFP,4,<no>  It sounds like you're not good at making plans. I tend to move flexibly depending on the situation at the time.
3785,64,1,30,ESFP,5,"<neutrality> Neutral because it is neither highly agitated nor stable. If you feel pressure when you are doing your work, it seems that the pressure to do it on time causes a lack of meticulousness."
3786,64,1,30,ESFP,6,"<no>  Rather than talking to people I already know, I prefer meeting new people, so I approach new people first, and I don't have any hesitation in introducing myself first."
3787,64,1,30,ESFP,7,"<Yes> I'm not good at multiplayer, so I think I can focus on one thing and focus on the next thing only when that thing is over. If I do two things at the same time, I can't concentrate on both."
3788,64,1,30,ESFP,8,"<Yes>  When you listen to dramas, variety shows, and songs, you seem to empathize more with the stories and lyrics than others."
3789,64,1,30,ESFP,9,<no>  It seems far from planning. I tend to think about what I need to do on a given day in my head and act on it.
3790,64,1,30,ESFP,10,"<neutrality>  don't doubt my abilities with small mistakes, but if they are repeated continuously, there are times when I think there is something wrong with my abilities."
3791,64,1,30,ESFP,11,"<Yes>  It's easy to start a friendly conversation by reaching out to people you're interested in or wanting to get close to first. In clubs or on blind dates, I tend to get closer by talking first."
3792,64,1,30,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  am not interested in works of art. As previously answered, the field of interest is narrow. That's why I don't seem to be interested in the interpretation of art works either."
3793,64,1,30,ESFP,13,"<no>  I tend to follow my emotions. I seem to be far from being rational, and I place greater value on how I feel than on my rational judgment in the situation."
3794,64,1,30,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  It's far from planned, so I spontaneously do what I want to do and what I have to do today."
3795,64,1,30,ESFP,15,"<no>  I rarely notice others. I don't really care what other people think of me. If you think, 'They're people you only see once, what', or if you're someone who needs to see them often, you think, 'Think like that' and don't pay much attention."
3796,64,1,30,ESFP,16,"<Yes>  get energy from building relationships with lots of people, new people. These days, I'm not going to all the meetings because of the corona, so my life is boring."
3797,64,1,30,ESFP,17,"<no>  I am not very interested in various interpretations of works of art, books and films. Even if I come to know various interpretations, I think it ends with 'That's right~'."
3798,64,1,30,ESFP,18,"<neutrality> It's good for me to be successful, and it's also good for me to play the role of a supporter helping others succeed. I don¡¯t have much greed for success, so even if I don¡¯t succeed, I like the role of helping others succeed."
3799,64,1,30,ESFP,19,"<no>  I have little interest. Cooking and health are all my interests, and even if I have those interests, I don't think I put them into action."
3800,64,1,30,ESFP,20,"<no>  You seem to have an optimistic personality. That's why I don't seem to worry about things going wrong, and I'm living my life with the mindset that things will work out somehow."
3801,64,1,30,ESFP,21,<no>  I want to take on the role of a leader because I like to control things and let things flow the way I want.
3802,64,1,30,ESFP,22,"<Yes>  I am not interested in art itself, and I am not interested in that field."
3803,64,1,30,ESFP,23,"<no>  believe that emotions are more valuable than reason. I had the experience of bumping into a lot of rational people, and I felt that it was difficult to communicate emotionally with that person. So I came to think that emotions are more valuable than reason."
3804,64,1,30,ESFP,24,"<Yes>  I feel a sense of responsibility because I think housework is something I must do. Because of my responsibilities, I have to finish my chores so I can relax and feel at ease."
3805,64,1,30,ESFP,25,"<no>  Controversy is seen as a confrontation of opinions, so it is frustrating to see different opinions clash. It would be fine if the conflicting opinions were compromised, but it is not fun to look at this as it seems that there are many cases where the differences of opinion do not narrow and lead to an ongoing debate rather than when conflicting opinions are compromised."
3806,64,1,30,ESFP,26,"<neutrality>  Because you want to interact with a lot of people and have a tendency to talk, there are times when you want attention from others. But I don't do anything to draw other people's attention."
3807,64,1,30,ESFP,27,"<neutrality> If there is an angry situation, it seems that the rate of anger does not go from 0 to 10 suddenly, but gradually changes from 0 to 3, 3 to 5, and 5 to 7. On the contrary, even in a happy situation after being depressed, it doesn't seem to suddenly become happy, and the emotions seem to change over a suitable period of time."
3808,64,1,30,ESFP,28,"<Yes>  I consider myself a very efficient person, especially when I study, I study efficiently. My boyfriend recently studied for a license, but I felt frustrated when I saw him studying inefficiently, and he gave me various advice."
3809,64,1,30,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  I think it's because it's not planned. There have been many times when I regretted procrastinating until the end, but these days, I'm working hard and improving little by little."
3810,64,1,30,ESFP,30,"<no>  I am not very interested in the world after death. It's already after I'm dead, so it's not me. It's not a world I'll experience, so I don't think it's a subject I'm interested in."
3811,64,1,30,ESFP,31,"<Yes>  Being alone is boring. I like to spend time with friends and family while chatting. These days, rather than friends, I often spend time with my mom and sister, going to restaurants and chatting."
3812,64,1,30,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  don't really like discussions because I think discussions are never-ending debates. Besides, being theory-centered means being rational, but since I don't put much value on rational things (I'm a person who puts more value on emotion), theory-centered discussions are far from my interests, and I think it's not a favorable field, but rather boring."
3813,64,1,30,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  It seems that it is easy to empathize with the stories of tolerable people. I can sympathize with people from different backgrounds on TV, and I can sympathize with the stories of friends who are walking a different path than me."
3814,64,1,30,ESFP,34,"<no>  Decisions and decisions seem to be made quickly and easily. Because of his direct and straight-forward personality, he makes decisions decisively and quickly."
3815,64,1,30,ESFP,35,"<Yes>  I've already made a decision because I'm confident in that decision. I don't have doubts about the decisions I'm sure of, but rather believe in them and go out."
3816,64,1,30,ESFP,36,"<no> Before the corona time, I went out to the club every weekend, but after corona, I finish the weekend by meeting close friends or taking a break alone."
3817,64,1,30,ESFP,37,"<no>  I don't enjoy going to art galleries, exhibitions, museums, etc. When I listen to the interpretation of a work of art, it ends with 'Oh, that's right~', and I'm not interested."
3818,64,1,30,ESFP,38,"<no>  I think I have excellent empathy, so I am good at empathizing with other people's feelings. When someone feels a difficult emotion, they immediately empathize with it."
3819,64,1,30,ESFP,39,"<no>  I tend to plan to some extent for work, but I rarely plan and do personal things. Act flexibly depending on the situation."
3820,64,1,30,ESFP,40,"<neutrality>  Originally, I didn't feel much anxiety in my personality, but recently, I seem to feel anxiety often due to the discord with my dad. I think the emotional impact of family is great."
3821,64,1,30,ESFP,41,"<no>  Feel free to make phone calls. I don't think it's hard work if you think that a phone call is, after all, a conversation with someone."
3822,64,1,30,ESFP,42,"<neutrality>  When I have a different opinion than mine, I try my best to understand why I think that way from that person's point of view. However, in the case of a completely opposite opinion, there are many cases where you have an antipathy to the opinion rather than trying to understand it."
3823,64,1,30,ESFP,43,"<Yes>  Most of my friends and I promise to meet up. Besides the promise to meet, I tend to contact you first."
3824,64,1,30,ESFP,44,"<neutrality>  When I'm working, I try to go back to the original plan as soon as possible if I get out of the situation I've planned, but when I'm traveling, I tend to change my plans flexibly if things go wrong."
3825,64,1,30,ESFP,45,"<neutrality>  I rarely regret what I did, but there is one mistake I regret. Since I was injured while exercising too much 3 years ago, my back has not gotten better, so I am regretting why I exercised too much at that time. It seems that even people who have no regrets will regret it because their body hurts."
3826,64,1,30,ESFP,46,"<no>  don't think I've ever thought about human existence and the reason for living. Humans live because they were born, and I think that it would be okay if we live happily until we die."
3827,64,1,30,ESFP,47,"<Yes>  Emotionally, I am sensitive to emotions such as anger, sadness, joy, and depression. So rather than thinking rationally, it seems that I am easily swayed by the emotions I feel at the time. My family also thinks I am emotionally sensitive."
3828,64,1,30,ESFP,48,"<no>  Since he has a knife-like personality, doing wrong is wrong, so you have to point out right and wrong about it. If this person's fault is obvious, you'll be angry, and it's hard to save face when you're angry."
3841,65,0,30,ENFP,1,<neutrality>  It is not easy to make one yourself because human relationships are too difficult to do on a regular basis.
3842,65,0,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes> Since I'm not in a professional job or tech, I'm still looking at future earnings. Interest is the economy."
3843,65,0,30,ENFP,3,<no>  I don't want to cry just because someone else is crying. why are you crying I think is more important.
3844,65,0,30,ENFP,4,"<Yes>  There are several countermeasures, but it is the tendency to prepare for the situation. Because you don't do anything you can't afford."
3845,65,0,30,ENFP,5,"<neutrality>  You may or may not be able to maintain it in a high-pressure environment. I felt it was not easy to remain neutral, especially in relationships with my family."
3846,65,0,30,ENFP,6,"<neutrality>  First of all, I like to talk to someone I know and get introduced. That way, I think I can give him some tips or reduce discomfort."
3847,65,0,30,ENFP,7,<no>  I don't think you have to do anything else after you're completely done. I think it can be done while adjusting to some extent at the same time.
3848,65,0,30,ENFP,8,<no>  I don't think it's very sentimental. I don't get emotional easily in any situation.
3849,65,0,30,ENFP,9,<neutrality>  I tend to set up the framework of the plan to some extent and work according to the situation at the time.
3850,65,0,30,ENFP,10,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. This is because mistakes can be made by others or circumstances, not by my ability."
3851,65,0,30,ENFP,11,"<no>  I tend to go to the person I'm interested in first and start a conversation, and I can't stand it if I'm curious. So I tend to go first."
3852,65,0,30,ENFP,12,"<no> When looking at art works, I tend to spend a lot of time looking at them, and it's good to go alone, but I think there are various perspectives, so I share opinions and learn about things I don't know."
3853,65,0,30,ENFP,13,"<Yes>  Judge rationally. When judged rationally, there were more right things. Even if I think about it, the evaluation around me is the same."
3854,65,0,30,ENFP,14,<no>  I like to work according to the situation of the day. It's not easy to do as planned.
3855,65,0,30,ENFP,15,<no> It doesn't matter who you look like. I think the most important thing is to think I'm right and not regret after doing that.
3856,65,0,30,ENFP,16,"<neutrality>  I enjoy group activities if it's something I like. These days, I can't force it because of Corona, but it's the same."
3857,65,0,30,ENFP,17,"<neutrality>  I think the act of interpreting in your own way can be dangerous if done wrong. The Inception movie, which everyone knows about but not recently, was fun."
3858,65,0,30,ENFP,18,"<neutrality>  To some extent, I feel satisfied. It's true that my success is better, but I don't think that's bad either if I'm a person who has helped others succeed."
3859,65,0,30,ENFP,19,"<no>  You may still have many interests, but you can choose your priorities for what to do next."
3860,65,0,30,ENFP,20,"<no> Because I think that things can go wrong, I think my ability is to deal with them moment by moment when a situation that seems to go wrong comes."
3861,65,0,30,ENFP,21,"<no>  Since I have been the leader of the group even when I was young, I have no intention of avoiding it, and I will not miss a good opportunity."
3862,65,0,30,ENFP,22,<neutrality>  I think it seems to be there in some parts. I've heard that it's not bad when painting oil paintings as a hobby.
3863,65,0,30,ENFP,23,<neutrality>  think it depends. I don't think there is a right answer to a better world.
3864,65,0,30,ENFP,24,"<neutrality>  It depends on how intense you want your break to be. If you need a break too much, you can put off household chores."
3865,65,0,30,ENFP,25,"<neutrality>  The quality of an argument depends on the criteria of the argument. If it's an argument with high-level conversations, I find it amusing, but I don't see it if it's not."
3866,65,0,30,ENFP,26,"<Yes>  really don't want to attract other people's attention. It seems to stand out even when it is still, so it is a part that I really strive for the rest of my life."
3867,65,0,30,ENFP,27,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it happens, and when it doesn't, there's little change. I think it depends."
3868,65,0,30,ENFP,28,"<Yes>  I am under a lot of stress. I work for the same money, but I get angry when I see someone else doing 3 while I knock out 1."
3869,65,0,30,ENFP,29,"<no> If you have to do something, do it with responsibility, so don't put it off."
3870,65,0,30,ENFP,30,"<no>  It is a world that no one has experienced and will never return to. Rather, I think it's a good story to dazzle others."
3871,65,0,30,ENFP,31,"<neutrality>  I need time to be alone and I like to spend time with other people, so I spend my time appropriately."
3872,65,0,30,ENFP,32,"<neutrality>  Theory is also important, and I think a principled story is also necessary. I think the point of view that all the knowledge of the past is boring and uninteresting is not very good. I think there are also some really useless ones."
3873,65,0,30,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  It's easy to relate to. It's just empathy, but I don't assimilate to that person, so I can empathize from the position of understanding the other person."
3874,65,0,30,ENFP,34,<Yes>  I think it's good to make a decision after thinking as much as possible under the premise that a decision is irreversible.
3875,65,0,30,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  I don't think you can change the decision you've already made, so I think it's right to respond to it."
3876,65,0,30,ENFP,36,"<neutrality> The way to relieve fatigue is different each time, but Ju, who has met a lot of people, has time alone, and if not, holds events such as fun parties."
3877,65,0,30,ENFP,37,"<Yes>  I think it expresses a different area that I hadn't thought of. So, if I have a chance and am interested, I'll go."
3878,65,0,30,ENFP,38,"<neutrality>  Understanding emotions is not an easy task in itself, so it takes time to fully listen to the story, and that time is the key."
3879,65,0,30,ENFP,39,"<neutrality> When there is no work, I do not plan at all. But I plan and execute things like what I have to do that day."
3880,65,0,30,ENFP,40,"<neutrality>  When I was younger, I often felt insecure during my adolescence, but at this age, I don¡¯t seem to be in a situation like that."
3881,65,0,30,ENFP,41,"<no>  I'm completely personal, but I don't find making calls difficult or tiring."
3882,65,0,30,ENFP,42,<Yes>  think you can understand purely when you think about why other people express different opinions the way they do.
3883,65,0,30,ENFP,43,<neutrality>  I don't think it's important that I contact you first and who gets in touch first.
3884,65,0,30,ENFP,44,<neutrality>  I think this also depends on the situation at the moment. Because it depends on what kind of plan you choose.
3885,65,0,30,ENFP,45,"<Yes> One day, when I suddenly think of that moment, so many emotions come out. So I try not to make old mistakes."
3886,65,0,30,ENFP,46,"<no>  Anyway, I think it exists now and the reason for life is that each individual thinks on their own."
3887,65,0,30,ENFP,47,"<no>  I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions. I often express and communicate my thoughts and feelings, so I control my emotions well."
3888,65,0,30,ENFP,48,"<neutrality> This is also different depending on the situation, so each moment is different. I shouldn't regret it later."
3901,66,1,40,ESFJ,1,<no>  I don't deliberately make new friends periodically. I already have a lot of friends and I think maintaining existing relationships is more important than making new friends.
3902,66,1,40,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  When I watch the news or look for information, I look in various directions. These days, I'm interested in things like side jobs that I can do at home. I'm looking for things related to data labeling or previewers. I have a lot of interest in dramas and movies, so I look for information or news about them, or search for things about children's education."
3903,66,1,40,ESFJ,3,"<neutrality>  It seems different from time to time. I think there are many cases where tears come out because of emotions about the situation rather than seeing other people crying. So in dramas, there are times when I don't cry when the main character is crying, but there are times when I get emotional when I hear a certain situation or line."
3904,66,1,40,ESFJ,4,"<neutrality> When things go wrong, I think that it could be like this next time, and maybe I can do it in other ways, but I'm not the type to carefully prepare various preparations."
3905,66,1,40,ESFJ,5,"<neutrality>  Recently, I haven't had anything to put a lot of pressure on, but judging from my past experience, I'm nervous and nervous before an exam or presentation, but I try not to show it well on the outside, and I don't think I was very nervous in practice."
3906,66,1,40,ESFJ,6,"<neutrality>  If there are people I know, I will greet and talk with people I know first, but if there are new people, I always take the time to introduce myself and talk with new people rather than just talking to people I already know. I think talking to someone new is exciting and uplifting."
3907,66,1,40,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  Even when labeling data, I tend to complete one project before moving on to another. When I watch a drama or movie, if there is a program I am watching, I start watching another movie after watching it."
3908,66,1,40,ESFJ,8,"<no> It may differ from time to time, but in general, it seems to be more realistic than sentimental. Even when I have sentimental thoughts, on the other hand, I always put money, time, and realistic results in mind first."
3909,66,1,40,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  When I receive a new calendar, I tend to write down the birthdays of family members and acquaintances and schedules I need to remember first and check them. Set an alarm on your phone or make a list of things you need to buy."
3910,66,1,40,ESFJ,10,"<no>  I check to see if I've done anything wrong, but I don't blame everything on myself. If there is a mistake, it is important to find out what went wrong and not make it again, so I tend to pass it over as if I could make it."
3911,66,1,40,ESFJ,11,"<Yes> It would be a little uncomfortable and not easy for someone whose position or awareness is very different from mine, but if you are in a similar position or your age, talking to and introducing yourself rarely seems to be difficult."
3912,66,1,40,ESFJ,12,"<neutrality>  I don't think I have a lot of knowledge about art works, so I've never interpreted or discussed them myself, but I like watching programs that experts discuss or articles with interpretations."
3913,66,1,40,ESFJ,13,"<Yes> When I think of the consequences that follow when something happens, I think I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. People around me tend to evaluate me as a rational and realistic person rather than emotional."
3914,66,1,40,ESFJ,14,"<no>  Even when I go out or meet friends, I rarely meet spontaneously. For my schedule or physical condition, I tend to think ahead and adjust things rather than unplanned events. I tend not to propose to the other person out of the blue because it seems like it could put a burden on the other person."
3915,66,1,40,ESFJ,15,"<neutrality>  I don't think I'm the type to worry and be conscious to show off my original tendencies to others. However, it seems that there are a lot of worries about whether or not you did something rude or made the other person feel bad."
3916,66,1,40,ESFJ,16,"<neutrality> There are few cases of group activities since corona. So these days, most of the gatherings are small groups of close friends. I've been knitting as a hobby for a while, but at the meeting I was active at that time, now I meet continuously even if I don't knit."
3917,66,1,40,ESFJ,17,"<Yes> The most recent work I watched with such an issue is the drama 'My Liberation Journal'. After the last episode, the ending was different from the usual works, so I went to the drama talk room to listen to opinions or look for posts where I wrote a review. It was interesting how different people interpreted it in different ways."
3918,66,1,40,ESFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I don't think I've ever thought about the satisfaction of helping someone else succeed. However, there is a sense of satisfaction that comes from trying to be a parent who can help a child grow well while raising a child."
3919,66,1,40,ESFJ,19,"<no>  Usually, even if you have a lot of interests, you weigh the weight of the work and prioritize it. It's the same when you do housework and when you do what you want to do."
3920,66,1,40,ESFJ,20,"<no>  Since I was young, I tend to think positively rather than worrying about things going wrong. It's not that I don't think about things going wrong, and I'm not the type to worry and fret in advance."
3921,66,1,40,ESFJ,21,"<Yes>  I like hanging out with my close friends and acquaintances, and I like meeting new people, but I tend not to step out as a leader because of the sense of responsibility and pressure."
3922,66,1,40,ESFJ,22,"<no>  Since I was little, I liked making things with my hands, and I like drawing, knitting, and sewing as my hobbies. It's not great, but I don't think it's artistically inclined."
3923,66,1,40,ESFJ,23,"<no>  Of course, reason is important, but I think it would be too barren to think of a world without emotions. I think it is better to harmonize everything rather than focusing on one or the other."
3924,66,1,40,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  If you see something to be done, such as cleaning, washing dishes, or doing the laundry, you have to finish it first so you can rest comfortably. Anyway, if it's something I have to do today, it's much more comfortable to finish work first and rest."
3925,66,1,40,ESFJ,25,"<Yes>  It's fun to see different opinions arguing, not forced, childish fights. I think I can broaden my thinking through various perspectives."
3926,66,1,40,ESFJ,26,"<neutrality>  Being the leader of the group or receiving special attention is burdensome, but seeing that you enjoy social media and try to communicate with people around you, I think you have a neutral side."
3927,66,1,40,ESFJ,27,"<no>  I don't think so. When something pleasant happens, I immediately rejoice, but when something unpleasant happens, I tend to think deeply about it."
3928,66,1,40,ESFJ,28,"<no>  If you're not efficient, you can teach me and wait for me, but I think it's more annoying if you're not sincere or have a bad attitude toward work."
3929,66,1,40,ESFJ,29,"<no>  Usually, when I have work to do, I tend to finish it first and then rest. Of course, when things don't go my way or I don't want to do it, I do it slowly, but it's rarely the case that I suddenly start at the end after putting it off."
3930,66,1,40,ESFJ,30,<Yes>  It's more interesting and fun that there is no right answer and I can't be sure if it's real because I can't experience it myself.
3931,66,1,40,ESFJ,31,"<neutrality>  When I met people often, there were times when I felt more bored when I was alone. However, as I spend more time alone after COVID-19, now I need time alone as much as I spend time with other people."
3932,66,1,40,ESFJ,32,<Yes> Discussions centered only on theory seem to feel stiff. I am not interested in the principled story because I think it is difficult to expand the thinking or add imagination.
3933,66,1,40,ESFJ,33,"<Yes>  If you think about your usual human relationships, it seems to be mostly like that. When I meet people, I think it's like that when I see that I'm meeting various people and maintaining friendships regardless of academic background, age, or region of origin."
3934,66,1,40,ESFJ,34,"<Yes> For example, when you buy something, you don't buy it right away after seeing it for the first time, you compare various things and make a decision at the end."
3935,66,1,40,ESFJ,35,"<Yes>  If I've already made a decision, I tend not to think again. This is because I tend to ponder and think a lot before making a decision, and if I have already made a decision, I believe that I should believe in it and do my best for the result."
3936,66,1,40,ESFJ,36,"<no>  I've been married for a long time and I'm raising children, so I tend to spend my weekends quietly with my family."
3937,66,1,40,ESFJ,37,"<neutrality>  I have a heart, but I don't go to museum exhibitions on purpose. However, whenever I go to a place, if there is an exhibition, I always look around."
3938,66,1,40,ESFJ,38,"<neutrality>  Usually, I try to understand other people's feelings, and even if my thoughts and feelings are different, I tend to understand that that person can have those feelings. However, there are often times when it is difficult for a person who does not work well to understand the closest husband and in-laws."
3939,66,1,40,ESFJ,39,"<Yes>  I usually think about what I will do tomorrow before going to bed. Even when I wake up in the morning, I seem to prioritize the things I have to do that day."
3940,66,1,40,ESFJ,40,<Yes>  It seems to be an innate tendency. This is because I have very few memories of feeling particularly anxious and anxious since I was young.
3941,66,1,40,ESFJ,41,<neutrality>  It seems to depend on who you are talking to. I don't feel it's difficult for me to make a phone call if I'm not burdened with it.
3942,66,1,40,ESFJ,42,"<neutrality>  I don't do that much with other people. Even if you have a different opinion from me, I think it can be because that person is a different person. However, I need a lot of time for my husband, who I have to share the most opinions with."
3943,66,1,40,ESFJ,43,"<Yes>  If I haven't been in touch for a while or if it's been longer than usual, I tend to contact him first and ask to meet him."
3944,66,1,40,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback in the plan, it seems that the mind is in a hurry. I went on an outing with my family a while ago, but when I suddenly went to an unplanned place in the middle, I rushed my schedule to go to the originally planned time."
3945,66,1,40,ESFJ,45,"<neutrality>  don't do it often, but sometimes there are times when I think about what happened in the past and wonder why. Maybe it's because I keep feeling sorry for myself for that mistake, or it's because I feel sorry for the other person."
3946,66,1,40,ESFJ,46,"<no>  I tend to think deeply about it and keep it in mind. Even when I read a book or a movie, I tend to think about it in relation to my life and occasionally reflect on my existence."
3947,66,1,40,ESFJ,47,"<neutrality>  try to control my emotions in any situation or in my relationships with other people, but it seems that there are many times when it is difficult to control my emotions when it comes to certain people (husband and in-laws). People around me seem to think so too."
3948,66,1,40,ESFJ,48,"<no>  It doesn't seem like that. I think if the other person is wrong, I tend to point it out and talk about it directly. That's why I sometimes hear it being straightforward."
3961,67,1,20,ENFP,1,"<Yes>  like to have new experiences. If you do, you will meet various people and make friends who are like you in the group. In the group, the person who fits the heart keeps in touch."
3962,67,1,20,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  These days, I'm interested in inner peace. I'm learning yoga and reading to calm my troubled mind because it's the end of the year."
3963,67,1,20,ENFP,3,"<Yes> I'm good at empathy. If someone else cries, you will cry along. I don't really feel anything, I'm the type to completely immerse myself in the situation."
3964,67,1,20,ENFP,4,"<neutrality>  If you can't do it vaguely, why don't you try something like that? I have only a few thoughts. Even if there are countermeasures, I don¡¯t follow them all, I tend to act according to the situation at the time."
3965,67,1,20,ENFP,5,"<no>  have no composure. If your boss is watching you from behind the paperwork you do every day in the office, you will become stuttering and flustered. Rather, I tend to perform well in relaxed situations."
3966,67,1,20,ENFP,6,"<neutrality>  At first, I talk to people I know, then find someone I like. If there is someone I want to get close to, I tend to approach them without hesitation and start talking to them. If it's an uncomfortable position, I tend to talk more with people I know."
3967,67,1,20,ENFP,7,"<no>  If I lose my concentration even though I am immersed in one thing, I start doing something else. I don't have a long concentration, so it's more efficient to do several things little by little."
3968,67,1,20,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  He has a happy-go-lucky personality. I completely immerse myself in the main character while reading a book or watching a movie. When they are happy, they are happy together, and when they are sad, they shed tears right away. The range of emotions is considerable."
3969,67,1,20,ENFP,9,"<Yes>  Making plans is always fun. But I'm not the type to get stressed out if I can't get all my plans done. I just enjoy the act of making plans. Depending on my mood, I sometimes write in my diary and sometimes I use a mobile phone app."
3970,67,1,20,ENFP,10,"<Yes>  tend to blame myself a lot for small mistakes. For example, if I make a mistake while working on a document at work, I still feel resentful and clueless for making mistakes. I get up quickly, but when I make a mistake, I tend to endlessly blame myself."
3971,67,1,20,ENFP,11,"<Yes> Most people prefer to talk first. I try to have a conversation to find common ground with that person. The process is not difficult and enjoyable. Once, while traveling abroad, I found a Korean sitting alone. When I noticed a gap, I immediately went and talked to him. When we chatted, we had a lot in common because we were the same age. 4 years later, we are still friends."
3972,67,1,20,ENFP,12,"<no>  love having conversations about impressive works. I also enjoy looking up interpretations on YouTube, writing down my feelings alone, and having conversations with friends. When I share my personal point of view, it's fun to come up with unexpected interpretations. I think even the process is part of appreciating the work."
3973,67,1,20,ENFP,13,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on the situation. In the situation I am in, I tend to try to be rational. Conversely, I tend to empathize with the other person¡¯s situation. If you want a solution after enough sympathy, I tend to find it together at that time. So people around me seem to feel that I am 100% emotional."
3974,67,1,20,ENFP,14,"<neutrality> Plan only the essentials and spend the rest of your time free. For example, if I have to clean my room, I do it quickly and leave the next schedule to improvise. If I want to eat, I eat, and if I want to go out suddenly, I go out. I don't plan everything in detail."
3975,67,1,20,ENFP,15,"<neutrality>  tend to try not to worry. In my early twenties, there was a time when I tried to look good to everyone. I pretend to be brighter and I can't even say no. After graduating, I went through a period of sorting out my personal relationships, and I felt more at ease. There are people who like it as it is without packaging, so I'm not as afraid as I used to be. I'm still in the process of growing, so I have some worries, but I'm putting them down a lot."
3976,67,1,20,ENFP,16,"<no>  I don't like large group activities. Especially these days, it's comfortable to be with a few like-minded people."
3977,67,1,20,ENFP,17,<Yes>  i love you. Director Park Chan-wook's recent <Decision to Break Up>
3978,67,1,20,ENFP,18,"<no>  I feel more satisfied when I am successful. Other people's success is not mine in the end. I can be proud, but I think the size of my satisfaction will be greater from my success."
3979,67,1,20,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  There are too many interests. Yoga, tufting, space-related YouTube, blogging challenges, diary decorating, travel, job change, etc. are just too many to list. Sometimes I do all of this in one day. Even ten bodies are not enough."
3980,67,1,20,ENFP,20,"<Yes>  There are so many useless worries. I don't have a reason, I think it's a tendency. I was timid when I was young. When I think about it now, I think it was because at that time everything was full of beginners. I'm pretty much better now, but I still tend to worry when I start a new job."
3981,67,1,20,ENFP,21,"<Yes> Leaders are burdened. Rather than being a leader, I prefer being a secretary or a mood maker. Leaders get criticized this way and that way. I am vulnerable to criticism, so I want to have fun with as many people as possible."
3982,67,1,20,ENFP,22,"<no> From an early age, when I looked at aptitude tests or Saju, it came out that I had excellent artistic inclinations. I also agree. As a small case, I was in charge of making PT throughout my college life. I received a lot of compliments on the result and it led to good grades. I love making and decorating, and I feel proud when I hear compliments on the results."
3983,67,1,20,ENFP,23,"<no> It could be a rational world if rationality was emphasized, but I don't think it would be a better world. I am a person who thinks kindness wins everything. Wouldn't it be a dominant society if only rationality was valued? I think it will be a world where the weak are still weak and only the strong hold power."
3984,67,1,20,ENFP,24,"<neutrality> If I have energy left, I unconditionally finish the chores first. If it's hard to lift a hand, take a break first. However, after recovering to a certain extent, I start doing housework right away. Rest should be done in a completely relaxed state that is not stressed, but a messy house is stressful. I try to get my housework done first."
3985,67,1,20,ENFP,25,"<neutrality>  It's fun to watch the debate itself, but I feel tired when I raise my voice or only assert myself."
3986,67,1,20,ENFP,26,"<no> I've been in a dance club since I was in elementary school. Doesn't this fact alone seem like someone who likes to be in the spotlight? Excessive attention is burdensome, but I love the momentary cheers and interest."
3987,67,1,20,ENFP,27,"<Yes>  tend to feel emotions intensely and quickly dissipate them. For example, if you encounter the truth while working, you will be stressed out by others. If I don't shake off my unpleasant feelings right away when my mood suddenly deteriorates, I open a notepad and pour out my unpleasant feelings like a person on the day of a big problem. Then the stress tends to go away quickly. I think the reason why I can continue to work in the service industry is because I have big emotional changes. Because the stress right now doesn't go over to a sense of skepticism about the job. Even if you're in a bad mood, if you have a little joy, you'll feel better right away."
3988,67,1,20,ENFP,28,"<Yes>  One of my colleagues is inflexible. Once you've learned the things in the A-B-C order, you do them in the A-B-C order until the end. Sometimes I-da-ga is fast. Every time that happens, I feel impatient and frustrated. Service workers need to respond appropriately to the situation, but responding according to the manual unconditionally is annoying."
3989,67,1,20,ENFP,29,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone things I am not confident in until later. You can tell just by looking at the fact that he has been putting off taking the computer literacy test for three months. I just have to finish the practice, but I'm putting it off because I'm afraid."
3990,67,1,20,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  Questions about the unknown are always interesting. Because you don't know, you can unfold various imaginations. movie ""Coco"""
3991,67,1,20,ENFP,31,"<Yes>  These days, I want to spend time with other people. Just two months ago, I needed a break by myself. I stayed at home for a month or two, and now I want to go out soon."
3992,67,1,20,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  In principled stories, there are often cases where there is no substance. You can feel it especially when you look at the debate of the candidates during the election season. There are a lot of discussions that end after listening to the original answer, but I thought it was very boring and exhausting."
3993,67,1,20,ENFP,33,"<no>  If they are completely different, it seems that it will be difficult to fully sympathize even if interest arises. If there is a person born and raised in the United States in front of me, a native of Korea, how can I sympathize with everything? When they had prom parties, I would have been a student sitting on a hard chair and eating palms. I don't think I'll be able to sympathize with the interest and immersion in the world I don't know."
3994,67,1,20,ENFP,34,"<neutrality>  Depends on the weight of the crystal. I tend to make everyday decisions right away, but if they are directly related to my career or life, I postpone them as much as possible. I tend to think over and over again before making decisions."
3995,67,1,20,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to have many regrets. I live thinking that the decision at that time would have been the best. Even if I go back, I don't have the confidence to make a better ending."
3996,67,1,20,ENFP,36,<neutrality>  I tend to relieve the fatigue of the week by meeting up with friends. But you also need some alone time after meeting. It seems that this is due to weak physical strength.
3997,67,1,20,ENFP,37,<Yes>  I feel a sense of tranquility when I look at a work without thinking in an art gallery. I like it because it feels like the breadth of understanding expands when I hear the artist's intention after fully feeling my feelings about the work.
3998,67,1,20,ENFP,38,"<no>  Emotional assimilation is severe. In particular, he is good at immersing himself in the injustices others have experienced. There are many times when I get more angry or shed tears than the other person."
3999,67,1,20,ENFP,39,"<Yes>  like to take a big frame that is not detailed. For example, if you have to eat nutritional supplements, do banking, or wash blankets, it doesn't matter what time of day you do them. I enjoy making plans, but I only use them to the extent that I don't forget them."
4000,67,1,20,ENFP,40,"<no>  Anxiety is my friend. That's the innate tendency. When I was younger, I was anxious that I wouldn't be able to fit in with my friends, and now I'm worried that I'll fall behind alone. I think there is progress because there is that anxiety. In order not to fall behind, we use anxiety to gain momentum."
4001,67,1,20,ENFP,41,"<no>  I don't know why making phone calls is difficult. Isn't it easier than face-to-face? It's not particularly difficult. If you have friends in need, you are willing to help them."
4002,67,1,20,ENFP,42,"<Yes>  enjoy discussing with people. I took debating classes as a liberal arts college, and in high school, I created a debating club as my own club. I like it because the act of listening to and thinking about stories that are different from mine seems to expand the spectrum of thoughts."
4003,67,1,20,ENFP,43,"<Yes>  Contact your friend first. I think I have to express my liking, so if I miss you, I tend to contact you right away."
4004,67,1,20,ENFP,44,"<no>  If there is a problem with the plan, I tend to look for other alternatives. I recently planned to surf and camp, but it suddenly rained on the day. I immediately gave up camping and changed to a water park. There was a lot of regret about camping, but because I had to find the best of the moment, I found an alternative and was very satisfied with the result. If there is no good reason to go back, I tend to look for the best."
4005,67,1,20,ENFP,45,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to regret it, but I have regrets because of the corona. I gave up trying to apply for an overseas employment program, but corona occurred after the program ended. I thought there would be another opportunity, but I regret that a forced vacancy was created."
4006,67,1,20,ENFP,46,"<no>  I often think about the reason for human existence and life. Apart from scientific theories, we often wonder how the first humans were created and why they were born. No one is born because he wants to be born. Since I was born, I constantly create reasons to live, but then I often think about where to focus on to solidify my foundation."
4007,67,1,20,ENFP,47,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different depending on the situation. When I work, I have to hide my emotions and provide services, so I tend to control it as much as possible, but I usually let things flow. Happy things are more enjoyable Sad things are left alone until you use all your emotions. Because of this, it seems that the evaluation at work and among friends is different."
4008,67,1,20,ENFP,48,"<Yes> It is evident when working. Even if it's the other person's fault, you should provide a solution in a way that doesn't offend them as much as possible. Even when dealing with people like an occupational disease, I try to save face as much as possible."
4021,68,1,40,ISTP,1,"<no>  Making new friends comes with a lot of stress for me. The reason is that if you are not used to it, anxiety and tension increase."
4022,68,1,40,ISTP,2,<no>  I spend a lot of my free time with my dog. That's why I have a lot of interest in companion dogs.
4023,68,1,40,ISTP,3,"<Yes>  When I see someone else crying, I cry without even realizing it. I think it's more like that now that I'm in my 40s. There are many times when I feel anxious that maybe it will become my job."
4024,68,1,40,ISTP,4,"<no>  I'm not meticulous, so I find it very difficult to make preparations. I've made some preparations in the past, but they haven't helped much."
4025,68,1,40,ISTP,5,"<no>  I have a hard time maintaining my composure in a high-pressure environment. Recently, while participating as an inspector at Crowdworks, I felt a lot of pressure and my heart was pounding a lot because I was afraid I would make a mistake."
4026,68,1,40,ISTP,6,<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I know almost at parties and events. The reason is that it is comfortable and feels secure.
4027,68,1,40,ISTP,7,"<no>  When I'm working on one project and there's another project, I tend to do it together. The reason is that I get bored with doing just one thing."
4028,68,1,40,ISTP,8,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. I tend to be very sentimental when it comes to things that are related to me, and I think I've done less when it's not."
4029,68,1,40,ISTP,9,"<no> Even if I make a plan, it is difficult to put it into practice. It is also a burden to learn how to use electronic tools. I just tend to improvise."
4030,68,1,40,ISTP,10,<Yes>  I am timid. So I doubt a lot whether small mistakes are caused by my incompetence.
4031,68,1,40,ISTP,11,"<no>  From my experience, I don't think most of them started the conversation first. The reason was that it seemed to cause discomfort and burden to the other person."
4032,68,1,40,ISTP,12,"<Yes>  I don't like the debate itself. In particular, I am not very interested in esoteric works of art because they do not seem to have much relevance to my life."
4033,68,1,40,ISTP,13,<no>  I tend to follow emotions rather than reason. My husband also told me that I am an emotional person and that I should not let go of the opposite sex.
4034,68,1,40,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  don't think it's very meaningful to plan a schedule for the day. The reason is because of the plan. So, depending on the situation of the day, I tend to improvise."
4035,68,1,40,ISTP,15,<Yes>  I tend to value the opinions of others. I think the reason is lack of confidence.
4036,68,1,40,ISTP,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy participating in group activities at all. The reason is that I get tired easily. After Corona, there are more things to stay at home and outside activities are more out of interest."
4037,68,1,40,ISTP,17,"<no>  I prefer books and movies with a fixed ending. The reason is that the open ending leaves something to be desired, and I have to think for myself, so my head is complicated. I don't have any particular favorites lately."
4038,68,1,40,ISTP,18,<no>  I'm not really interested in helping others succeed. The reason is that my success is more important.
4039,68,1,40,ISTP,19,"<no>  don't have many interests. Recently, I've only developed an interest in health and companion dogs."
4040,68,1,40,ISTP,20,<Yes>  I am often worried that things might go wrong. I think the reason is lack of confidence.
4041,68,1,40,ISTP,21,"<Yes>  I hate being in the spotlight. Also, the responsibility that comes with the role of a leader feels overwhelming."
4042,68,1,40,ISTP,22,"<Yes>  have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that even if you encounter things with artistic value, you are not very inspired. When choosing clothes, I tend to focus on practicality rather than artistry, so I tend to wear a lot of black."
4043,68,1,40,ISTP,23,<no>  I think a world that values rationality rather than emotion would be cold and desolate. I think the world will be warm only when relationships between humans are made with emotions.
4044,68,1,40,ISTP,24,<no>  I prioritize rest over housework. The reason is because my body is more precious.
4045,68,1,40,ISTP,25,<no>  I don't like arguing itself. Watching other people's arguments doesn't interest me much.
4046,68,1,40,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  I try not to attract other people's attention. While walking on the street, I tend to avoid places with many people, and I prefer to seek out more secluded places."
4047,68,1,40,ISTP,27,"<Yes> My emotions change very quickly. For example, I get easily annoyed and angry when I'm hungry, but I feel better as soon as I get over it."
4048,68,1,40,ISTP,28,"<Yes>  I am an inefficient person. So there are a lot of mistakes. When I see an ineffective partner, I get annoyed because I feel like they're looking at me."
4049,68,1,40,ISTP,29,<Yes>  I am very lazy. I often put off washing the dishes for dinner until the next day because I was too lazy to do it.
4050,68,1,40,ISTP,30,<Yes>  think the question of the afterlife is interesting. The reason is because it is a world that has not been experienced and there is no right answer.
4051,68,1,40,ISTP,31,"<no>  I love spending time alone. These days, reading the newspaper alone at home is a lot of fun."
4052,68,1,40,ISTP,32,"<Yes>  When I see discussions that I am not interested in, I feel bored and bored. For example, I watch TV and change the channel as soon as a discussion program comes on."
4053,68,1,40,ISTP,33,"<no>  I don't easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds. The reason is that empathy for others is an interactive process in which appropriate relationships are formed, but such a process is not easy for me."
4054,68,1,40,ISTP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to change my mind often before making a decision. So I put it off until I'm sure, and I don't make a decision until the deadline is imminent."
4055,68,1,40,ISTP,35,<Yes>  I don't reconsider decisions I've already made. The reason is that the decision has already been made and nothing will change if you think about it again.
4056,68,1,40,ISTP,36,<no>  I tend to relieve fatigue by spending time alone. The reason is that parties and events give another fatigue.
4057,68,1,40,ISTP,37,"<no> When I go to an art museum, I tend to fall asleep. The same goes for other art works. The reason is because I don't know much about the field."
4058,68,1,40,ISTP,38,<no>  I tend to understand other people's feelings. The reason is that I have to do that so that others can understand my feelings.
4059,68,1,40,ISTP,39,<no>  I like a simple life. Plans are rarely followed by action.
4060,68,1,40,ISTP,40,"<no>  feel a lot of insecurity. The reason is because I feel that I am lacking a lot, such as health and economic power."
4061,68,1,40,ISTP,41,<Yes>  I want to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that it is difficult to know what to say.
4062,68,1,40,ISTP,42,"<no>  I admit to having differences of opinion, but I don't spend a lot of time trying to understand them. The reason is that even if I try to understand, the other person's thoughts do not change. We just acknowledge the diversity of each person."
4063,68,1,40,ISTP,43,<no>  I don't contact my friends to meet up first. The reason is because there is no reason to meet and time is a waste.
4064,68,1,40,ISTP,44,"<no>  I tend to give up right away when things go wrong with my plans. I recently made a diet plan, but I just gave up right away because I couldn't control my diet."
4065,68,1,40,ISTP,45,<Yes>  often regret my past mistakes. The reason is because I think my life is not happy now because of past mistakes.
4066,68,1,40,ISTP,46,<Yes>  I don't think deeply. The reason is because it is so difficult and complicated to think about human existence and the reason for living.
4067,68,1,40,ISTP,47,"<no>  I tend to try to control my emotions as much as possible. The reason is that if I am swayed by my emotions, it will be difficult for me and others."
4068,68,1,40,ISTP,48,"<Yes>  Even when the other person's fault is obvious, I try to save the other person's face. The reason is because I don't want to hurt the other person twice."
4081,69,0,40,ENTJ,1,<Yes>  Enjoy a new environment through overseas employment and volunteer activities. The reason is because challenges are the vitality of life.
4082,69,0,40,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  Recently, he is interested in IT technology, music, oriental philosophy, and international development cooperation, and thinks that language skills are essential."
4083,69,0,40,ENTJ,3,"<neutrality>  I understand your feelings, but I think empathy is a bit lacking. The reason is that other people's emotions are about a fragment."
4084,69,0,40,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  Because life can't always go the way you want it to. The second, third, and contrast are essential."
4085,69,0,40,ENTJ,5,"<Yes> Wasting emotions doesn't do you any good. This is because when you take on an intense job, you are the one who has to deal with it in the end, and the help of others is not a solution."
4086,69,0,40,ENTJ,6,"<neutrality>  There is nothing awkward about introducing me or having a conversation with an acquaintance. Because in human relationships, the conversation partner is important."
4087,69,0,40,ENTJ,7,"<Yes> Planning and completing projects sequentially is more efficient in terms of concentration and management. I am concentrating on office work, but when other additional work is promoted, most of them politely decline or adjust."
4088,69,0,40,ENTJ,8,"<no>  I try to judge rationally. When there is a mutual dispute, rational solutions and methods are much more likely to be the best."
4089,69,0,40,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  Individual memory is sometimes unreliable, so it is carefully recorded and reminded through Windows scheduler and tablet PC."
4090,69,0,40,ENTJ,10,"<no>  Mistakes can happen in any situation, and I think it can be a rather good opportunity to look back at me."
4091,69,0,40,ENTJ,11,"<neutrality>  It's not easy, but I mustered up the courage to have a conversation, and I've put my feelings down right away when the other person refuses or expresses dislike."
4092,69,0,40,ENTJ,12,"<no>  Going to an exhibition to see, critique, and hear from others is far more valuable than reading a book or two."
4093,69,0,40,ENTJ,13,<Yes>  Reason is because it derives results close to rational problem solving. The evaluations around me are quite satisfactory and supportive.
4094,69,0,40,ENTJ,14,"<neutrality>  I go ahead with what I planned, and when an impromptu situation that might be an opportunity comes, I often take active actions. I don't think there was usually anything to regret."
4095,69,0,40,ENTJ,15,"<no> There is no reason to look good to others, and there is no room for that. Life is too short to know your inner self."
4096,69,0,40,ENTJ,16,<Yes>  Doing work alone is not enough in terms of performance and satisfaction. Counseling and advice from the International Cooperation Volunteer Corps are vital to life.
4097,69,0,40,ENTJ,17,<Yes>  I also think of it as my own original interpretation rather than the author's obvious story result. The work is for the wife of Thomas Hardy.
4098,69,0,40,ENTJ,18,"<Yes>  In the end, there are many cases where helping others succeed is left as one's own growth. Success comes back to me like a boomerang."
4099,69,0,40,ENTJ,19,"<Yes>  It seems that there are so many interesting and happy topics in the world, such as reading literature, ODA (International Development Cooperation) forums, and English tests."
4100,69,0,40,ENTJ,20,"<no>  Work challenges are always inherent in success and failure, like the two sides of a coin, so worrying is just a useless waste."
4101,69,0,40,ENTJ,21,"<no>  It is a desperate opportunity to show one's experience and ability to many, and it can be the basis for success."
4102,69,0,40,ENTJ,22,"<no>  While reading and understanding literary and artistic works, I sometimes derive results in my own way. It is thought that human beings with sensibility have artistic inclinations."

4104,69,0,40,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  It's because you have to finish the housework first, and you can beat the laziness that may be later."
4105,69,0,40,ENTJ,25,"<neutrality>  It's not just fun. However, debate is a rational decision-making process for each other."

4110,69,0,40,ENTJ,30,<Yes> This is because the unknown world stretches our imagination to infinity. The existence of such a world can be an ideal for dreaming of a new world.
4111,69,0,40,ENTJ,31,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation, but seeing it with others is the vitality of life. It seems that there is a tendency to be alone because the social atmosphere of being careful about each other is prevalent in the corona city."
4112,69,0,40,ENTJ,32,"<no> Understanding the fundamental content becomes a judgment only when there is a root in the original theory. In discussions, presenting opinions without knowing the context only fuels conflict."

4120,69,0,40,ENTJ,40,"<no>  If you don't feel anxious, you may be a rather anxious person. Emotion without end accepts me as an expression of artistic life."
4121,69,0,40,ENTJ,41,<no>  It is necessary to communicate with each other and is a tool for expressing opinions. Contact is the foundation of human relationships and is always something to be concerned about.
4122,69,0,40,ENTJ,42,<no>  Fighting feelings against each other is just a waste of time. Aim to make it as simple and clear as possible. There may be disagreements in discussions.
4123,69,0,40,ENTJ,43,"<Yes>  This is because if I have a good feeling and contact you first, the other person responds well."
4124,69,0,40,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  If I didn't get a good score on the test, it was helpful to rearrange my study method and plan again."

4126,69,0,40,ENTJ,46,"<no>  The fundamental reason for human existence is the material that has no choice but to go together until death. It's always something I'm interested in, and it gives me a reason to live gratefully every day."
4127,69,0,40,ENTJ,47,"<no> As long as the expression of emotion is concise and sincere, the other person understands most of it."
4128,69,0,40,ENTJ,48,<no>  We need to rationally and quickly judge each other's right and wrong and conclude concisely. You don't have to make an effort.

4142,70,1,40,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  These days, I have a lot of thoughts about me after retirement, so I'm interested in preparing for retirement or investing accordingly."
4143,70,1,40,ENTP,3,<neutrality>  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. I think it depends on how my emotions are in that situation.
4144,70,1,40,ENTP,4,<no>  I tend to work with confidence and seek countermeasures if the result is not the case.
4145,70,1,40,ENTP,5,"<Yes>  It seems to me that the more pressure there is, the more it helps me to keep my composure."
4146,70,1,40,ENTP,6,"<no> With people I know, I can meet again later, so I prefer to get to know new people by talking more."
4147,70,1,40,ENTP,7,"<no>  It would be nice if I could completely shut down and do other things, but I don't think it's bad to take a break if there's a blockage in the process. I think it might be possible to increase efficiency by doing other things together."
4148,70,1,40,ENTP,8,<Yes>  I often hear that my emotions run wild. There are also things that are well synchronized with the surrounding situation.
4149,70,1,40,ENTP,9,"<no>  Basically, I don't like things that are framed. Even if you plan it anyway, it doesn't always go as planned."

4151,70,1,40,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  I don't find it difficult to approach people first or start a conversation. Moreover, wouldn't it be more active if someone was interested?"

4153,70,1,40,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to make rational decisions rather than emotional ones, so people around me are cold. I tend to be evaluated as being assertive."
4154,70,1,40,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  I tried to make a schedule under the plan, but in the end I did what I wanted to do at that moment. Planning doesn't mean anything to me."
4155,70,1,40,ENTP,15,"<no>  It may be because I don't pay much attention to others, but I don't care or worry about other people's opinions or evaluations."
4156,70,1,40,ENTP,16,"<neutrality>  I like things that a lot of people do together, but it depends on the type of group activity. It seems to be especially so these days."
4157,70,1,40,ENTP,17,"<Yes> It's good that other people and I think of different endings and find out the parts I didn't think of while talking about those thoughts. It's not a recent work, but I have memories of sharing various stories with many people through Gokseong."
4158,70,1,40,ENTP,18,"<neutrality>  Other people's success is good, but should I only have my own success? I think I'll be more satisfied if I succeed and help them."
4159,70,1,40,ENTP,19,"<neutrality>  I have a lot of interests, but I don't seem to have a situation where I don't know what to do because I set my priorities."
4160,70,1,40,ENTP,20,<no>  I don't worry in advance about a situation that doesn't come out. It is efficient to focus on work so that good results can come out in the time to worry.
4161,70,1,40,ENTP,21,"<Yes>  I like hanging out with a lot of people, but being in the lead is a bit burdensome."

4165,70,1,40,ENTP,25,<Yes>  I like to hear people's thoughts. A bloody argument sounds like a lot of fun.
4166,70,1,40,ENTP,26,"<neutrality>  It's too different depending on the situation. Depending on my condition that day, I want to be the main character, but I also want to be the shadow."
4167,70,1,40,ENTP,27,"<Yes>  I hear a lot that my emotions run wild, and I think so too. Up until now, I was angry all the way to the top of my head, but I also enjoyed it quickly."

4169,70,1,40,ENTP,29,"<neutrality>  It seems to be slightly different depending on the seriousness of the work. Even if you postpone it, if it can be done in time, it is often delayed."
4170,70,1,40,ENTP,30,"<neutrality>  It varies from time to time. It's interesting, but I don't believe in the afterlife, so I think it's a meaningless topic."
4171,70,1,40,ENTP,31,"<neutrality>  It¡¯s true that energy comes from being with a group rather than being alone, but these days, I spend time alone involuntarily, so this doesn¡¯t seem too bad either."

4173,70,1,40,ENTP,33,"<no>  I don't know how much it is possible, but it seems that complete empathy is difficult. It's not easy to empathize while pretending to know things I don't know."
4174,70,1,40,ENTP,34,"<no>  Even if you think about it, it's one of them anyway. I tend to keep my worries short and enjoy the time."
4175,70,1,40,ENTP,35,"<no>  If you've already made a decision, don't think about it again until you come to a conclusion. It's nothing to overturn, but it's a waste to care about it."
4176,70,1,40,ENTP,36,"<neutrality>  On weekends, there were times when I was always meeting with friends or attending gatherings to relieve stress, but these days, it's nice to spend time alone quietly."
4177,70,1,40,ENTP,37,"<Yes>  I like places like art galleries, exhibitions, and photo exhibitions. It just feels like healing."
4178,70,1,40,ENTP,38,<Yes>  It's hard to sympathize with people who blame others for their own faults or say that their work life is difficult and they don't quit.
4179,70,1,40,ENTP,39,"<no>  I wanted to plan and work, so even if I made a plan, it didn't go as planned. Everything is like that."
4180,70,1,40,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  I don't know if it's natural, but I don't feel anxious without reason. Of course, if you do something wrong, you feel insecure. Other than that, there seems to be very little."
4181,70,1,40,ENTP,41,"<Yes>  It's good to meet people, but talking on the phone is a bit... I feel like I can't convey the meaning I want to convey well over the phone."
4182,70,1,40,ENTP,42,<no>  I don't think it's necessary to understand that opinions differ. I tend to acknowledge and accept differences.
4183,70,1,40,ENTP,43,"<no>  We don't really contact each other first, but it seems like we get to see each other often because opportunities arise."
4184,70,1,40,ENTP,44,<no>  Not everything goes bankrupt if things don't go according to plan. I tend to show improvisation in the situation.
4185,70,1,40,ENTP,45,"<neutrality> I¡¯m not the type to look back on the past, but as I spend more time alone these days, there are moments of regret that sometimes come to mind."
4186,70,1,40,ENTP,46,<no>  I think it's a pointless worry. I'm not usually the type to think and think too deeply.
4187,70,1,40,ENTP,47,<no>  I think I'm relatively good at controlling my emotions. The evaluation of the people around me is generally the same.

4201,71,1,30,ESFJ,1,"<neutrality>  I love making new friends, but I don't try to force them. Making new friends is new and fun, but there is nothing more comfortable than existing friends, so I pursue making friends naturally when the opportunity arises."
4202,71,1,30,ESFJ,2,"<no>  My interests aren't very diverse, so I don't spend time exploring them. Recently, while taking a walk with a friend, he told me the origin of each food, and it was so interesting that I became interested in finding out the origin of the food."
4203,71,1,30,ESFJ,3,"<Yes> When I see another person crying, I empathize with them, and I often shed tears. If you know the situation or situation of the other person, you will be sad or depressed together."
4204,71,1,30,ESFJ,4,"<Yes>  Work may not go the way I thought, so I tend to think of the next best thing.

4205,71,1,30,ESFJ,5,"<no>  If you are under a lot of pressure, you will not be able to maintain your composure. When I feel pressured during a presentation or interview, I get very nervous, my head goes blank, and my heart races."
4206,71,1,30,ESFJ,6,"<neutrality>  I tend to talk to someone I already know, then naturally approach the new person with my group and say hello or introduce myself. I tend to spend some time getting to know people before approaching them."
4207,71,1,30,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  It feels comfortable and safe to start another project only after finishing one. When you handle various things together, mistakes can come out and each project has a part where the schedule can be delayed."
4208,71,1,30,ESFJ,8,"<neutrality> Sentimental, but not overly sentimental. Depending on the situation, there are times when it is sentimental and there are times when it is not."
4209,71,1,30,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  I like to make plans. I don't use a diary, but when I go on a trip, I plan my itinerary in advance, and I tend to make appointments for meetings with acquaintances on a monthly calendar in advance."
4210,71,1,30,ESFJ,10,"<no> Anyone can make a mistake, and I do not doubt my ability or knowledge, whether it is a big mistake or a small one. This is because the mistakes made by others can be my fault and it depends on the situation."
4211,71,1,30,ESFJ,11,"<Yes> It's not difficult to approach and have a conversation unless the other person thinks of you as unlikable. It can be a friend or a member of the opposite sex, and if you're interested, you want to know as much as you want and have a conversation. Most of the time, it was fun and interesting to get to know people who are interested in talking to them."
4212,71,1,30,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in art works, so I just appreciate them and do not discuss or interpret them in various ways."
4213,71,1,30,ESFJ,13,"<no> It seems that I tend to follow emotions rather than reason. There are many times when you act emotionally, and it is not easy to break up, and there are many times when you hear that the evaluation of the people around you is not rational."
4214,71,1,30,ESFJ,14,"<no>  Sometimes it's impromptu, but most of the time I have a schedule for the day. Deciding what to do for the day makes me feel at ease."
4215,71,1,30,ESFJ,15,"<Yes>  am not currently concerned. When I was young, I used to act conscious of other people's eyes, but as I got older, I felt it was no longer necessary. It's comfortable and nice to do what I want to do without anyone being conscious or noticing."
4216,71,1,30,ESFJ,16,"<no>  I like gatherings, but I don't enjoy participating in group activities. I don't necessarily want to participate in group activities, but if there is an opportunity, I will participate."

4218,71,1,30,ESFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I think my success is important, and I think helping others succeed is also important. Although it is important for me to succeed, it is not that great, and I feel a sense of accomplishment when I help others succeed, so the satisfaction is similar."

4220,71,1,30,ESFJ,20,"<Yes>  If things go wrong, I worry a lot because it could be twisted or go wrong in the future. So, in case of work, I have a habit of handling it meticulously and checking it one more time."
4221,71,1,30,ESFJ,21,"<Yes>  Assuming a leadership role increases the responsibility and feels too much pressure, so I try to avoid it as much as possible."
4222,71,1,30,ESFJ,22,"<neutrality>  I don't think I have any artistic inclination because I don't come up with outstanding or great ideas by doing anything, but people around me say I have an artistic side."
4223,71,1,30,ESFJ,23,"<neutrality> It is a position that thinks that both emotions and reason are important. If you focus too much on one part, I think there will definitely be a negative part corresponding to it. So I don't think it would have made the world a better place even if it had given importance to reason."
4224,71,1,30,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  Before taking a break I usually take a break after finishing all my chores or cleaning up. If there is something left to do, I can't rest comfortably because I have to take care of it someday."
4225,71,1,30,ESFJ,25,<Yes> It's interesting because I can hear other people's thoughts on the debate and judge it objectively because I'm not included.

4228,71,1,30,ESFJ,28,"<no>  It may be frustrating, but it doesn't annoy me if you're not as efficient as I am. I think the other person will give you advice because you can think that you are doing it efficiently."
4229,71,1,30,ESFJ,29,<no>  I don't procrastinate because I like to plan things. I tend to get things done rather quickly.
4230,71,1,30,ESFJ,30,"<Yes>  It is a realistically impossible part that has not been experienced directly, so stories about the afterlife are curious and interesting."

4232,71,1,30,ESFJ,32,<Yes>  Theory-oriented discussions or principled stories are not interesting. I think the part that you feel while actually experiencing and acting is more important.
4233,71,1,30,ESFJ,33,"<Yes>  If the background is different, there may be some differences between you and the other person, but you can easily sympathize because you may be the same in your thoughts."
4234,71,1,30,ESFJ,34,"<Yes> We do not make decisions easily. Decisions are important, so I don't make hasty judgments, and I make decisions after thinking carefully until the end."
4235,71,1,30,ESFJ,35,"<Yes>  There are times when I regret it, but I don't give it a second thought because it's a decision I've already made and it's irreversible."
4236,71,1,30,ESFJ,36,"<Yes> Spending time alone makes me feel less fun, less time consuming, and more sluggish. Spending time with many people and having fun every day gives vitality to life and relieves fatigue."
4237,71,1,30,ESFJ,37,"<Yes>  Even if I have a lot of interest in art works or I don't know much about them, I like the part of appreciating art works, paintings, and photos, and I like the unique atmosphere of art galleries and exhibitions."
4238,71,1,30,ESFJ,38,"<no>  Unless it's really nonsensical, I try to understand a lot about other people's situations and emotions, and slowly understand the parts I don't understand. When a co-worker is having a hard time or getting angry with his boss, he listens well and tries to understand how the other person is feeling."
4239,71,1,30,ESFJ,39,"<Yes>  have to plan what I have to do every day, so I don't miss anything, and I feel like it flows sequentially."

4242,71,1,30,ESFJ,42,"<no>  don't spend much time trying to understand other opinions. I respect and try to understand other opinions as well. I don't necessarily want to conform to my opinion. There was a time when I was talking about a problem with a former friend and we had a disagreement, but we didn't have a big fight because we tried to understand the other person's opinion."
4243,71,1,30,ESFJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact you to meet you first. Whether it's a friend I see often or a friend I haven't been in contact with in a long time, if I want to meet, I'll contact them first and make an appointment."
4244,71,1,30,ESFJ,44,"<no> When things go wrong, they don't try to get back to the plan because they always create a plan B as a workaround, albeit complicated. As I thought, not everything fits perfectly, so I don't bother going back under stress. If you go to restaurant A, eat, and try to go in time for the start of the movie, but if restaurant A is closed, you will visit restaurant B, which you have already found with plan B, and so on."
4245,71,1,30,ESFJ,45,"<no> Even if I often regret my recent mistakes, I don't bother to recall the mistakes of a long time ago and regret them. It is comforting to think that what has already passed is in the past."
4246,71,1,30,ESFJ,46,<Yes>  I don't think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. I don't want to complicate my life to the point where I still think about existence or why I live.
4247,71,1,30,ESFJ,47,<no> I'm not the type to be swayed by emotions. I always try to control my emotions because I think it's worse to make mistakes because I can't control my emotions. The evaluations around me always say that I am calm and control my emotions well.
4248,71,1,30,ESFJ,48,"<no>  If you made a mistake, I think the other person should know what you did wrong. Wrong is wrong and you don't bother trying to save face."
4261,72,1,20,ESFP,1,"<no>  In the past, I liked making new friends, but now I don¡¯t want to waste my emotions, so I only meet close friends often. If a situation where I have to make new friends is unavoidable, I don't like the awkward atmosphere, so I tend to go first."
4262,72,1,20,ESFP,2,"<neutrality> When I find an interest by chance, I focus on one thing from then on. These days, I have a lot of interest in musicals, so I watch a lot of videos and go to see them often with friends."
4263,72,1,20,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  If someone else is crying in a drama or movie, I cry too. I can fully feel the person's sadness, and I feel sad too."
4264,72,1,20,ESFP,4,"<Yes>  Things don¡¯t always go the way I want, so I tend to think ahead in case things don¡¯t go right."
4265,72,1,20,ESFP,5,"<no>  It may be different for each situation, but when the pressure is severe, I get a lot of stress. Recently, there were a lot of things I had to do within the given period at the company, and of course I did everything, but I was in a hurry, so it was stressful and difficult."
4266,72,1,20,ESFP,6,"<neutrality> If you already know a lot of people, you will hang out with them. If I don't know anyone, I think I'll go up and say hello to someone new. If I'm alone at an event or party, I'll feel depressed and tired, so if no one knows, I'll make friends."
4267,72,1,20,ESFP,7,"<neutrality>  If it's a project I choose, I'll start after I've completed one of them. This is because if you start doing several things at once, you may make mistakes. I was confused once before, so I went through the process at the same time and changed the contents."
4268,72,1,20,ESFP,8,"<Yes>  I think it's very sentimental because I always relate to the emotions of the characters when I watch a movie or read a book. Even when I look at the weather every day, I feel different moods."
4269,72,1,20,ESFP,9,"<no>  I don't like it. But when I have a lot of things to do, I make lists or jot down notes on my phone to remember to do them."
4270,72,1,20,ESFP,10,"<Yes> Recently, the company posted information in the wrong chat room. At that time, I felt very stupid and pathetic."
4271,72,1,20,ESFP,11,"<Yes>  If I have a crush on someone, I approach them first, ask them what they like, what their hobbies or interests are, and try to get to know them."
4272,72,1,20,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  I think the interpretation is different because each person has a different idea. So even if there is a different interpretation than mine, I'm not curious about it, and I tend to pass it off as if it could be."
4273,72,1,20,ESFP,13,"<no>  It's very emotional. I make decisions based on my emotions, so I regret a lot later. People around me seem to think that I am an improvisational person."
4274,72,1,20,ESFP,14,"<neutrality>  I plan my schedule for the day first, and if I suddenly want to do something in the middle, I tend to improvise or add it."
4275,72,1,20,ESFP,15,<no>  worry a lot. I'm the type to always look at other people's expressions or reactions in case my words or actions make others uncomfortable.
4276,72,1,20,ESFP,16,"<neutrality>  I enjoy group activities with people I am close to, but I don't want to do it with people I don't know. These days, I often meet up with close friends."
4277,72,1,20,ESFP,17,"<no>  It's good to have a conclusion. When I think about the various endings, I am really curious about what would have happened in reality. I wish someone could just tell me the answer."
4278,72,1,20,ESFP,18,<Yes>  I think I'll just be happy if I can help others succeed. It makes me happy because it reminds me of the face of the person who will be happy with the result rather than the result of that person's success.
4279,72,1,20,ESFP,19,"<no>  I don't have a lot of interests. When I like one thing, I like it deeply, but later I get tired of it, so I tend to find another interest."
4280,72,1,20,ESFP,20,<no>  I try to think that things will go well. But I tend to think about what to do in case something goes wrong.
4281,72,1,20,ESFP,21,"<Yes>  I want to avoid it, but I've done it a few times because of my personality. Because each person has a different opinion, I can't make everyone happy as a leader, so I want to avoid it as much as possible."
4282,72,1,20,ESFP,22,"<no>  am not good at art, but I like poetry and music, so I think I have some artistic inclination."
4283,72,1,20,ESFP,23,"<no>  If you judge rationally, you will make wise decisions, but people have emotions. Sometimes, I think emotions are more important."
4284,72,1,20,ESFP,24,"<Yes>  If I take a break without finishing my housework, I keep thinking about the housework I have to do while taking a break, so it's better to do it all and rest."
4285,72,1,20,ESFP,25,<no> Looking at the controversy makes me uncomfortable. I think it will be solved if someone just guesses.
4286,72,1,20,ESFP,26,"<no>  I usually talk first because I want to have an emotional connection with someone in the same room. Looking at this aspect, I think I'm on the side of trying to get attention."
4287,72,1,20,ESFP,27,"<neutrality>  It depends. For example, I feel good, but when someone suddenly talks about hitting candles, I feel bad."
4288,72,1,20,ESFP,28,<Yes>  co-worker does. It's frustrating to see someone taking longer to do something that could be done faster.
4289,72,1,20,ESFP,29,"<no>  If you put off what you have to do, you will keep thinking about it until you do it, and you will get stressed out. I feel comfortable doing what I have to do first."
4290,72,1,20,ESFP,30,"<Yes>  Everyone has death, so I wonder what will happen when I die. I think I'm more curious because I don't know when I'll die and there's no right answer for how I'll die."
4291,72,1,20,ESFP,31,"<neutrality>  When I spend a lot of time alone, I want to spend time with others, and when I spend too much time with others, I feel that I need time alone. These days, I tend to meet friends occasionally and enjoy some alone time."
4292,72,1,20,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  I don't have experience, but it's boring because I think it can't be proven based on theory. While I liked experimental science, I found theory-based science classes boring."
4293,72,1,20,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  Even if it's a different person than me, I think it might be like that when I share my thoughts or experiences. Of course, if you don't tell the person what he thinks, it will be difficult to sympathize with him."
4294,72,1,20,ESFP,34,"<no>  I have a quick temper, so I tend to make decisions quickly. That's why it's frustrating to see people who don't make decisions quickly."
4295,72,1,20,ESFP,35,<no>  sometimes wonder if I was wrong about the decisions I made. Could I have made a better decision? is this the best? I sometimes have this thought.
4296,72,1,20,ESFP,36,<Yes>  Time goes slow when you spend time alone. I think having a good time with friends and chatting helps relieve stress. I always see my friends often.
4297,72,1,20,ESFP,37,"<neutrality> Rather than art, these days I often watch musicals. Art doesn't move, so I'm not interested in it. I am more interested in seeing people's colorful expressions."
4298,72,1,20,ESFP,38,"<no>  I think I understand people's feelings very well. Considering the given environment, I would like to be able to do that."
4299,72,1,20,ESFP,39,"<Yes>  I don't care too much about personal things, but when it comes to work, I tend to decide what to do in order."
4300,72,1,20,ESFP,40,<no>  feel insecure sometimes. I'm afraid that the person I love won't love me as much as I love them. I guess it's an innate tendency.
4301,72,1,20,ESFP,41,"<no>  I don't avoid phone calls. If you like someone, you can talk for a long time."
4302,72,1,20,ESFP,42,"<Yes>  If I don't act the way I think, why the hell would I? Think about it. If you think about various reasons by yourself and think you can do that, I understand, but if you don't, it's frustrating."
4303,72,1,20,ESFP,43,<Yes>  I feel sad when the person I like doesn't contact me. I think I usually contact them first and meet them.
4304,72,1,20,ESFP,44,"<no>  If the plan is unavoidably disrupted, I try to find a new way. Anyway, I tend to think of doing it in a different way. When I recently went on a trip, the planned schedule was disrupted, so I made a new itinerary and moved."
4305,72,1,20,ESFP,45,"<no>  I think about the mistakes I made today, but I don't bother thinking about things from a long time ago. Because it's the past anyway and there's nothing I can do about it."
4306,72,1,20,ESFP,46,<no>  Where did humans come from and why do they exist? I tend to think about various theories. Why do I live? How can I live better? I worry before going to bed.
4307,72,1,20,ESFP,47,"<Yes>  When it's hard to control my emotions, it's hard for me to handle myself. I'm trying to make sure that doesn't happen. I haven't seen many people around me yet be swayed by emotions. At times like that, I tend to be alone."
4308,72,1,20,ESFP,48,"<Yes>  When I see the other person feeling guilty, I feel sorry too. So please comfort me that it might be."
4321,73,1,20,ESFP,1,"<neutrality> Depending on the situation, I get to know new people and make friends if they fit well, but if I don't have new acquaintances, I don't bother looking for them."
4322,73,1,20,ESFP,2,"<Yes>  If I have free time, I tend to focus on my interests as much as possible, and these days I am so interested in clothing that I search for various styles."
4323,73,1,20,ESFP,3,<Yes>  Watching a situation where someone else is crying or a video of someone crying makes me so sad and emotional. I think I want everyone to be happy.
4324,73,1,20,ESFP,4,"<no>  First of all, there is no countermeasure because you work without thinking that things are wrong. So when things go wrong, I always regret it."
4325,73,1,20,ESFP,5,"<no>  I find it difficult to maintain my composure in such situations. It's a style where anxiety is evident, and it's not recently, but when I go to interviews, I feel a lot of anxiety."
4326,73,1,20,ESFP,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk first with people I know. The reason is that people you know are more comfortable, so your mind is stable. However, if a new person comes to talk to you, you can easily talk and become friendly."
4327,73,1,20,ESFP,7,"<no>  I'm not good at concentrating, so I tend to go back and forth, and I can't focus on one thing. Even when I was in school, I had an experience of not being able to complete one task and starting another."
4328,73,1,20,ESFP,8,"<Yes>  Even when I watch a movie, when there is a sad scene, I empathize with it and it is very difficult."
4329,73,1,20,ESFP,9,"<no>  don't plan If you buy a diary every year, you can't always get past the first page."
4330,73,1,20,ESFP,10,"<Yes>  He has a style of worrying greatly about small mistakes, and although he has not had such experience recently, he blamed himself and felt incompetent after making mistakes while working in the past."
4331,73,1,20,ESFP,11,"<neutrality>  It's hard to talk to someone you're interested in, but try to approach them first through others or through other means."
4332,73,1,20,ESFP,12,"<no>  I'm not particularly interested. I don't have enough artistic knowledge to discuss works of art, and that field is a bit boring."
4333,73,1,20,ESFP,13,"<neutrality> Sometimes emotions take precedence, and sometimes reason takes precedence. However, in the past, there was a time when the other person was disappointed because he did not sympathize and focused only on what was the problem."
4334,73,1,20,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  I'm too tired from planning my day's schedule, and I prefer to improvise what I want to do. And there are more experiences where I went to a restaurant spontaneously and found it to be more delicious than the one I went to after looking for and planning it."
4335,73,1,20,ESFP,15,"<Yes> In the past, I worried a lot, but these days, other people instilled that they weren't that interested in me, so I think that's changed."
4336,73,1,20,ESFP,16,"<neutrality>  I don't know because I don't participate in group activities. But if I ever get to participate in a group activity, I really want to participate."
4337,73,1,20,ESFP,17,"<no>  I don't like open endings. The reason is that when it ends like that, I feel uncomfortable and I feel refreshed when I see the complete ending with my own eyes."
4338,73,1,20,ESFP,18,"<no>  am a person who puts my own success first, so I don't think there's anything more satisfying than helping someone else succeed."
4339,73,1,20,ESFP,19,<no>  This kind of situation does not occur because it is a style that focuses on one interest rather than multiple interests.
4340,73,1,20,ESFP,20,"<neutrality>  First of all, I tend to worry that things will go wrong if I am not confident, but I am not the type to worry that everything will go wrong."
4341,73,1,20,ESFP,21,"<Yes>  want to avoid it as much as possible. The reason is that I don't have any responsibility or leadership as a leader, so it's better to become a team member and just do my part well."
4342,73,1,20,ESFP,22,"<Yes>  I have not been dexterous with my hands since I was young, and the other day I went to a one-day class, but I remember how difficult it was to combine colors."
4343,73,1,20,ESFP,23,"<neutrality> Of course, it could have been a better world if people valued rationality over emotions, but I think it is very necessary to worry about each other and grow together, and a world that only values rationality would be very depressing. Of course, emphasizing only emotions cannot make the world a better place, so both seem to be necessary."
4344,73,1,20,ESFP,24,"<no>  When you do housework, you cannot relax. I want to take a break right now, but I feel like I won't get enough rest if I do housework."
4345,73,1,20,ESFP,25,"<no>  don't like that situation. The reason is that just looking at the situation not only makes me feel bad, but it is also very uncomfortable."
4346,73,1,20,ESFP,26,"<neutrality>  I don't like stepping out in every situation, and I don't like to draw attention to myself, but if I'm too indifferent to me, I feel very bad."
4347,73,1,20,ESFP,27,"<Yes>  Emotional ups and downs are a bit severe. For example, I get angry for a moment and regret it right away, and I'm worried that the other person has been hurt."
4348,73,1,20,ESFP,28,"<Yes>  It's good to be efficient and finish work quickly, but if the other person doesn't do that, I get annoyed inside."
4349,73,1,20,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the last thing I have to do. Recently, I had to clean the house, but I put it off for 4 days."
4350,73,1,20,ESFP,30,"<Yes>  Interesting. The reason is that I wish there would be an afterlife, so conversations in that field are fun and interesting."
4351,73,1,20,ESFP,31,"<Yes>  I want to spend time with someone else these days. When I come home, I have a lot of empty feelings, so I want to spend time with other people as much as possible outside."
4352,73,1,20,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  One of my uncles likes to talk and has discussions centered on theory, but the seat is too boring and difficult and I want to avoid it."
4353,73,1,20,ESFP,33,"<no>  If the environment you've lived in from the beginning and the background is different, you won't be able to easily sympathize with the person's story. I think I'm more attracted to people who are similar to me and I think I'll communicate well with them."
4354,73,1,20,ESFP,34,"<Yes>  I keep changing my mind even before I make a decision, and I tend to procrastinate and procrastinate."
4355,73,1,20,ESFP,35,"<no>  kept thinking about the decision I had already made, regretting it, and changing it again. I try to avoid making decisions as much as possible."
4356,73,1,20,ESFP,36,"<Yes>  It's more fun to hang out with people rather than alone time, and it relieves fatigue."
4357,73,1,20,ESFP,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. I like active things, so I'm not the type to prefer going somewhere and quietly appreciating things."
4358,73,1,20,ESFP,38,"<no>  Easily empathize with other people's feelings. When a friend calls or cries about something sad, I become immersed in the situation and cry together."
4359,73,1,20,ESFP,39,"<neutrality>  I don't like planning, but I tend to write things down in advance that I have to do or don't want to forget."
4360,73,1,20,ESFP,40,"<no>  I tend to feel insecure. It seems to be a natural tendency, and I tend to worry a lot about everything."
4361,73,1,20,ESFP,41,<no>  I like to talk on the phone. I don't want to avoid making calls because I enjoy talking to them.
4362,73,1,20,ESFP,42,"<neutrality>  I strongly appeal my opinion when there is a problem due to a difference of opinion during a conversation with the other person, but if the other person also strongly appeals, a situation arises that will lead to a fight, so they just do not talk to each other. That's why I answer neutrally."
4363,73,1,20,ESFP,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to ask to meet first. It's more comfortable for me to adapt to others, so when a friend asks to meet, I usually meet him then."
4364,73,1,20,ESFP,44,"<no>  I'm not the type to make plans, so there's no such situation, and if there was, I think I would have made another plan without making any effort."
4365,73,1,20,ESFP,45,"<Yes>  regret a lot. Recently, I regretted being angry with my parents."
4366,73,1,20,ESFP,46,"<neutrality>  I don't think deeply, but there are times when I suddenly think about human existence and life. However, if I go too deep, I feel a little depressed, so I don't think deeply."
4367,73,1,20,ESFP,47,"<Yes>  tend to be swayed by emotions. Usually, if you feel too unfair, you have to talk about the unfortunate situation, but you are the type of person who gets so emotional that tears come first. People around me say that there are some emotional ups and downs."
4368,73,1,20,ESFP,48,"<Yes>  I'm kind of like that. I don't want to make the other person an enemy, and the other person will be regretful on the inside, so I will help you as much as possible in that situation."
4381,74,1,30,ISTP,1,"<no>  Rather than making new friends, I have little contact with my old friends. It's awkward even if we meet or contact each other after a long time."
4382,74,1,30,ISTP,2,"<Yes>  I have a lot of interests and a lot of hobbies. These are mostly things you can do at home. Recently, I am interested in videos and images such as Photoshop, illustration, and motion graphics, so I am studying on my own."
4383,74,1,30,ISTP,3,"<neutrality>  I don't feel like crying when lovers break up, but there are times when I want to cry when it comes to children or parents."
4384,74,1,30,ISTP,4,"<no>  It's not to the extent of planning things in detail, but I set a simple order to a certain extent and then, if things go wrong, I either make a decision at that time or postpone it until the next time."
4385,74,1,30,ISTP,5,<no>  It is difficult to maintain composure because I have little experience of being exposed to a high-pressure environment. I am very nervous and my hands are shaking. There are times when I don't even think about anything.
4386,74,1,30,ISTP,6,"<neutrality>  It's nice to meet someone I know and I feel familiar, but I don't talk to them first. It's just a greeting."
4387,74,1,30,ISTP,7,"<no>  If there are more than two projects, I tend to go back and forth from one task to another at the beginning, then compare the two projects later, work on the one with the least amount of free time first, and then work on the project with the most free time."
4388,74,1,30,ISTP,8,"<neutrality>  I'm not sure if I'm sentimental. The reason is that it depends on the situation. When I see scenery like natural scenery, I think it's beautiful, but when I look at things or objects, I only care about practicality and price."
4389,74,1,30,ISTP,9,"<no>  I'm not the type of person who likes to make plans, but I often forget what I need to do, so I enjoy using my phone's memo and calendar."
4390,74,1,30,ISTP,10,"<Yes>  I made a small mistake while making a self-taught video, and at that time, I had an experience of belittling my abilities."
4391,74,1,30,ISTP,11,<no>  It's difficult to strike up a conversation with someone you're interested in. It's because there were often times when we were talking and the conversation was interrupted because we couldn't remember a word or sentence.
4392,74,1,30,ISTP,12,"<neutrality> Various interpretations of works of art are often seen when thinking of inspiration or creativity, but they are not of interest enough to be discussed."
4393,74,1,30,ISTP,13,"<neutrality>  When it comes to my family, I think I tend to follow my emotions first, and when it comes to work, I tend to follow my reason, but people around me say that I mostly follow my emotions."
4394,74,1,30,ISTP,14,"<neutrality>  I plan my plans in a simple order, but there are more times when things don't go as I want, so I mix things up that I want to do and things I don't want to do while looking at the situation at that time."
4395,74,1,30,ISTP,15,"<neutrality>  I'm not worried about who I'll look like, but I'm curious. I became more and more curious as I met my husband's acquaintances and helped him with his work."
4396,74,1,30,ISTP,16,"<no>  Rather than doing group activities, I feel more comfortable and like doing hobbies alone at home."
4397,74,1,30,ISTP,17,"<neutrality> Books and movies where you can interpret the ending in your own way are good, but on the other hand, it's because there is also anticipation of how the author will end it later. So lately I've been into fantasy web novels."
4398,74,1,30,ISTP,18,"<no>  When my child succeeds, it gives me great satisfaction, but not for others. It's because I can help my family or people around me succeed only when I succeed myself."
4399,74,1,30,ISTP,19,"<Yes> Recently, I am interested in illustration and motion graphics, so I am studying, but since the self-study programs are divided, there were times when it was difficult to know what to do first."
4400,74,1,30,ISTP,20,"<Yes>  It's the first time it's happened, and I'm often worried because it's a situation where I'm wrong and have to do it again."
4401,74,1,30,ISTP,21,"<Yes>  This is because when you take on the role of a leader, the number of responsibilities increases and the burden increases."
4402,74,1,30,ISTP,22,"<Yes>  It's because when I draw or design something, the image or idea I want to express doesn't come to mind."
4403,74,1,30,ISTP,23,"<Yes>  It's because if you value rationality, you'll be able to make more efficient judgments when making decisions."
4404,74,1,30,ISTP,24,"<Yes>  If you finish the housework first, the house will be clean and refreshing, so you can rest comfortably."
4405,74,1,30,ISTP,25,"<Yes>  Bok-Kyung, just like watching a fight is the most fun, it's because watching is much more fun than debating on your own."
4406,74,1,30,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  I think I'm the type of person who tries not to draw attention to myself, from talking to people I'm interested in first."
4407,74,1,30,ISTP,27,"<Yes>  When I do housework while taking care of the children, I find the children playing cute while trying to clean up the messy house."
4408,74,1,30,ISTP,28,"<neutrality> When I see someone who is not as efficient as I am, I feel a sense of kinship with them, but I also feel frustrated. It was also an opportunity for me to look back on myself, thinking that I had acted like that when I saw people similar to me."
4409,74,1,30,ISTP,29,"<Yes>  Lately, I really, really don't want to do laundry, so there are many cases where I put it off until bedtime and then do it later."
4410,74,1,30,ISTP,30,"<Yes>  If there is an afterlife, it means that dying now is not the end. I wonder if there will be another new life or lifestyle."
4411,74,1,30,ISTP,31,"<no>  I like spending time alone these days. If you do hobbies at home alone, you will be healed."
4412,74,1,30,ISTP,32,"<neutrality>  I don't really know as I'm not really interested in either. Because a theory has grounds, there is a theme that the theory supports, and the original theory is a story related to the topic itself, so I think each has a slightly different meaning."
4413,74,1,30,ISTP,33,"<Yes> Although the backgrounds are different, we can relate to what everyone has experienced at least once because others have experienced the same or similar experiences."
4414,74,1,30,ISTP,34,"<Yes>  I want to buy something I want, but when I'm thinking about whether I should buy it or not, I put it off as much as I can and decide after an event like a discount event ends, or I decide to buy it at the next opportunity and put it off."
4415,74,1,30,ISTP,35,"<neutrality>  usually think about it a little bit and then move on as I decided. It's because if you keep rethinking what you've decided, you won't be able to do anything else."
4416,74,1,30,ISTP,36,<no>  It's best to spend time alone. I usually take a nap or watch my favorite anime or movie to relieve fatigue.
4417,74,1,30,ISTP,37,"<neutrality>  I'm interested, but I don't deliberately go there to appreciate art. But if I need a creative idea, I want to find art and see it."
4418,74,1,30,ISTP,38,"<neutrality>  It's hard to understand people who say that working is resting when you're tired and sick and you need to rest, but you feel depressed because it's frustrating to stay at home."
4419,74,1,30,ISTP,39,"<neutrality>  I like to keep my schedule simple. However, things rarely go according to plan, so except for most important things, it changes according to the situation of the day."
4420,74,1,30,ISTP,40,"<Yes>  It seems like an innate tendency. When it comes to making a plan, for example, no matter how detailed a plan is, there are always cases where the plan goes wrong, so I give up and find another way or just leave it alone. However, it doesn't get bigger or bigger, so I think I've developed a tendency to feel little anxiety."
4421,74,1,30,ISTP,41,"<Yes> Sometimes when I make a phone call, I'm at a loss as to what to start with. The person on the phone and the awkward silence are also uncomfortable."
4422,74,1,30,ISTP,42,"<no>  Whenever there is a conflict of opinion with my husband, there are many times when I pursue my husband's opinion. Because if you think about it again, your husband's opinion is more effective than your own opinion."
4423,74,1,30,ISTP,43,"<no>  When it comes to contacting friends, I don't communicate well unless they contact me."
4424,74,1,30,ISTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, we proceed with the plan by changing it little by little according to the situation. When I usually go on weekends, I would change the course if a new place appeared on the course I had planned."
4425,74,1,30,ISTP,45,"<no>  I usually don't think about bad things, so I don't regret or do anything."
4426,74,1,30,ISTP,46,"<Yes>  think we live because humans exist. The reason is that humans exist by evolving in the past, such as history. I think how you live now is more important."
4427,74,1,30,ISTP,47,"<Yes>  I feel that my emotions are out of control, both in the people around me and in myself. It's because I've increased my annoyance over insignificant things."
4428,74,1,30,ISTP,48,<no>  It's true that the other person did something wrong. I think it's more important to make a mistake than the face of the other person.
4441,75,1,40,ENTJ,1,"<Yes>  I am good at adapting, so I am good at making friends with new people regardless of my age, and the reason is that I am good at talking to new people and strangers in new places."
4442,75,1,40,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  I am very interested in health information and diet, and I look for a lot of information. The reason is that I am a cancer survivor, so health is the biggest concern in my life."
4443,75,1,40,ENTJ,3,"<no>  I'm not like that at all. The reason is that one of the things I hate the most is crying. And since I'm not moved by my emotions, I don't feel any of that."
4444,75,1,40,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  I always prepare for things that don't go well rather than things that go well. The reason is that there are unexpected unexpected variables, so I tend to think of several countermeasures."
4445,75,1,40,ENTJ,5,"<no>  I can never keep my composure. The reason is that he has a quick-tempered personality and tends to be distracted, so he makes a lot of mistakes and all efficiency is reduced due to pressure."
4446,75,1,40,ENTJ,6,"<neutrality>  talk to people I already know, and I also approach and talk to new people first. The reason is because I have an active personality that approaches people first, and sometimes I talk to people I already know, so I think it's half and half."
4447,75,1,40,ENTJ,7,"<no>  I have a lot of different experiences. The reason is because I have a lot of curiosity, so I have a personality that tries a lot of things first."
4448,75,1,40,ENTJ,8,"<no>  am very rational. The reason is that I've been through a lot of difficult health experiences, so I tend to keep a calm side a lot, so I can say that I'm very far from being sentimental."
4449,75,1,40,ENTJ,9,"<no>  I like to think with my head and I don't have much of a habit of recording. I think it's because I'm the type who thinks a lot and likes to remember things, but I honestly don't know."
4450,75,1,40,ENTJ,10,<Yes> Sometimes I blame myself for minor mistakes. The reason is that I sometimes have a very harsh and intolerant side to myself.
4451,75,1,40,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  I don't find it very difficult to talk to people I'm interested in. The reason is because if I'm interested, I want to have a conversation, of course."
4452,75,1,40,ENTJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in talking about works of art. The reason is that even if you appreciate a work of art, you are not particularly good at interpreting it."
4453,75,1,40,ENTJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. My judgment and the evaluations of those around me are similar, and I am not very moved by my emotions. The reason is that when going through a difficult situation, rather than getting frustrated or worried, I tend to find a way to solve it at that time."
4454,75,1,40,ENTJ,14,"<Yes>  like to be very spontaneous. Based on my experience, it's 100 percent the same. The reason is because he is the kind of person who sees the end when he suddenly decides to do something."
4455,75,1,40,ENTJ,15,"<Yes>  I don't care too much about how other people look at me. The reason is that I live a busy life, but I think it's a waste of time to care about how I look to others."
4456,75,1,40,ENTJ,16,"<neutrality>  tend to enjoy group activities that I think are necessary, and not so much when I don't. I think the reason is because my personality tends to weigh a lot of gains and losses."
4457,75,1,40,ENTJ,17,"<no>  I'm not very like that. The reason is that I do not watch books and movies to interpret them in my own way, but I tend to watch movies especially for leisure activities, so it can be said that it is far from that."
4458,75,1,40,ENTJ,18,"<no>  I feel great when I've accomplished something myself, but I don't find much satisfaction in helping others. The reason is that my life is important and I live my life on my own, so I don't understand why I should help others succeed."
4459,75,1,40,ENTJ,19,"<no>  don't have many interests. The reason is that my biggest concern is health. If I'm not healthy, it's too hard on my body and mind, so it's too much for me to receive attention."
4460,75,1,40,ENTJ,20,<no>  I don't worry often. The reason is that I was so mentally and physically exhausted because I was afraid in advance that things would go wrong and then never happened.
4461,75,1,40,ENTJ,21,<Yes>  would like to avoid taking on leadership roles as much as possible. The reason is that leading a lot of people is too much for me to think about and I don't want to do it because there are so many things to take care of.
4462,75,1,40,ENTJ,22,"<Yes>  I don't have much talent or interest in art. The reason is that it's not my favorite part, and I don't think it's the right disposition to do art."
4463,75,1,40,ENTJ,23,"<no>  don't think it matters much. The reason is that sometimes emotions are more important than reason, and sometimes not, so I don't think it will be a better world just because I put importance on reason unconditionally."
4464,75,1,40,ENTJ,24,"<no>  I am not. The reason is that when you need a break too much, you have a strong belief that rest is a priority."
4465,75,1,40,ENTJ,25,"<no>  I'm not happy The reason is, I don't understand how many people would enjoy watching other people's arguments."
4466,75,1,40,ENTJ,26,<Yes>  I'm not trying to get other people's attention. The reason is that I don't have any reason to try to get other people's attention.
4467,75,1,40,ENTJ,27,"<no>  My feelings don't change that quickly. The reason is that he is not the type of person with severe emotional ups and downs, and he is not a personality with advanced emotional aspects."
4468,75,1,40,ENTJ,28,"<no>  I am not. The reason is that being efficient is relative, and it is because I have no reason to evaluate others."
4469,75,1,40,ENTJ,29,"<Yes>  I often do things that I have to do near the end. The reason is that there is a habit of shutting up, but recently I think it's better to hit first anyway, so it's less than before."
4470,75,1,40,ENTJ,30,<Yes>  I find it very interesting. The reason is because they are too interested in life's life.
4471,75,1,40,ENTJ,31,"<no>  I like spending time alone. The reason is that there are many times when spending time alone is more comfortable than spending time with others, and I don't have to worry about others and I can fully focus on myself. I still like spending time alone."
4472,75,1,40,ENTJ,32,"<Yes>  I find it very boring. The reason is that as we live, we feel that there is nothing that fits the theory and that the world is diverse."
4473,75,1,40,ENTJ,33,"<no>  I can't. The reason is, I just don't understand how you can easily empathize with someone from a different background than me, and it's hard for anyone to fully understand someone else."
4474,75,1,40,ENTJ,34,<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly. The reason is because I don't like to think about something for a long time until the end.
4475,75,1,40,ENTJ,35,<no>  Sometimes I regret the decisions I've already made. The reason is because I wonder how many people don't think twice when making a decision.
4476,75,1,40,ENTJ,36,"<no>  I still enjoy my alone time. The reason is that I think the fatigue of the week is a break, so I still enjoy taking a break by myself. What party are you having in Corona City? nonsense."
4477,75,1,40,ENTJ,37,<no>  I don't really like going to art galleries. Because it's not my interest.
4478,75,1,40,ENTJ,38,<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding others. The reason is that I don't really need to fully understand other people's feelings.
4479,75,1,40,ENTJ,39,"<no>  don't like to plan my daily tasks. The reason is that it's daunting to live every day, but why would you like to plan what to do every day? I do it whenever I think of it."
4480,75,1,40,ENTJ,40,<Yes>  I don't feel very anxious. The reason is probably that the biggest trigger was going through a major illness called cancer twice.
4481,75,1,40,ENTJ,41,<no>  I don't hate talking on the phone. The reason is that you don't want to avoid it.
4482,75,1,40,ENTJ,42,<no>  I am not. I think it's a waste of time to spend a lot of time trying to understand your opinion because you have a very different opinion than me.
4483,75,1,40,ENTJ,43,<neutrality>  I am half and half. The reason is that there are times when I contact you first and there are times when my friend contacts me first.
4484,75,1,40,ENTJ,44,"<no>  respond according to the circumstances. The reason is that disruption to the plan means that unexpected situations can always occur, so you can flexibly revise your plan."
4485,75,1,40,ENTJ,45,"<no>  I am not. The reason is that the past cannot be undone, so it is useless to think about it."
4486,75,1,40,ENTJ,46,"<no>  I think deeply about human life sometimes. The reason is that people are human, so it would be rather strange for people who don't think like that."
4487,75,1,40,ENTJ,47,"<no>  I am not swayed by emotions. The reason is that I also overcame severe illness several times and went through great difficulties, so I think so too, but most of the people around me admit it as well."
4488,75,1,40,ENTJ,48,"<no>  I don't bother trying. The reason is that the other person's fault is obvious, but I'm rather curious if there is a reason for me to save the other person's face."
4501,76,1,40,INTP,1,<no>  I don't deliberately create opportunities to meet interesting new people. Invest that time into your life or spend time with existing friends.
4502,76,1,40,INTP,2,"<Yes>  These days, my interest is in video production. I am exploring drone filming, video planning and editing, looking for data, and making my ideas into videos."
4503,76,1,40,INTP,3,"<Yes> It's not always like that, but there are times when I want to cry when I see the hardships and overcoming of the characters in the movie or drama novel that I can relate to."
4504,76,1,40,INTP,4,"<Yes>  This is because when something goes wrong, if you execute a prepared backup plan in a short time, you can minimize human casualties and prevent the spread of secondary damage, thereby reducing the size of the damage."
4505,76,1,40,INTP,5,"<neutrality>  had a great opportunity to pioneer a new field, but there was an incident where I couldn't completely make the opportunity my own due to lack of preparation, and it was not easy to maintain my composure for several days."
4506,76,1,40,INTP,6,"<Yes>  I want to talk to people I don't know, but I'm worried about how to have a pleasant conversation because I don't know the subject of interest."
4507,76,1,40,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  If it's not an individual project, I tend to work according to the nature of the project's needs and the situation I'm in."
4508,76,1,40,INTP,8,<neutrality>  I worked for a long time paralleling scientific analysis and photography. So it depends on my situation and my mood for the day.
4509,76,1,40,INTP,9,<no>  I don't like to make plans unless I have to stick to a schedule. I usually only record deadlines in the scheduler.
4510,76,1,40,INTP,10,"<Yes> My recent missed opportunity was a case of lack of preparation regardless of my ability, but lack of preparation also felt like a lack of thoughtfulness on my part."
4511,76,1,40,INTP,11,"<neutrality>  It depends on whether or not there is information about the one you are interested in. If there is a little bit of information, we start a conversation with related small talk."
4512,76,1,40,INTP,12,"<no> Rather, it is a pity for those who understand that the interpretation of famous critics is the answer. This is because a work of art can create a new interpretation that the artist did not even think of when it meets the background knowledge of the viewer."
4513,76,1,40,INTP,13,"<neutrality>  It depends. Even the evaluations around me speak coldly and rationally about work, but I hear that I am a warm-hearted person when it comes to people's work."
4514,76,1,40,INTP,14,"<Yes> In modern society, there are more cases where things don't go as planned, especially travel plans are 100 percent failure, so when you have time, you leave immediately."
4515,76,1,40,INTP,15,"<no>  I don't think I can hide my weaknesses and ugliness from being revealed. I just try to strengthen the good side and complement the weak and ugly parts. Also, since the standard for judging me as good or bad depends on the value of the person who sees me, I cannot be the perfect me as judged by that person."
4516,76,1,40,INTP,16,"<neutrality>  I don't enjoy it, and if I have to participate in a group activity, I try to enjoy it without avoiding it."
4517,76,1,40,INTP,17,<neutrality>  I don't like the way it ends with an open ending regardless of the overall completeness.
4518,76,1,40,INTP,18,"<neutrality>  I tend to be more satisfied with my success in leading my own success or in helping others succeed, but I also find satisfaction in helping the success of family members or loved ones."
4519,76,1,40,INTP,19,"<neutrality>  There are times like that, and there are times when I'm lost or in a daze because I don't know what to do."
4520,76,1,40,INTP,20,<Yes>  I am often worried because I have experienced that many things I have tried fail one after another for various reasons beyond my control.
4521,76,1,40,INTP,21,"<Yes>  There are levels and qualities that a leader must have, but I would like to avoid cases where I do not meet that level as much as possible."
4522,76,1,40,INTP,22,"<no>  It seems that a lot of artistic inclinations are innate, but I think they don't know how to express it because scientific education and learning are more important than artistic education."
4523,76,1,40,INTP,23,"<no>  Since reason and emotion coexist in humans, and the world is a mixture of the two areas, more problems may arise when judged by reason or emotion alone."
4524,76,1,40,INTP,24,"<neutrality>  When I am so tired that I need to take a break, I take a break first. However, if you can afford to move enough, you may finish the work first."
4525,76,1,40,INTP,25,"<neutrality>  I enjoy discussions because they allow me to find a solution or a better solution, but I want to avoid pessimistic or pointless debates."
4526,76,1,40,INTP,26,"<Yes> As long as it doesn't contradict your values, you are naturally absorbed in it or follow its atmosphere."
4527,76,1,40,INTP,27,"<neutrality>  It depends on the case and topic. Sometimes I find myself excited or happy, but there are also cases where I am keeping my composure."
4528,76,1,40,INTP,28,"<Yes>  It's a pity at first, but when you see the same case over and over again, you get annoyed. And I'll do it myself."
4529,76,1,40,INTP,29,"<Yes>  It doesn't happen every time, but it's a lot more procrastination. People say that because the desire to do well is a burden, but I wonder if it is a rationalization of laziness."
4530,76,1,40,INTP,30,"<Yes>  It is of course interesting because it is an unknown area that no one has told me about, and my new hypothesis about the afterlife has recently emerged, which has made it even more interesting because I have the desire to confirm the facts."
4531,76,1,40,INTP,31,<Yes>  I wanted to spend time with other people because I was curious about other people's opinions on the videos I shot.
4532,76,1,40,INTP,32,"<no>  Stories that shake the conventional notions and notions, or fundamental stories that are necessary to understand humans and society are interesting."
4533,76,1,40,INTP,33,"<Yes> As a person whose job is to analyze people and find reasons for their actions, I think I am the type to understand and empathize with people¡¯s situations better than others, and people around me tend to evaluate them that way."
4534,76,1,40,INTP,34,"<neutrality>  Complex cases that have not been experienced before take a long time to find a variable, but usually not long"
4535,76,1,40,INTP,35,"<neutrality>  When conditions (variables) change, I tend to think again and try to find the right and correct way."
4536,76,1,40,INTP,36,"<no>  tend to find a lot of fun and interesting things in my alone time, so I hate parties and events."
4537,76,1,40,INTP,37,"<Yes>  I like good works of art because they delightfully and delightfully subvert the formula, and I can feel a new perspective."
4538,76,1,40,INTP,38,<no>  It is rare to encounter other people's incomprehensible emotions. It's usually easy to understand when you understand the person's background and environment.
4539,76,1,40,INTP,39,"<no> Outside of work, I don't like planning. One of the things I hate the most is making reservations."
4540,76,1,40,INTP,40,"<no>  I feel anxious often and live with anxiety disorder, and I have been taking treatment and medication for a while."
4541,76,1,40,INTP,41,"<Yes>  When the phone rings, your heart beats faster. It seems more likely that personal bad experiences are related to the phone and stressed about responding to strangers."
4542,76,1,40,INTP,42,"<neutrality>  It depends. If you explain clearly or answer a question I ask, I tend to try to understand other opinions."
4543,76,1,40,INTP,43,"<neutrality>  If there is an issue to meet or an opinion is needed, let's meet first, and it is rare to contact if there is no distance to contact."
4544,76,1,40,INTP,44,"<neutrality> It used to be like that before, but lately I'm finding myself feeling lethargic and less motivated."
4545,76,1,40,INTP,45,"<neutrality>  It seems to vary from case to case. It feels like regret is a big part because usually regrets come to mind, but..."
4546,76,1,40,INTP,46,"<Yes>  It's a matter of value for sustaining or suspending life, and it's interesting because the responses are different."
4547,76,1,40,INTP,47,"<neutrality> To be honest, I think it's more accurate to say I don't know. I try to control my emotions, but I often feel like I'm being swayed."
4548,76,1,40,INTP,48,<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the opponent's attitude. I don't want to save face if someone who doesn't admit their mistakes has a bad attitude.
4561,77,1,30,ENFP,1,"<no>  I make friends when I start a new activity, rather than making new ones periodically. I mostly hang out with old friends."
4562,77,1,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  I have a variety of interests and I like to explore different fields. These days, I'm interested in inner psychological healing and meditation."
4563,77,1,30,ENFP,3,"<neutrality>  When someone else is crying, you feel emotionally sad. However, I tend to suppress my feelings of wanting to cry in order not to express my feelings more than the other person."
4564,77,1,30,ENFP,4,"<Yes> Even if it's not a lot of preparation, I tend to consider plan B. That's why we tend to try to prevent unexpected embarrassing situations as much as possible."
4565,77,1,30,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  Tension arises inside, but I tend to keep my composure as much as possible. Recently, I was exposed to unfamiliar environments and people due to family events, and I tried to accept all situations comfortably."
4566,77,1,30,ENFP,6,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different depending on the condition of the day. Some days you become more assertive, and other days you seem to want to be with someone you already know. I think it's because I'm well influenced by the surrounding environment, people, and physical condition."
4567,77,1,30,ENFP,7,"<no>  I focus on one thing at a time, but when I have multiple projects, I also split my time and finish them in parts."
4568,77,1,30,ENFP,8,"<neutrality>  He is not very sentimental, but he has a personality that is easily influenced and moved by the mood around him. However, there are times when the rational part is strong, so I am generally neutral."
4569,77,1,30,ENFP,9,"<no>  They make plans when necessary, but they don't seem to be specific. I also use a diary, but I use it for recording past events rather than planning."
4570,77,1,30,ENFP,10,"<Yes>  You tend to avoid making mistakes, so you tend to waver a bit when small mistakes happen. However, I try to regain my self-esteem by reflecting on it. Lately, small feedback from work seems to have lowered my motivation a little."
4571,77,1,30,ENFP,11,"<neutrality>  I don't find it difficult to start a conversation, but I don't think I usually approach and start a conversation first."
4572,77,1,30,ENFP,12,"<no>  I really enjoy debating different interpretations, and I don't really like it when a group's opinion is overly biased. Multiple interpretations seem to be interesting because they allow us to see the unseen."
4573,77,1,30,ENFP,13,<neutrality>  It seems that important decisions are on the side of reason. People around you seem to think that you make decisions with composure.
4574,77,1,30,ENFP,14,"<Yes>  If there is nothing important to do, it seems to improvise with only rough guidelines. I try to choose the one that appeals to me as much as possible."
4575,77,1,30,ENFP,15,"<neutrality> When I was young, I was somewhat obsessive about that, but as I met many people, I realized that people are most interested in their own work and have a rather superficial interest in others. That's why I tend to pay more attention to keeping myself centered rather than being too shaken by other people's judgments."
4576,77,1,30,ENFP,16,"<neutrality>  In the past, I enjoyed group activities and interacting with people, but lately I seem to have more time alone."
4577,77,1,30,ENFP,17,<Yes>  think the ending of every work has room for interpretation in one's own way. And I like to think about the ending in my own way. Recently I liked the movie Equals.
4578,77,1,30,ENFP,18,"<neutrality>  In some cases, it is very rewarding to help others succeed. In other cases, I feel satisfied when I achieve something. However, rather than focusing on me and others, satisfaction seems to depend on the situation."
4579,77,1,30,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  It's a lot of interest, but it doesn't seem overly confusing because you do one and move on to the other. Recently, my interest in making light games has shifted to crocheting."
4580,77,1,30,ENFP,20,"<no> It's not without worries, but I don't worry often. The reason is that many worries seem to cause burnout, and there are times when unexpected solutions come up when you leave it alone."
4581,77,1,30,ENFP,21,"<neutrality>  When given a role, I don't avoid it, but I don't actively try to take it. Because if there's someone better suited, I think it's better for him to take over."
4582,77,1,30,ENFP,22,"<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. When I took a personality test as a child, it came out that I had artistic inclinations. And I'm interested in various fields of art, and I like doing things. In all areas of life, if you come up with creative ideas outside of the existing framework, I think that is also art."
4583,77,1,30,ENFP,23,"<no>  I think balance should be emphasized rather than the comparative viewpoint of reason over emotion. For example, when we speak out against the underdog, we don't think that rational solutions make us less emotional. I think we can present a rational solution with sufficient empathy for the pain of the weak. Rather, I think being too emotional can cause another discrimination."
4584,77,1,30,ENFP,24,"<Yes>  After finishing housework, I feel like I have a longer break time, so I try to relax after work."
4585,77,1,30,ENFP,25,"<Yes>  They don't mind seeing constructive arguments, not just fights for the fight's sake. It's because I can organize my thoughts while looking at various opinions, and it seems to broaden my horizons."
4586,77,1,30,ENFP,26,"<Yes> In some cases, it seems like you want to be invisible, and in other cases, you seem to get attention even when you don't want to. It seems to be just a difference in tension."
4587,77,1,30,ENFP,27,"<no>  It doesn't seem to change very quickly. When sadness happens, I tend to feel enough sadness, and when anger arises, I feel anger. Emotions seem to flow like a calm stream."
4588,77,1,30,ENFP,28,"<neutrality>  It seems to vary from case to case. If the part that is not efficient is for another reason, I try to understand it, and if I am not efficient while insisting on my opinion too much, I get a little annoyed."
4589,77,1,30,ENFP,29,"<no>  Originally, I tended to procrastinate a little, but I try not to procrastinate until the end because procrastinating too much seems to put more pressure on myself."
4590,77,1,30,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  I think it's interesting. This is because we believe that humans are not simply beings with a physical body, but that there are some unconscious parts that continue from the past. So I wonder how something beyond the physical body will go on after death."
4591,77,1,30,ENFP,31,"<no>  There seems to be a certain cycle, but it seems that I prefer being alone more recently."
4592,77,1,30,ENFP,32,"<no>  I don't think it's boring. Rather, I think it's good that you can get factual and accurate information, and that it can help you have a sharper perspective. For example, when analyzing the economy, I think it is fun to predict trends based on data and theory."
4593,77,1,30,ENFP,33,"<neutrality>  can't say I sympathize easily, but I seem to be interested in people from other backgrounds. If I can understand the process of that person's life, I try to empathize with them while understanding them from various angles."
4594,77,1,30,ENFP,34,"<Yes>  It seems that the more important things are, the more I tend to keep thinking about them and try to keep more possibilities open."
4595,77,1,30,ENFP,35,"<Yes> At the time of making a decision, I think that I have decided enough before making a decision, so I tend not to think about the decision I have already made, no matter what the outcome, even if I have some regrets."
4596,77,1,30,ENFP,36,"<no>  In the past, I relieved stress by having fun in the city, but these days, it seems like I spend time with my family or alone because of the situation."
4597,77,1,30,ENFP,37,"<Yes>  like. Even if it's a small exhibition, if it's open while walking down the street, I tend to go in and look around. I think it's the little fun of everyday life."
4598,77,1,30,ENFP,38,"<no>  I'm interested in psychology, so it's not hard to understand. However, the part that repeatedly causes problems seems to be difficult to understand."
4599,77,1,30,ENFP,39,<neutrality>  There doesn't seem to be any likes or dislikes about the plan. It seems to do or not do it out of necessity. I don't usually make plans in detail.
4600,77,1,30,ENFP,40,"<no>  You feel anxious in new situations or in situations where you are expected to do well. However, as I exposed the anxious situation instead of avoiding it, the intensity of the anxiety decreased somewhat compared to the past."
4601,77,1,30,ENFP,41,"<neutrality>  When necessary, I prefer the phone over other means, but there are times when I want to avoid calling strangers. Perhaps it is because of the fear of vague situations."
4602,77,1,30,ENFP,42,"<neutrality>  I don't spend a lot of time, but I try to look at it from a different perspective by looking for related materials and videos. For example, I tend to find out about various opinions about social issues such as conflicting political issues."
4603,77,1,30,ENFP,43,"<neutrality>  My friend asks to meet first, or I ask to meet first, or it seems like half-and-half."
4604,77,1,30,ENFP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, it seems that the plan is changed according to the situation. Recently, moving to another area has been disrupted, so I have changed my plans to use transportation or use a friend's house."
4605,77,1,30,ENFP,45,"<Yes>  There are times when I regret what I would have done if I had made a different choice. These days, I regret not being better for my late father."
4606,77,1,30,ENFP,46,"<no>  I tend to think deeply. One of the things that differentiates humans from animals is that they can think at a higher level, and without in-depth consideration of life, they think that if they make a mistake, they can lead a life that is no different from that of animals. Although not all answers are the same, I believe that if you think deeply and live your life according to your values, you will not have any regrets."
4607,77,1,30,ENFP,47,"<neutrality>  Normally, I tend to control my emotions, but when my stress level rises, I seem to be swayed by my emotions. The evaluation seems to be half and half around."
4608,77,1,30,ENFP,48,"<no>  If each person's fault is obvious, I think it's a developmental direction to admit and correct it and get better. When the other person's fault is obvious, there are times when I would rather be silent about the situation and not embarrass myself."
4621,78,1,40,INFP,1,"<neutrality>  If you have new acquaintances or situations, you can talk to them or make new friends by drinking tea if you want to get closer. It's not intentional, it's possible depending on the situation, so it's called neutral."
4622,78,1,40,INFP,2,"<Yes> When I have free time, I explore things that I have always been curious about or wanted to know more about. I am interested in watching TV programs or documentaries that I have seen in articles, but these days I want to acquire knowledge from books, so I subscribe to Millie's library and try to read bestsellers or recommended books little by little. It seems to be helpful to do it for a while rather than grandiosely."
4623,78,1,40,INFP,3,"<Yes> Originally, I was on the side of empathy, but it got worse because my hormones exploded during pregnancy and childbirth. Tears well up in my eyes just by hearing the story, and there are many cases where tears flow out of my eyes or my heart thumps while watching TV."
4624,78,1,40,INFP,4,"<neutrality>  In the worst case, it is built, but most of the time, it is promoted under the assumption that it will be the best."
4625,78,1,40,INFP,5,"<Yes>  tend to get more excited about other people's work than tomorrow, but recently I've been so stressed out because of the noise between floors that I wrote a letter and complained to the management office. Rather than expressing anger right away in an angry situation, he tried to figure out the core of the problem, and after the situation was over, he wrote a letter and delivered the information objectively, assuming that the upper floor did not understand the characteristics of the building. The person upstairs who received the letter came down and screamed and made a fuss, but we calmly explained and talked about the damage situation, time and extent of our house. I'm angry, but I know it won't help, so I breathe and talk as calmly as possible."
4626,78,1,40,INFP,6,"<neutrality> If there are people I know, I go and have a conversation, and if I am going among people I do not know, I spend time checking the atmosphere and talking about the weather or simple small talk to people around me."
4627,78,1,40,INFP,7,"<no>  Big projects have different styles and roles, so when the tension rises, the work is usually promoted at once. Then, when they run out of energy or lose interest, they are more inclined to end or end the whole drive."
4628,78,1,40,INFP,8,"<Yes>  There is a mix of rational and sentimental things, but most of the time I like the emotional or detailed aspects of art or video."
4629,78,1,40,INFP,9,"<Yes> Originally, it was a style of bumping into each other without a plan, but I came to experience that this pleasure cannot be possible if you have to make a reservation or hit the system. In order to enjoy my free time, I mark it in a memo or diary and try to enjoy my freedom as much as possible within the schedule."
4630,78,1,40,INFP,10,"<no> Even if others underestimate me, I am not shaken by that. I have the belief that if I set my mind to it, I can do it, and if I work hard, I can go up to some extent. There was a case where I had to apologize and sort out the situation because I had made a mistake recently. Even while receiving negative feedback, I received this evaluation because I was not able to concentrate and properly grasp the focus. I apologized and tried again and got recognized again."
4631,78,1,40,INFP,11,"<neutrality> It's not easy. But it's not difficult either. I don't want to look light, but I don't want to approach the fear again, so I'm going to collect information as much as possible, find a topic or situation that can be together, and create an opportunity to get closer."
4632,78,1,40,INFP,12,"<no> Works of art tend to look newer as they get older. When I went to an art gallery or museum, especially in a foreign country, I was shocked by its grandeur and detail, and I felt that what I saw in books and paintings was superficial and limited. Even in the case of a play or a movie, as I get older, I wonder if I will be able to do something like that when I encounter that situation."
4633,78,1,40,INFP,13,"<Yes>  think it's rational. However, the evaluations around it are mixed. I thought I would be rational at work, but I was evaluated as emotional, and I thought I would be emotional at home, but I was evaluated as rational. The social weight depending on the role or situation is different, so it seems to be more rigid at work."
4634,78,1,40,INFP,14,"<neutrality>  like to improvise, but in light of my experience, no matter what I try to improvise, I can't do it if the situation doesn't allow it. Even if you work hard to go to an art museum, you can't because it's a holiday on Monday."
4635,78,1,40,INFP,15,"<no> When I was young, I was swayed by such evaluations and appearances a lot, and that was also my goal. However, realizing that it is an illusion and weighs too much for me and is not my real self, I first figure out what I want to do and want to do as much as possible, and try to do that."
4636,78,1,40,INFP,16,"<neutrality>  enjoy There are religious activities, friends gatherings, and many gatherings. But now it's Corona and I'm raising a 33-month-old child, so I can't do it temporarily."
4637,78,1,40,INFP,17,"<no> The open ending seems to be stressing the distance. I just have to see it and come to a conclusion whether it goes well or not, I feel comfortable, and I want to see the end there."
4638,78,1,40,INFP,18,"<neutrality> Working in social welfare for over 10 years, I spent a lot of worth and energy helping others' interests and lives rather than my own success. However, I realized that if my life and satisfaction are not fulfilled, I feel tired quickly and my life is devastated, so I learned that I can truly enjoy the joy of helping others when I have to cherish my own things and fill my time alone."
4639,78,1,40,INFP,19,"<Yes>  I had free time, so I just wanted to watch Netflix or a video, but I couldn't find something I liked or couldn't choose, so there were many cases where I watched it briefly and time passed."
4640,78,1,40,INFP,20,"<Yes>  During the day, I am positive and confident that I can do anything, but when I go to bed or when my body hurts, I get worried or anxious, so it's hard to shake it off. Whenever that happens, I try to find conviction in my heart by praying religiously or reading sermons or the Bible."
4641,78,1,40,INFP,21,"<Yes> Taking the lead is natural if you do well, and if you don¡¯t, you will be criticized, so I want to avoid a noisy position if possible. It is burdensome to take the lead because I can't say anything in dictatorship, and if I leave the seat open peacefully, people will look at it and stir it up."
4642,78,1,40,INFP,22,"<Yes>  In art class or music class, I don't seem to be very creative. It's fun to make or imitate things that have been set up mainly for practice, but I'm not interested in abstract or creative things, and the process isn't fun either."
4643,78,1,40,INFP,23,"<neutrality>  It seems to be the really difficult part. I don't think emotions and rationality should be considered more important. It can't be. We make choices according to the situation, and those choices accumulate to become a person and a society."
4644,78,1,40,INFP,24,"<no> It seems that true relaxation is comfortable and pleasant to do in a pleasant environment. But when I get too tired, I just want to get away from it, so I just take a break, and my tension drops, so the house is always a mess. Housework seems too repetitive and uninteresting."
4645,78,1,40,INFP,25,"<no>  do watch 100 minute discussions or something like this once in a while. It seems that it is interesting and great in terms of obtaining information to exchange thoughts in a healthy way with experts' opinions or each other's opinions. However, in the case of certain channels or broadcasts, it is uncomfortable to listen to because it always responds only emotionally to the exasperated tone, and it is annoying to hear only the sound or tone of voice, so I hate it."
4646,78,1,40,INFP,26,"<Yes>  I don't need other people's attention, and I don't want to be noticed that much. I want to quickly finish my errands quietly and not be seen, and leave the place nicely."
4647,78,1,40,INFP,27,"<Yes>  I was having a meeting and having a conversation, but my husband suddenly got annoyed with me and suddenly changed my mood as if he had poured cold water on me. Being treated carelessly or receiving negative feedback makes me embarrassed and wants to fight."
4648,78,1,40,INFP,28,"<Yes> It ends only when the set task is completed within the set time, but I was very angry because I was harmed by the unwise and fishy appearance. If you don't have the ability or don't know the answer, asking for help or advice from others seems to be courageous."
4649,78,1,40,INFP,29,"<Yes>  It seems that the work is done by deciding when to do it rather than when the situation is given. Now, there are times when I have to do things and rest, so I want to save them up until that time when I want to do them the best I can, and then cut them off at once."
4650,78,1,40,INFP,30,"<no>  I am a Christian, so I think the afterlife has already been decided. It is not very interesting to imagine and talk abstractly."
4651,78,1,40,INFP,31,"<neutrality> Alone time is also important, and there must be such a quietness to stabilize my emotions. However, now that I am raising children, I am exposed to daily repetitive daily life and stress, so I have to meet and talk with people who support me and understand me within a certain period of time to fill my energy."
4652,78,1,40,INFP,32,"<no>  Classics have the charm of classics, and I think practical work has the charm of practice. It is fun and interesting to hear about the history or people of other countries through the YouTube channel."
4653,78,1,40,INFP,33,"<Yes>  I can't understand it, but experience isn't everything, so I think people have their own weight and choices in life. I live in Korea, I am a woman, and I am raising a child, but the weight and worries of life are similar and difficult for everyone."
4654,78,1,40,INFP,34,"<Yes>  Decisions are important. Rather than doing it right away, I want to gather as much information as possible and think carefully before making the most of the given time."
4655,78,1,40,INFP,35,"<no>  I think once a decision is made, it is over. However, when faced with a difficult problem, there are many cases where the first option is the first option and the second option is the second option, thinking that there are pros and cons, so they just overturn it at the last minute."
4656,78,1,40,INFP,36,<Yes> It seems that the energy I receive from people and the positive power I get from the outside are greater. I find the worth of life and my identity a lot in the time with friends I missed or the energy I felt in hot places. You must have such time on a regular basis.
4657,78,1,40,INFP,37,"<Yes>  I also went to Europe for my honeymoon, and took time to see art galleries and commentary. Even though the times are different, I think there are many things to learn from the troubles and thoughts of life."
4658,78,1,40,INFP,38,"<neutrality>  It seems that each person feels the same in terms of anger or joy. However, I don't like it very much if the part that says that to the other person and expresses it is not sophisticated or coercive. When adults talk as if they are forcing their thoughts or force inaccurate information, they feel uncomfortable and do not want to be together."
4659,78,1,40,INFP,39,"<no> Write in a diary and do not plan meticulously. With a rough idea, I will try to solve it by leaving the timing or situation open like this around next week or summer."
4660,78,1,40,INFP,40,"<Yes>  Very positive and hopeful. I have faith that it is possible, and I have the conviction that it can be done. It seems that there is a part of it that is innate, and it seems that I have a religion and have personal time once a week to acquire knowledge, and I feel comforted and filled with wisdom there."
4661,78,1,40,INFP,41,"<no>  had a lot of work and phone calls. Grab a ballpoint pen, be ready to take notes, and keep your mind ready to expedite phone calls."
4662,78,1,40,INFP,42,"<no> It is difficult to agree with other opinions. I get angry when I hear it, and it's not easy to understand. However, if the situation cannot be changed, that person also judges with his own wisdom and knowledge and lives like that, so I think that if I see and feel it with his eyes, I will not be able to act like that. The lady upstairs who makes noise between floors every day is too proud to look downstairs and ask us to live with some understanding and consideration, but I think we should say that, not something we force ourselves to do. A really selfish person"
4663,78,1,40,INFP,43,"<neutrality>  There are friends who ask me to meet first, and there are friends who contact me first to ask me to meet them. It seems that the beginning of a relationship is different for each person."
4664,78,1,40,INFP,44,"<Yes>  Even in the case of part-time jobs, I thought the work would come in from the first half of 2022 at Crowd Works, but it was so quiet that the first half passed. I thought the whole year would pass if I waited, so I quickly looked for and found a job offline."
4665,78,1,40,INFP,45,"<Yes> There is no correct answer to the choice, but I seem to have lingering feelings for the path I have not been to. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I had been like this. As I went through pregnancy and childbirth, I thought more about it."
4666,78,1,40,INFP,46,"<no>  As puberty, work life, and marriage were delayed, I thought and worried a lot about why I live and why life is so hard and exhausting. In order to live diligently and feel happy, I think we can live by finding the answer to this question."
4667,78,1,40,INFP,47,"<Yes>  I want to control it, but in fact I am being swayed. I try to calm my mind by myself and try to change the atmosphere. It's fortunate that we come to a conclusion from our thoughts, and if it's not so, we try to express our anger in our hearts by going outside and playing baseball or doing a lot of physical activity."
4668,78,1,40,INFP,48,"<Yes> Even if the other person is the worst, I don't want to treat that person the worst and make myself a terrible person. I'm not that kind of person I'm a nice person"
4681,79,1,30,ISTJ,1,<no>  I don't make new friends. The reason is that it is not easy to meet and requires a lot of time to get to know.
4682,79,1,30,ISTJ,2,<Yes>  I'm interested in how I can learn resin craft or how to recover data. The reason is because I don't know how to do it.
4683,79,1,30,ISTJ,3,"<no>  Close friends wonder why, but usually don't care. The reason is something I can't solve."
4684,79,1,30,ISTJ,4,<Yes>  I tend to make at least one contingency plan. The reason is because you don't have confidence and you don't know the future.
4685,79,1,30,ISTJ,5,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation, but it is difficult to stay calm when panicked or excited. I was nervous during my recent job interview, but I kept my composure."
4686,79,1,30,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  That's right. The reason is because familiarity is comfortable and a little more conversation. If you are in an unfamiliar space, it is more comfortable to be familiar."
4687,79,1,30,ISTJ,7,"<neutrality>  If there is a shorter project in between, compare the two projects and prioritize them by comparing duration and speed of completion."
4688,79,1,30,ISTJ,8,"<neutrality>  Movies and books are often sentimental. But the number of them is small, so I consider them neutral."
4689,79,1,30,ISTJ,9,"<no>  Plan according to your needs. However, I don't think it's necessary to record normally, so I don't like to use it."
4690,79,1,30,ISTJ,10,"<neutrality>  When you are doing a high-important job, small mistakes can happen due to tension. I think there are areas where my skills are lacking, but I don't think there are many problems with my skills or knowledge because there are often mistakes that I can do."
4691,79,1,30,ISTJ,11,"<neutrality>  You can start a conversation if need be, but don't do it first. I became close with friends I met for the first time when I was a student by talking to them first, and now I have many friends I don't have."
4692,79,1,30,ISTJ,12,"<neutrality>  If I had seen a lot of art, I would have been interested in discussing it, but I didn't have time to work and raise my children. So naturally I lost interest."
4693,79,1,30,ISTJ,13,<Yes>  Friends say my attitude is cold. Following reason led to better results. I think the evaluation of the surroundings is similar.
4694,79,1,30,ISTJ,14,"<no>  There is no time to improvise. I don't spend the day making detailed plans, but the big picture is always the same."
4695,79,1,30,ISTJ,15,"<Yes> If you experience social life, more than 50% of people think they worry about who they look like. This is because it is a society where people live together rather than live alone."
4696,79,1,30,ISTJ,16,"<neutrality>  It's different from time to time, but these days, while working, I've experienced a work style that shows individualism. It's comfortable when I'm working, but I feel uncomfortable because there are few group activities."
4697,79,1,30,ISTJ,17,"<neutrality> Any book is good, and even if you are not interested in a movie, you will fall in love with it. I recently saw a movie called Intern, and I enjoyed it more than I thought. Although the ending was not decided, I was able to form a consensus with others."
4698,79,1,30,ISTJ,18,"<neutrality>  If you like the other person, you will feel satisfied even if you help them succeed. The reason is that helping my acquaintances is good, but I have never participated in anything big enough to feel the satisfaction of helping others."
4699,79,1,30,ISTJ,19,"<Yes> I'm always interested in things I can't do. I didn't know what to decide, so I looked up many things often and still couldn't decide."
4700,79,1,30,ISTJ,20,<no>  Haven't had any triggers yet. It hasn't gone wrong very often and I've never made or worked on anything big.
4701,79,1,30,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  I'm more suited to supporting from behind than playing a leadership role. If you assume a leadership role, you are likely to make many mistakes."
4702,79,1,30,ISTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I liked drawing when I was young, and I am still interested in pretty interiors and exhibitions. However, I am not good at making or expressing with my hands."
4703,79,1,30,ISTJ,23,"<no>  If only rationality was valued, I think it would have become a cold society. In the future, I think it might become a communist country like North Korea."
4704,79,1,30,ISTJ,24,"<neutrality>  It depends on your physical condition. If you are too tired, you may procrastinate chores. When you want chores to be done first, it's when you feel like you're pushed too far or that there's a lot to clean up."
4705,79,1,30,ISTJ,25,"<no>  It's good if the argument comes to a conclusion, but in most cases there is no end to it, and that situation is inconvenient."
4706,79,1,30,ISTJ,26,<Yes>  prefer to be quiet. I feel awkward when I'm not in a natural setting where I can participate in people's stories.
4707,79,1,30,ISTJ,27,"<no>  It doesn't change much unless something really upset happens. Sometimes when I get angry, tears automatically come out."
4708,79,1,30,ISTJ,28,"<Yes>  At the company I used to work for, there was an employee who was too young to work. I was frustrated the whole time watching the same thing because I worked harder, and the work became more difficult or difficult while working together."
4709,79,1,30,ISTJ,29,"<no>  Even lately, I try not to procrastinate. Because if you put it off until the end, you don't want to do it anymore and there is too much to do."
4710,79,1,30,ISTJ,30,"<Yes>  I tend to read a lot of novels, so I think there is an afterlife. The reason is that there are people around who have seen the grim reaper in their dreams."
4711,79,1,30,ISTJ,31,"<no> These days, I want to spend time alone. I feel like I need time to go on a trip alone or read a book quietly."
4712,79,1,30,ISTJ,32,"<neutrality>  To be precise, I'm not interested. I had no experience in discussing theories. As time goes by, it seems that we have less time to talk."
4713,79,1,30,ISTJ,33,"<no>  I can't sympathize. The reason is that you have to experience it to get empathy. No matter how much I try to empathize, I think a little understanding should be supported."
4714,79,1,30,ISTJ,34,"<neutrality>  It depends. It is often the case that decisions are made, rethought, and then overturned. Depending on the situation, there were cases where it was delayed even if you didn't want to postpone it until the end."
4715,79,1,30,ISTJ,35,"<no>  It is the nature of rethinking decisions. I'm not sure, but I take time to think again by accepting other people's opinions."
4716,79,1,30,ISTJ,36,"<no>  need to relieve fatigue, but parties and events do not relieve fatigue. These days, I want to sleep a lot because I have a lot of fatigue."
4717,79,1,30,ISTJ,37,"<Yes>  It's quiet and I like to appreciate the work, even if it's short. But I don't have time to go to the art gallery."
4718,79,1,30,ISTJ,38,"<no>  It's not difficult to understand. But if you're not a close friend, you won't care much."
4719,79,1,30,ISTJ,39,"<no> Planning daily tasks is too tiring for me. You can plan according to need, but usually there are many cases where you suddenly have something to do that day."
4720,79,1,30,ISTJ,40,"<neutrality>  It depends. I was very anxious when I was young because I thought I couldn¡¯t afford it, but as I became an adult and gained experience, I think I can afford it."
4721,79,1,30,ISTJ,41,"<Yes> It's not easy to end the phone with someone you're close with. I don't like getting the feeling that the other person wants to make a long phone call, and texting is more comfortable than a voice that reveals emotions."
4722,79,1,30,ISTJ,42,"<no>  Rather than taking the time to understand other opinions, acknowledge that they are different and move on. No such experience."
4723,79,1,30,ISTJ,43,"<neutrality>  It depends. If you see a friend having a hard time, contact them first, but usually respond to calls."
4724,79,1,30,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  I don't like to miss a lot of time, so if I have a plan, I tend to stick to it as much as possible. If there is a setback, I tried to go back as much as possible. I made a plan to go to work earlier than usual in the morning, but my child was late, so the departure time was a lot off. The bus was also not on time, so I moved to a quicker route that I could walk to, so I was able to get to work on time."
4725,79,1,30,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  When I see a related object or situation, I often think of it. I think it's because it's strong in my memory. It's always like that these days rather than thinking it's because of something."
4726,79,1,30,ISTJ,46,<Yes>  My head hurts when I think deeply. The way you live matters and you don't have enough time to think deeply.
4727,79,1,30,ISTJ,47,<no> It's not about being swayed. I think the same way around me. I am not easily agitated because I have a lot of experience.
4728,79,1,30,ISTJ,48,"<no>  If you think it's unfair, you don't think about the other person's face. Because I think I am a victim too."
4741,80,0,30,INTP,1,<no>  I don't make friends regularly. The reason is that they tend to be shy.
4742,80,0,30,INTP,2,<Yes>  I like to try things. The reason is because they have a lot of curiosity and a lot of curiosity.
4743,80,0,30,INTP,3,<Yes>  I tend to cry easily when I see other people crying or see sad situations on TV.
4744,80,0,30,INTP,4,<no>  I don't really plan ahead or anything like that. The reason for this is that there are not many things that can be done the same way.
4745,80,0,30,INTP,5,"<Yes> After experiencing unfair things, relationships with people, and going through many things, I thought that just worrying won't solve things, so I'm not very shaken."
4746,80,0,30,INTP,6,"<Yes>  It depends on the situation, but most of them talk to people they know in advance."
4747,80,0,30,INTP,7,"<Yes>  I tend to try to handle almost every single thing I can. Because if you do this or that, there are times when it doesn't work either."
4748,80,0,30,INTP,8,<Yes>  I tend to immerse myself well in any situation or whatever I see. So it seems there are quite a few times when I become sentimental.
4749,80,0,30,INTP,9,"<no>  In the past, I tried writing a diary, writing a diary, and making a schedule, but in fact, there are many times when it doesn't work."
4750,80,0,30,INTP,10,"<no>  think that each person is different, and that there can be times like this and that, so I don't doubt my ability so much whenever I make a mistake."
4751,80,0,30,INTP,11,"<Yes>  Although there are parts of me that are shy, if there is someone I am interested in, I do not find it difficult to approach them first."
4752,80,0,30,INTP,12,"<no>  Since I have a lot of interest in works of art or entertainment, such discussions are good and not boring."
4753,80,0,30,INTP,13,"<neutrality> Depending on the situation, I tend to change it often. There are times when they are emotional and there are times when they try to follow reason."
4754,80,0,30,INTP,14,"<Yes>  It seems to be a bit spontaneous at times. Even if you make a special plan, every day is different, so there are many times when you do whatever you want."
4755,80,0,30,INTP,15,"<neutrality>  I try not to pay much attention to people's gaze, but of course there are times when I care."
4756,80,0,30,INTP,16,"<neutrality> It varies from time to time. I enjoy gatherings with people I like, but I'm a little reluctant to meet awkwardly or for the first time."
4757,80,0,30,INTP,17,"<neutrality>  There are movies that are fun when they are expected, and there are movies that are fun when there is a twist, so it varies from time to time."
4758,80,0,30,INTP,18,"<neutrality>  If it's really necessary for me, I want my success. But if there is someone who needs it more than me, I can rejoice in its success."
4759,80,0,30,INTP,19,"<no>  have a lot of curiosity and want to try this and that, but it seems that there are more times when I am bothered."
4760,80,0,30,INTP,20,"<neutrality>  Worrying doesn't make the worry go away, so I try not to, but the more I try not to, the more I worry."
4761,80,0,30,INTP,21,<no>  It is not burdensome because I have experienced a lot of leadership positions in various teams and meetings.
4762,80,0,30,INTP,22,"<no>  Since I have been performing on stage for a long time, I do not think that I do not have artistic inclinations."
4763,80,0,30,INTP,23,"<neutrality>  Reason is important, but without emotions, it would be too desolate and not human."
4764,80,0,30,INTP,24,"<neutrality>  There are times when I feel comfortable, but there are also times when I just want to rest because it's annoying."
4765,80,0,30,INTP,25,<no>  I don't like people's arguments. I don't like fighting over who's right and who's wrong.
4766,80,0,30,INTP,26,<neutrality>  It's different when you need attention because you want attention and there are times when you really want to hide.
4767,80,0,30,INTP,27,"<neutrality>  It really depends on the situation. Emotions change easily, but there are times when they are too dull."
4768,80,0,30,INTP,28,"<no>  I don't think it's particularly effective, but if you see someone like me, you'll want to help."
4769,80,0,30,INTP,29,"<neutrality>  There are some things that you have to finish quickly to put your mind at ease, but other things that don't bother you for a really long time."
4770,80,0,30,INTP,30,"<Yes>  always think a lot about the afterlife. I'm curious, but it's because I believe in the afterlife."
4771,80,0,30,INTP,31,"<neutrality>  There are times when I am comfortable alone, but there are also times when I am lonely, so it depends on the time."
4772,80,0,30,INTP,32,"<neutrality>  Subjects vary depending on something. It's always good if it's a topic you're interested in, but boring if you're not."
4773,80,0,30,INTP,33,"<neutrality>  No matter how different the background of that person is, if you are polite, you can always sympathize with them, but if not, it is uncomfortable."
4774,80,0,30,INTP,34,"<neutrality>  There are times when I make a decision really quickly, but there are times when I hesitate to make a decision for too long, so it varies from time to time."
4775,80,0,30,INTP,35,"<neutrality>  I almost try not to think about it. If you think about it, it's because the decision you've already made hardly changes. But if something needs to change, it may change again."
4776,80,0,30,INTP,36,"<neutrality>  There are times when I just want to get rid of stress and have fun, but there are times when resting alone is helpful."
4777,80,0,30,INTP,37,"<Yes>  I like it because when I look at paintings or works, my thoughts disappear and I can concentrate."
4778,80,0,30,INTP,38,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I understand, but sometimes I don't. Because each person can think differently."
4779,80,0,30,INTP,39,"<no>  I don't plan anything special every day. There are many repetitive routines, but that's why I don't want to plan more."
4780,80,0,30,INTP,40,"<neutrality> Try not to feel insecure. But the more I think about it, the more it seems to be so. So I try not to think."
4781,80,0,30,INTP,41,"<neutrality>  Sometimes a phone call is comforting, but other times it's inconvenient or boring."
4782,80,0,30,INTP,42,"<neutrality>  I tend to try to understand, but when I really don't understand, I think a lot, but I also try not to think."
4783,80,0,30,INTP,43,"<neutrality>  There are times when I contact him first because I'm bored, but when I'm not, I rarely do it first."
4784,80,0,30,INTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in my plan, I get flustered at first, but I tend to try to make it new by thinking that everything has a meaning and it must have a meaning."
4785,80,0,30,INTP,45,"<neutrality>  There are actions and mistakes that I really wish I hadn't done, but I tend not to think more about things that have already passed."
4786,80,0,30,INTP,46,"<no>  I often think about why I exist, what I have to live for, why I was born, and what I have to do with my life."
4787,80,0,30,INTP,47,<neutrality>  Each situation is different. I try to be as rational as possible and not be swayed by emotions. But there are times when the strings of reason are let go.
4788,80,0,30,INTP,48,"<no>  If the other person is at fault, I try to tell them without making them feel bad. If you save face for the other person's fault, you think it's not good for the other person."
4801,81,0,30,INTP,1,<no>  rarely make new friends because I don't like meeting people and prefer to stay at home.
4802,81,0,30,INTP,2,<no>  I don't do it unless it's necessary to spend time and explore personal enjoyment.
4803,81,0,30,INTP,3,"<Yes>  Thinking about how the other person would feel if it were me, we empathize with the same situation and become sad together."
4804,81,0,30,INTP,4,"<no>  In my case, I worry all the time, and I don't really think about solving those worries. Increase your own stress."
4805,81,0,30,INTP,5,"<no>  If you make a mistake or make a mistake in a high-pressure situation, your head will turn white and you will be dazed for a while. It's ambiguous to say it's recent, but when I was in college, I was asked a question during a presentation, and even if I explained it, the other person couldn't resolve it. So there were times when I couldn't think of anything."
4806,81,0,30,INTP,6,<Yes>  tend to talk only with people I know because I am reluctant to meet other people and I rarely think of wanting to talk and date a lot of people.
4807,81,0,30,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  tend to do it after completing a project completely, but when I look at the big frame, I tend to touch the small details and try to complete the big frame. In particular, when I was programming in the past, if I were to make a game, I would take a big frame for the game and make a lot of small things to complete it. I don't do anything else until I finish the game."
4808,81,0,30,INTP,8,"<Yes>  When I look at the Internet, there are many cases where I become immersed and understand things that other people cannot immerse themselves in or understand. This is the case with sad movies, animations, and games."
4809,81,0,30,INTP,9,"<no>  I don't like making plans very much. Even if you make a plan, you will continue to change your plan while you are doing it. In particular, even if you say 'Let's make a plan' with a diary or electronic tool, you can't go 3 days."
4810,81,0,30,INTP,10,"<Yes> It is called the peak of foolishness. This is the case when you think you have a lot of knowledge when you don't even know much. In my case, I thought I knew a lot, but if I don't, I think the other person's words are more correct, I doubt my knowledge or ability. You often think, 'Wasn't this?' Recently, while playing a game, I said that this is not good, but I was suspicious after hearing a rebuttal saying that I am not a friend."
4811,81,0,30,INTP,11,"<no> First of all, in my case, it is difficult to approach the other person, and conversation is even more difficult. Since you don't know what the other person's interests and likes are, it's difficult to approach them because you don't know what to say."
4812,81,0,30,INTP,12,"<no>  love the different interpretations. There is a movie called Inception as a representative, and I thought it was very interesting when a lot of stories came out about the ending of this movie. Besides that, I like to interpret and discuss the contents of games and novels in various ways."
4813,81,0,30,INTP,13,"<neutrality>  There are times when you try to follow reason but get emotional, and even in situations where you can be emotional, there are times when reason takes the lead. However, people around me seem to think that I am emotional. I've never talked about this before."
4814,81,0,30,INTP,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to be responsible for what I have to do beyond my thoughts. So, if there is something to be done, I like to plan it, but if there is nothing to do, I do what I want to do spontaneously. Typically, when I work, I don¡¯t have to do much, but I take responsibility and unconditionally do the minimum amount I thought of, and when I don¡¯t have work, I spend it doing what I want to do."
4815,81,0,30,INTP,15,"<no>  I'm always worried. As for how serious it is, if I get together with my friends when I'm not there, wouldn't these guys be gossiping about me? It's to the point where I'm worried that he might be swearing at me."
4816,81,0,30,INTP,16,"<no>  As much as I hate meeting people, I hate group activities even more. Even these days, I don't like that, so I'm looking for work that I can do at home without going out well."
4817,81,0,30,INTP,17,"<Yes>  I like being able to interpret things in my own way. I especially like to spread speculative clues called 'rice cakes'. If you spread a cartoon or novel or something like that, you spend it imagining it. So, in some novels, there are cases where you see right before the ending and don't see the ending. In the case of Harry Potter, I didn't see the ending and read the scenario before it."
4818,81,0,30,INTP,18,"<Yes>  I'm not sure why, but I like that. I especially like unsung heroes. These are people who go unnoticed, but make great sacrifices and such. As a movie, Batman feels like that. I love the tearful development of self-sacrifice."
4819,81,0,30,INTP,19,"<no> I'm stubborn, so if I stick to one of my interests, I'll just do it. For example, when reading a novel. Even recently, I fell in love with one novel, so I didn't read other novels, and I only read it without sleeping properly."
4820,81,0,30,INTP,20,"<Yes>  I haven't had much success in my life. Even when I worked, I was criticized and treated as a soldier of interest in the army. As a result, I worry that something might go wrong and that I may have done something wrong."
4821,81,0,30,INTP,21,"<Yes>  Being a leader is, of course, a position of responsibility. You have to have leadership, you have to have good interpersonal relationships, and you have the most important big responsibility, so I hate it."
4822,81,0,30,INTP,22,"<Yes>  To put it in the simplest terms, I can't draw. It's not that I don't sing or sing well. It's not that I'm good at sports either. so i don't think there is."
4823,81,0,30,INTP,23,"<Yes>  In today's world, emotions seem to be more important than reason. Every time I see that kind of emotion growing, I often think, why are those people doing that? Even though there is no profit, no development, and nothing."
4824,81,0,30,INTP,24,"<Yes> Basically, I'm lazy and rarely do housework, but if I do, I like to finish work first and rest. I'm the type to stick to work even when it's time to eat. It feels a bit like OCD."
4825,81,0,30,INTP,25,"<Yes>  Honestly, it's fun to get myself into an argument and it's fun to watch an argument. We have different opinions on a topic, and in that difference, different opinions come out, and it's fun to think about it."
4826,81,0,30,INTP,26,"<Yes>  I've always thought that nothing good would come of it. Being ordinary is the best, but being ordinary is the hardest. It's because if I stand out too much, people around me will look down on me."
4827,81,0,30,INTP,27,"<Yes> In my case, there are times when bad thoughts often come to mind. As much as I worry a lot, bad things from the past come to mind. As a representative example, while eating delicious chicken, there were times when bad memories of the past came to mind, and the appetite dropped dramatically."
4828,81,0,30,INTP,28,"<Yes>  Of course, I get annoyed when I see someone who is not as efficient as I am when I am not good at my job or I am not good at anything. Speaking from experience, when I was in the army, there was a time when I got annoyed when the other person couldn't do what I could do."
4829,81,0,30,INTP,29,"<Yes>  postpone until the end. Unless you have to do it consistently or have to do it, if you can finish it in one day or do something, you put it off until the end. Even now, there is an empty water bottle left over from drinking water on the desk, but I don't clean it up. Pile it up to some extent and remove it all at once."
4830,81,0,30,INTP,30,"<Yes> It's for a very simple reason. no one has ever seen Nobody knows and nobody knows, but I wonder if the idea of wishing there is a world after death might be really interesting."
4831,81,0,30,INTP,31,"<no>  It's good to be alone. Of course, sometimes I want to play or spend time with others, but most of the time I want to be alone. So it is today."
4832,81,0,30,INTP,32,"<no>  think the goal is caught only when there is a theory. Most simply, if the conclusion of the discussion that Newton's second law is correct comes out, many more discussions will come out because of that. That's why I think it's even more interesting."
4833,81,0,30,INTP,33,"<no>  I don't understand people from completely different backgrounds. For example, there is a thief who picks up a fallen item and thinks it is his or hers. But I don't understand. There are people who bought it with money, but I don't understand at all that it's their own."
4834,81,0,30,INTP,34,<Yes>  To decide something means to finish it. It is said that it is difficult to correct any more. That's why I put it off until the last minute to check if it's perfect.
4835,81,0,30,INTP,35,<no>  I keep thinking. no i don't You will get better even if you don't like it. I keep worrying about whether I made a mistake or if there is something wrong.
4836,81,0,30,INTP,36,"<no>  Spend time alone. I think watching internet broadcasting while eating delicious food alone is the best way to relieve blood. It's hard these days because I don't have money, but if I had it, I'd do it again."
4837,81,0,30,INTP,37,"<no> To be honest, I don't understand much about works of art. I don't know what's good and what's bad. It's just that a picture of a pretty woman is pretty, and a picture of a handsome man is handsome."
4838,81,0,30,INTP,38,"<no>  I think it's easy to understand other people's feelings. It's easy to understand once it comes out of the expression. When I'm talking about something to a friend, I look at the expression on my friend's face and figure out whether they're bored or happy, so I continue or end the conversation."
4839,81,0,30,INTP,39,"<no>  I'm completely sick of planning to the extent that it can be said to be the representative of the three days. Every day I think about what I have to do and what I am going to do, but it seems that I rarely make a plan and it doesn't go as planned."
4840,81,0,30,INTP,40,"<no>  Rather, it seems that there are more times when I feel anxious. It seems to be a natural tendency. It's been like that since ancient times and it's still like that."
4841,81,0,30,INTP,41,"<Yes>  Calling someone is too daunting. Being with people or having conversations is burdensome, but talking one-on-one over the phone is too burdensome. So these days, when you order delivery, you pay through a delivery app."
4842,81,0,30,INTP,42,"<Yes> If you have a disagreement with a friend, think about it for days and days. I think while I sleep, I think while I work. You think, 'I wish I would have said this at this time', or think about what the other person's opinion was while thinking over what the other person said."
4843,81,0,30,INTP,43,"<no>  From the old days, if there was something to meet with friends, friends contacted me first. Gathering in my house of gathering. Because I don't like to go out."
4844,81,0,30,INTP,44,"<no> If plans go wrong, I aim to change plans whenever possible. For example, if you decide to do 10 tasks today, but you only get 5, think about doing 8 and doing 12 tomorrow."
4845,81,0,30,INTP,45,"<Yes>  Very much. There's no particular reason, and it seems like it's been that way since before. Bad memories linger for a long time and keep coming back."
4846,81,0,30,INTP,46,"<no>  tend to think deeply. Watching that some people die easily and some people survive by luck, I thought deeply about whether fate exists and what the value of human existence is."
4847,81,0,30,INTP,47,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. There were times when I was angry because I was so angry over insignificant things, and there were times when I was not swayed by emotions as if it were nothing even over very important things."
4848,81,0,30,INTP,48,"<no>  I'm definitely the type to pin down the other person's fault. It's not that my personality is twisted and I enjoy that kind of thing, but because I'm the type of person who needs to be clear about what's wrong, I say clearly that your fault is all your fault."
4861,82,0,30,ESTP,1,"<neutrality> For me it depends. The reason is that new friends are made when there is a commonality such as work or meeting, and not made when leaving the job or leaving the meeting."
4862,82,0,30,ESTP,2,<Yes>  I am currently interested in real estate. The reason is that I was always interested in real estate auctions and trends.
4863,82,0,30,ESTP,3,"<no>  don't particularly want to cry. The reason is that I can read the other person's feelings of being sad or happy, but I can't easily assimilate the other person's feelings in a situation I've never experienced."
4864,82,0,30,ESTP,4,"<no>  I'm not the type to make preparations. The reason is that it is difficult to predict what situations will arise during the process when you want to derive some results. So, when a situation arises, I tend to solve it immediately."
4865,82,0,30,ESTP,5,"<Yes>  I've been thinking about my career path lately. I was under a lot of psychological pressure, of which economic pressure was the most severe. However, I have experience in making a decision after thinking rationally, with the idea that I must decide more carefully than any other worries about my career path."
4866,82,0,30,ESTP,6,"<neutrality>  tend to act differently depending on the situation. The reason is that if I am interested in or like a meeting, I introduce it first and take the initiative."
4867,82,0,30,ESTP,7,"<Yes>  I can't do both at the same time. The reason is because of my desire to meet my own standards. When I fall into one task, my concentration increases and work efficiency increases, and in the end, I consistently get good results."
4868,82,0,30,ESTP,8,<no>  I'm not sentimental. The reason is that they do not easily assimilate to the other person's emotions and always maintain a composure.
4869,82,0,30,ESTP,9,<neutrality>  I write in my diary only big events in my family or events that I shouldn't miss for business reasons. The reason is that other things are not considered important.
4870,82,0,30,ESTP,10,"<no>  don't doubt my abilities. Mistakes are made by everyone, so rather than blaming myself for mistakes, I think of them as a basis for another experience."
4871,82,0,30,ESTP,11,"<Yes>  I am easy to have a conversation with. If you're interested, focus on what the person is talking about to find common ground. On the contrary, I do not make any effort except for necessary conversations with people who are not interested."
4872,82,0,30,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in debating. The reason is the tendency to produce quick results. I think it is a waste of time to discuss the interpretation of works of art, especially without results."
4873,82,0,30,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  In general, I tend to follow reason. I judge that way too, and I get a lot of evaluations from my acquaintances that I don't act emotionally."
4874,82,0,30,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  I always improvise. When I go on a trip, the moment the other person makes a plan for the day and informs me, I feel the pressure to stick with it."
4875,82,0,30,ESTP,15,"<Yes>  I'm not worried. The reason is that my own evaluation of myself is more important than the evaluation of others. There is no reason for this thought, and it seems to be a tendency."
4876,82,0,30,ESTP,16,"<neutrality>  I enjoy participating in my favorite group activities. Usually, the subjects that are interested in change quickly. I like to do things with my close friends rather than doing things by myself, such as cycling or gym."
4877,82,0,30,ESTP,17,"<Yes>  I recently watched a movie called The Wife and the Hunt. Because it is a film with a political theme, interpretations contradicting the wife came out."
4878,82,0,30,ESTP,18,"<no>  I am satisfied with my success. The reason is because they think their success comes first rather than the success of others. It is understandable to succeed oneself and help others succeed, but it is difficult to understand the opposite case."
4879,82,0,30,ESTP,19,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the season. Recently, I am more interested in real estate and politics than in sports, so I watch the news every day."
4880,82,0,30,ESTP,20,"<no>  I'm not worried. Because there is no reason, you have to believe in yourself, and you think it's pointless to worry about things that haven't happened."
4881,82,0,30,ESTP,21,"<no>  I'm not going to do it, but if it's unavoidable, I'll accept it. Someone thinks that the group needs to be a leader, but if no one steps forward, I tend to step in and do it."
4882,82,0,30,ESTP,22,"<no>  I have strong artistic inclinations. The reason is that since childhood, I have excelled in classes and tasks that require an artistic sense."
4883,82,0,30,ESTP,23,"<Yes>  think the big move in our country is the media. When you look at the news or newspapers, people are agitated by the media with the words right-wing and left-wing. Reporters sometimes misrepresent or bias information when writing stories. As a result, people tend to be swayed by media articles rather than their beliefs, so I have the idea that it would be nice for everyone to judge rationally rather than emotionally."
4884,82,0,30,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I tend to finish first. The reason is that when you finish your housework, you can relax and feel refreshed."
4885,82,0,30,ESTP,25,<no>  I'm not having fun Because I think it's unnecessary to see other people's arguments. I am not interested in other people's business unless it directly harms me.
4886,82,0,30,ESTP,26,"<no>  I'm not particularly concerned. I think it's because I care about other people's evaluations and thoughts, but I think it's mentally harmless to naturally show my true self."
4887,82,0,30,ESTP,27,"<no>  I don't have a lot of emotional ups and downs. People around me have often seen their emotions change quickly depending on the environment or situation they are in, but I tend to respond more calmly when that happens."
4888,82,0,30,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  I tend to be irritable. Because I am an active person. I tend to find things to do and do them, but when I see people who have to passively tell me to move, I get frustrated and annoyed."
4889,82,0,30,ESTP,29,"<no>  I have never procrastinated in my life. There will be no past, present, or future."
4890,82,0,30,ESTP,30,<no>  I'm not interested. The reason is that I don't believe in the afterlife itself. We believe that all life ends when we die.
4891,82,0,30,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  The time for me to rest and the time for cultural life are different. As mentioned earlier, rest, cultural life, and work are separated."
4892,82,0,30,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  I think experience is more important than theory. Due to the nature of my job, I receive periodic training, but I don't think theory plays a big role."
4893,82,0,30,ESTP,33,"<Yes>  I don't date people based on their background. The reason is rather than the background, I tend to see if the person's inclination suits me."
4894,82,0,30,ESTP,34,<no>  tend to make decisions quickly. I don't think that putting off a decision until the end will change the outcome.
4895,82,0,30,ESTP,35,<Yes>  I'm not giving it a second thought. The reason is because you know you will make that decision even on second thought.
4896,82,0,30,ESTP,36,"<neutrality>  For me it depends. These days, I need a break, so I usually spend time alone."
4897,82,0,30,ESTP,37,"<no>  don't like it. The reason is that I don't want to grasp the thoughts of the artist, especially while appreciating the artwork."
4898,82,0,30,ESTP,38,"<no>  I never have a hard time understanding emotions. I understand the other person's feelings, but I don't assimilate them."
4899,82,0,30,ESTP,39,<no>  I like to improvise. It's because it's rare to have a plan.
4900,82,0,30,ESTP,40,"<Yes>  don't feel insecure. I don't feel insecure, perhaps because I've been taught to do things on my own since I was young."
4901,82,0,30,ESTP,41,<no>  I think it's easier to understand each other's feelings if you talk to the other person over the phone rather than through text messages and KakaoTalk.
4902,82,0,30,ESTP,42,"<neutrality>  I'm different on a case by case basis. If it's a logical opinion, we'll try to understand it, but if it's not logical, we won't take the time."
4903,82,0,30,ESTP,43,<Yes>  tend to contact my close friends or friends whom I have lost contact with first and ask them to meet.
4904,82,0,30,ESTP,44,"<no>  Rather than going back, I tend to look for alternatives in the current situation. There has been no similar situation lately."
4905,82,0,30,ESTP,45,"<no>  I have no regrets. Because if you go back to that situation, you will make the same mistake."
4906,82,0,30,ESTP,46,<Yes>  I don't think deeply. Because thinking about the subject is meaningless.
4907,82,0,30,ESTP,47,"<no>  I am good at controlling my emotions. Even if I think about it, people around me ask why I didn't get angry at the situation, but I answer that I didn't get angry because I wasn't angry."
4908,82,0,30,ESTP,48,"<no>  I am very clear about my faults. Even close friends and family members do not think of exceptions. From a neutral standpoint, the wrongs are covered. The reason is because I think it's for that person."
4921,83,1,40,INTJ,1,"<no>  For now, it's more important to spend time with my existing friends and spend my leisure time."
4922,83,1,40,INTJ,2,"<Yes>  To prepare for old age, I read a lot of books related to investment and asset growth, and I spend a lot of time doing yoga and jogging for health."
4923,83,1,40,INTJ,3,"<no>  When I see someone else crying, I think why is that person crying rather than wanting to cry with them? Think of ways to address the cause of your crying."
4924,83,1,40,INTJ,4,"<neutrality>  I think about various outcomes before starting work, but when things go wrong, I deal with them according to the situation."
4925,83,1,40,INTJ,5,<neutrality>  I am constantly trying to keep my composure. I don't like to show others that I'm shaking. Don't create situations where you'll feel pressured as you get older.
4926,83,1,40,INTJ,6,"<neutrality> Depending on the situation, if you need me, I'll introduce myself first and approach you, but if it's a fun party, I tend to spend it with close acquaintances."
4927,83,1,40,INTJ,7,<neutrality>  A new project comes in while the project is in progress. There was a time when I was torn between two projects and couldn't finish the job properly.
4928,83,1,40,INTJ,8,"<no>  When I get emotionally charged, I take a step back and look at the situation. Rather than confronting the child emotionally, he tends to avoid the seat."
4929,83,1,40,INTJ,9,<Yes>  I like to organize things beautifully in a paper diary. I also like to write on my calendar.
4930,83,1,40,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  When I was conducting a class with students, I suddenly couldn't think of it, but after class, I felt that I lacked ability to prepare for class perfectly."
4931,83,1,40,INTJ,11,"<Yes> When I have a conversation with someone I'm interested in, it's possible to do it comfortably because I'm the type to talk and listen a lot according to the conversation topic the person wants."
4932,83,1,40,INTJ,12,<no>  I am not interested in art and like to see other people's opinions.
4933,83,1,40,INTJ,13,<Yes>  I try to do things rationally rather than emotionally. The reason is that responding emotionally makes it difficult to understand the other person well.
4934,83,1,40,INTJ,14,"<neutrality> It's good to know things are going according to plan. However, when impromptu happens, we rationalize it for good reasons."
4935,83,1,40,INTJ,15,"<neutrality>  I don't really care how I look to others. However, I tend to care about other people's evaluations in public settings."
4936,83,1,40,INTJ,16,<Yes>  I like the energy and bright energy that I feel when many people come together and work together.
4937,83,1,40,INTJ,17,"<neutrality>  don't like to decide the ending myself. If it goes the way I want it, I think the fun will be reduced."
4938,83,1,40,INTJ,18,"<no>  I am not interested in the success of others. If successful, congratulations, but less direct help."
4939,83,1,40,INTJ,19,<no>  I tend to focus more on familiar interests rather than starting something new. The reason is that I want to do familiar things better than challenges as I get older.
4940,83,1,40,INTJ,20,<Yes>  I tend to worry. The reason is that I often think about whether this is the best thing until a successful outcome comes out.
4941,83,1,40,INTJ,21,"<neutrality>  I used to accept it if I had to, but these days I tend to decline it. The reason is that I need more time."
4942,83,1,40,INTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I'm not without artistic inclinations, but they don't express themselves well. The reason is that the way to express what you think is immature."
4943,83,1,40,INTJ,23,<Yes>  I think so. The reason is that emotions are harder to control than reason.
4944,83,1,40,INTJ,24,"<no>  I take a break without finishing my chores. The reason is that when my body is tired and exhausted, I have to rest right away to be active."
4945,83,1,40,INTJ,25,"<Yes>  enjoy seeing other people's arguments. The reason is that it's fun to see each person talking about their thoughts, expressing their feelings, and trying to convince the other person."
4946,83,1,40,INTJ,26,<Yes>  I tend not to draw attention to others. Because people take on tiring work when the eyes are on them.
4947,83,1,40,INTJ,27,<neutrality>  I'm not the type to sink quickly. The reason is that we need time to take a step back and look at the situation in order to control our emotions.
4948,83,1,40,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  I tend to get annoyed with people who aren't efficient. Because there is a little comfortable and effective method, but it's annoying to see that you don't try it even if you explain it."
4949,83,1,40,INTJ,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to procrastinate a bit. Because if you lose interest in what you have to do right now, you will pay attention to other things, and you will make a legitimate reason for what you are doing and postpone it little by little."
4950,83,1,40,INTJ,30,"<Yes>  I think the afterlife is very interesting. Because, apart from the existence of the afterlife, people are interested in talking about, documenting, and believing in the existence of the afterlife itself."
4951,83,1,40,INTJ,31,"<no>  I don't enjoy interacting. The reason is that as I get older, I realize that spending time alone is so comfortable and good."
4952,83,1,40,INTJ,32,<Yes>  I think theory-centered discussions and principle-centered stories are boring. The reason is that the story is boring.
4953,83,1,40,INTJ,33,"<neutrality>  I tend to sympathize. The reason is that when you look at a person, you can feel the environment in which he has lived to some extent. And while talking about it, you may feel envy or regret, but you can understand it."
4954,83,1,40,INTJ,34,<Yes>  tend to procrastinate making decisions. Reason tends to think there is a good way to the end.
4955,83,1,40,INTJ,35,"<Yes>  When I make a decision, I try not to think about it. The reason is that in the process of making a decision, you are tired because you have already thought and agonized too much."
4956,83,1,40,INTJ,36,"<no>  I prefer spending time alone rather than partying. The reason is that after a party, my body is tired, so I choose to rest quietly by myself."
4957,83,1,40,INTJ,37,"<no>  I don't often go to art galleries or art activities. The reason is that it is not a field of high interest, so if you procrastinate, you will not have time."
4958,83,1,40,INTJ,38,<no>  I am good at understanding other people's feelings. The reason is that he has a habit of always paying attention to the people around him.
4959,83,1,40,INTJ,39,"<neutrality>  am happy when I stick to a set schedule. So if you have a daily to-do checklist, you're more efficient."
4960,83,1,40,INTJ,40,"<neutrality>  I often feel insecure. However, I tend to find composure quickly by trying hard."
4961,83,1,40,INTJ,41,"<neutrality>  I don't feel uncomfortable talking on the phone, but I usually don't call first unless there's something special. The reason is that the phone calls talk too much nonsense."
4962,83,1,40,INTJ,42,"<no>  I don't spend a lot of time. The reason is that even if opinions differ from mine, I tend to acknowledge and accept them as long as they are correct."
4963,83,1,40,INTJ,43,<no>  I'm not the type to contact my friends first. The reason is a habit from childhood.
4964,83,1,40,INTJ,44,"<neutrality>  will first think about the reason why the plan was disrupted and make a decision. The reason is that if there is something more important than the plan, you should do more important things first."
4965,83,1,40,INTJ,45,"<Yes>  I have regretted my mistakes long ago. The reason is that I made mistakes while handling things before my emotions in childhood, and it affects me even when I get older."
4966,83,1,40,INTJ,46,"<neutrality>  tend not to think deeply. The reason is that since you have already been born, you just have to live faithfully. I'm trying to live a hard life without considering the essential reason."
4967,83,1,40,INTJ,47,"<no>  I'm not the type to be swayed by emotions. Reason is, when I feel emotionally upset or something changes, I try to step back and look at the situation."
4968,83,1,40,INTJ,48,"<neutrality>  I tend to make an effort. Considering the other person's situation and relationship, I try to protect the other person's face on the spot."
4981,84,1,40,ENFP,1,"<Yes>  When you live a social life, you naturally make friends. And as I expand to be friends of friends, I think I have no choice but to meet new friends."
4982,84,1,40,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  I don¡¯t like time to be idle, so I tend to do this or that, whether active or not. These days, I'm into badminton, and I'm playing it for 2-3 hours every day."
4983,84,1,40,ENFP,3,"<Yes>  yes. Even if I try not to, my emotions transfer quickly, so I often cry along with it. Even while watching a broadcast, it is automatic when I see the tears of someone who is psychologically close to me."
4984,84,1,40,ENFP,4,"<no> It's not like that. If things go wrong, I think I tend to look for ways from then on. However, if something goes wrong, a big problem arises."
4985,84,1,40,ENFP,5,"<neutrality>  Normally, I tend to have a lot of emotional ups and downs, but I tend to keep my composure in situations where there is a lot of pressure. And when work is over, I think I¡¯m the type to pour out the various emotions I¡¯ve been holding back."
4986,84,1,40,ENFP,6,"<Yes>  First of all, I tend to talk to people I already know. And when I get used to the situation, I think I tend to increase the number of people I know one by one. I guess it's because I prefer to increase the number of people I know one by one rather than getting to know many people at the same time."
4987,84,1,40,ENFP,7,"<no> It's not like that. While working on multiple projects at the same time, I like to select and proceed with the appropriate project according to the condition and time of the day."
4988,84,1,40,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  I have severe emotional ups and downs, and I tend to laugh more and cry more than anyone else. There is even a program that makes me cry every week while watching it."
4989,84,1,40,ENFP,9,"<neutrality>  I want to keep writing a diary, but it tends to end in January or February. I'm not a planner, but I tend to write down my shopping list and important to-dos for the day."
4990,84,1,40,ENFP,10,"<no>  Mistakes are mistakes, but I don't tend to overthink them. There are times when I blame myself for making mistakes, but I don't think it comes from a lack of ability or knowledge."
4991,84,1,40,ENFP,11,"<Yes>  feel comfortable in one-on-one situations and tend to lead conversations well. Usually, if there is a person I want to get close to for a first impression, I tend to show constant interest, such as asking a lot of questions, and most of them seem to have a good relationship."
4992,84,1,40,ENFP,12,"<Yes>  Even when I go on a trip, I tend to just enjoy my daily life rather than appreciate historical sites. I'm curious about the different interpretations, but I don't think it's just a matter of discussion."
4993,84,1,40,ENFP,13,"<no>  I want to follow reason, but emotion always wins over reason. Because emotions come like a storm and only after they pass, reason comes back. I think it was worse when I was younger, and I think I had a lot of experience receiving related advice from people around me."
4994,84,1,40,ENFP,14,"<Yes> The schedule for the day is set like most social people do, but other than that, appointments and meals are decided spontaneously according to mood and physical condition."
4995,84,1,40,ENFP,15,"<neutrality>  I don't care about the opinions of people I don't care about or like. However, I tend to pay a lot of attention to the evaluations of people I like or are interested in, so sometimes it is uncomfortable. When I was young, I wanted to be evaluated as a good person, so I was worried about everyone's evaluation, but as I get older, I feel a lot more comfortable."
4996,84,1,40,ENFP,16,"<neutrality>  It's not an environment where I do a lot of group activities, but I tend to do a lot of small-scale activities, but recently I fell in love with badminton and joined a club, so I've been working hard on group activities."
4997,84,1,40,ENFP,17,"<neutrality>  To me, the way the story unfolds is important, and I don't think the movie or book is divided into likes or dislikes depending on the ending. That's why I remember the little middle stories well, but I often forget the ending itself."
4998,84,1,40,ENFP,18,"<neutrality>  Neither. The word success itself doesn't mean much to me. I like the word happiness or together. Rather than helping someone succeed, I think I'll feel great satisfaction if I'm helping someone else's happiness."
4999,84,1,40,ENFP,19,"<no> It's not like that. I have a lot of interests, but the order of my main interests is intuitively determined, so I'm not worried about what to do, but I'm worried that important things will fall behind on my main interests."
5000,84,1,40,ENFP,20,"<no>  I'm not that worried about it. Even if things go wrong, I think there is another way out and I don't feel stressed out."
5001,84,1,40,ENFP,21,"<Yes> It's one of the things I want to avoid. I don't like to feel a lot of responsibility, and being a leader requires a lot of patience, but I just like member 1 who doesn't have to worry about that."
5002,84,1,40,ENFP,22,<Yes>  I don't think I have a strong point in the field of art where I don't think there are many observations or inquisitive minds other than human emotions.
5003,84,1,40,ENFP,23,"<no> If there was reason, there would be no forgiveness, and if there was no love and desire for humans, there would be no development. After all, both seem to be an indispensable and important part of human beings."
5004,84,1,40,ENFP,24,"<no>  After returning home, if I have stamina, I do housework first, and if I am tired, I take a break first. Even if you don't do it right away, there's no reason to stress yourself or your family over something that's okay."
5005,84,1,40,ENFP,25,"<neutrality>  like non-serious arguments. Debating on useless topics such as pouring sweet and sour pork sauce or dipping it is fun, but other debates are heavy and uncomfortable, so I can't enjoy it, but I think it's necessary."
5006,84,1,40,ENFP,26,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to enjoy getting a lot of attention at once, but I'm not the type to avoid drawing attention either. The part I want to reveal, such as fashion, rather enjoys the gaze."
5007,84,1,40,ENFP,27,"<Yes>  We go through many emotions throughout the day. Sometimes we cry and then we laugh, and then we laugh and then we get angry. But I think it's not a matter of whether emotions are diverse or not, but how much you express them."
5008,84,1,40,ENFP,28,"<Yes>  It's a style that makes decisions intuitively and doesn't regret it, so it's often frustrating to see someone who thinks for a long time or makes a slow decision. This is especially true when you see people who worry about problems that can be considered while doing it, but are unable to proceed."
5009,84,1,40,ENFP,29,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to procrastinate because I'm impatient. However, in the case of tasks that are of low importance or of little interest but need to be done, we may delay them until near the deadline."
5010,84,1,40,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  It is one of the frequently imagined subjects. Whether there is an evaluation of this life, whether there is reincarnation, and whether the soul really leaves the body and sees it when it dies, I tend to actually imagine all kinds of afterlife that have appeared in the media. Whether there is an afterlife or not, might attitudes toward this life change in either case?"
5011,84,1,40,ENFP,31,"<neutrality>  I like both. The time you spend with others is as meaningful as the time you are alone. Regardless of that, the time I don't like is time to do nothing."
5012,84,1,40,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  It's a job that requires a knowledge base, but I don't seem to enjoy it because I tend to only build knowledge that is shallow and various common sense rather than that kind of knowledge."
5013,84,1,40,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  Even if the background is different anyway, it is not difficult to sympathize with the person based on the background. Rather, I think it would be more difficult to empathize with people who have completely different thoughts in the same environment or situation."
5014,84,1,40,ENFP,34,"<no>  It's not like that. I tend to make decisions quickly and with fewer regrets. Action can be postponed, but decisions are quick."
5015,84,1,40,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to regret it, and I'm the type to think that all of my past decisions have meaning. Even when I buy a small item after thinking about it, I think my item looks the best and is a comfortable style to live in."
5016,84,1,40,ENFP,36,"<neutrality> Outside of work hours, I meet up with someone every evening to have a good time. When I'm tired, I tend to think that it's better to go out and get energy than to stay at home. However, I think it is necessary and precious time to have alone time and organize your thoughts leisurely."
5017,84,1,40,ENFP,37,"<no>  I do not like it. Even when traveling in Europe, there are more cases where you only see buildings from the outside and never enter them. I prefer to see and hear real people who are moving in a lively manner in a market place rather than a work of art."
5018,84,1,40,ENFP,38,"<no>  Emotions are more often understood. In fact, everything is understandable if you think about it from that person's point of view. However, there are more times when the behavior based on those emotions is not understood. Even if you have feelings, there are limits to how you express them."
5019,84,1,40,ENFP,39,"<neutrality> In terms of work, I tend to jot down brief notes of what I have to do every day. Work is not just for me. However, my personal schedule is flexible depending on my mood and condition."
5020,84,1,40,ENFP,40,"<no>  There are not many other concerns, but there are many concerns about safety. I think I was greatly influenced by my mother when I was young, such as locking the gas valve and locking the door several times. But it's not inconvenient to think that confirming it removes anxiety."
5021,84,1,40,ENFP,41,"<no>  Texting or writing can take a long time and can be misleading, so I prefer to quickly organize things over the phone. The only time you want to avoid it seems to be when you're giving bad news."
5022,84,1,40,ENFP,42,"<no> It's not like that. Most of the people close to me have been sorted out as I get older, so when there are only people with similar inclinations and different opinions, I tend to just go over it as if there are people like that, unless I have a special interest in it."
5023,84,1,40,ENFP,43,"<neutrality>  It seems half and half. Depending on my friends, there are some friends I contact first and vice versa. Personally, I prefer to be in touch."
5024,84,1,40,ENFP,44,"<no>  Rather than going back to the plan, making a new plan in that situation seems more appropriate to my inclination. If I make a detailed exercise plan every day and fail to do it, I tend to do it flexibly, such as reducing the number of times or changing the method."
5025,84,1,40,ENFP,45,"<neutrality> I'm not the type to regret other mistakes, but now that I think about it, I sometimes think about people who have drifted apart over trivial matters or because of slight discomfort. However, it seems that I have been organizing my thoughts that it must have been a relationship soon."
5026,84,1,40,ENFP,46,<no>  I always think about it and have conversations like that with my friends. But I don't think there has to be any profound reason for that. I just love to share my concerns about it. It's a process of finding answers to the question of how you want to live in the future.
5027,84,1,40,ENFP,47,"<Yes>  I want to control my emotions, but I tend to be swayed by them. It has improved with age, but it is still visible on the face enough to be called an invisible person. Thoughts seem to be able to have feelings come to an end."
5028,84,1,40,ENFP,48,"<no> It's not like that. If the fault is obvious, I think you should say something even if you are older or of a higher position than me. I just try to choose words and phrases that are less offensive."
5041,85,0,30,ISTP,1,"<no>  I don't particularly take the time to make friends. The reason is that I don't have time, but I don't have much interaction with my few friends, so I don't particularly try to make other friends."
5042,85,0,30,ISTP,2,"<Yes>  These days, I want to have a hobby other than the one I had, so I'm looking for a fun field through various routes. The reason is that I am tired of living the same life over and over again, so I am looking for something to revitalize myself."
5043,85,0,30,ISTP,3,"<neutrality> It seems that each situation is different. When I see someone crying about something I can relate to, I feel like I get emotional, but if I don't know the reason why the other person is crying, I'm not very upset."
5044,85,0,30,ISTP,4,"<Yes>  I don't make various countermeasures, but I tend to work while thinking about countermeasures. When I am in charge of an important task, I tend to be under a lot of pressure, so I tend to work with failures or mistakes in mind."
5045,85,0,30,ISTP,5,"<no>  It is difficult to maintain composure. There was a case where colleagues came around to watch a lot of work that had to be completed due to the company's work, but it rather interfered with further work and the work did not go well."
5046,85,0,30,ISTP,6,"<Yes>  don't like to approach new people first. I can say hello to someone I'm seeing for the first time, but I tend to get stressed out about how to lead the conversation after that."
5047,85,0,30,ISTP,7,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different depending on the situation. I tend to put a lot of energy into working on a project, so I tend to take a break after giving it a little bit of time rather than continuing immediately."
5048,85,0,30,ISTP,8,"<neutrality>  It seems to be sentimental due to environmental factors. I'm not always sentimental, and given the environment or situation I prefer, I seem to fall into sentimentality a bit. For example, I tend to become sentimental in the fall, especially in quiet evenings or rainy weather."
5049,85,0,30,ISTP,9,"<neutrality>  We don't plan every time. I tend to make plans only for important schedules or things that interest me. For example, a travel vacation or an important appointment."
5050,85,0,30,ISTP,10,"<Yes> When I make a mistake, I tend to revisit the circumstances that led to that mistake over and over again. I haven't had a similar experience recently, but looking at the past, I've had an accident in the past to the extent of writing a police report, but there were times when I blamed myself and drank a lot."
5051,85,0,30,ISTP,11,"<no>  I'm not good at talking to people who are interested in me. I want to be nice to the person I'm interested in, but I'm wary of how to start and I'm afraid they'll judge me badly for my misbehavior."
5052,85,0,30,ISTP,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested. The reason is that I haven't found a reason to think specifically about the meaning of a work of art, especially a painting or an art film."
5053,85,0,30,ISTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to act with reason. Rather than having a special reason, I think there is a higher chance of making a mistake if you show your emotions and act, so I tend to follow reason as much as possible."
5054,85,0,30,ISTP,14,"<neutrality>  It seems to vary from case to case. In the case of an important situation, I tend to make a little plan, and I tend to improvise in things that are a little comfortable and fun."
5055,85,0,30,ISTP,15,"<Yes>  tend to care a lot about what other people think of me. In my life, there are times when someone makes a mistake, and when that happens, I tend to pay a lot of attention to what the people around me think of me."
5056,85,0,30,ISTP,16,"<neutrality>  Participation seems to depend on whether or not you like it. Since I am interested in kidult these days, I often participate in gatherings with friends who are interested in the same, but I do not participate much in sports activities and company group dinners."
5057,85,0,30,ISTP,17,<no>  I like books and movies with a fixed ending. I like movies that can be watched without thinking about good luck or evil. The best movie of the year was 'Top Gun Maverick'.
5058,85,0,30,ISTP,18,"<no>  I seem to be quite unintentionally jealous. When someone around you succeeds or achieves great results, they don't show it on the outside, but they seem to be very concerned and jealous."
5059,85,0,30,ISTP,19,"<no>  I've never thought about what to do like that. I felt helpless because my interests were not very diverse, and now I am looking at various information because I want to have various interests."
5060,85,0,30,ISTP,20,"<no>  don't worry often. I don't usually have much to worry about or care about. However, only when I am entrusted with an important task or task, I tend to worry a lot in case something goes wrong."
5061,85,0,30,ISTP,21,"<Yes>  They do not prefer leadership roles. Not only do I hate being in the spotlight, but I also feel that I lack the ability to lead others with leadership."
5062,85,0,30,ISTP,22,"<Yes>  don't think there are any at all. The reason is that I don't feel any special talent in art or song, and I think I'm a little worse than others."
5063,85,0,30,ISTP,23,"<Yes>  I think it would have been a little safer if it had been centered on reason. Emotions are also an important part, but these days, there are too many cases of harming others with only emotions at the forefront. Whenever I see things like that, I wish I could have acted with more reason."
5064,85,0,30,ISTP,24,<no>  I tend to take a break first. I tend to think of housework as something that can be put off until later. I tend to delay it as much as possible until I feel uncomfortable.
5065,85,0,30,ISTP,25,"<neutrality>  There are times when you are interested in the debate, but there are times when you think it is a little useless as to why you are arguing so far."
5066,85,0,30,ISTP,26,<Yes>  I don't like to attract the attention of others. There are times when I am speechless when several people suddenly take an interest in my conversation during a conversation.
5067,85,0,30,ISTP,27,"<neutrality>  I try to keep my emotions as close as possible. When I'm in a good mood, I tend to suppress it as much as possible and guide the tee, but sometimes I can't stand sudden anger when a specific situation that makes me angry at the moment occurs."
5068,85,0,30,ISTP,28,"<Yes>  I tend to get nervous when I see people who aren't efficient or who are disorganized. I passed on the work I did to the next junior, but if the junior didn't handle the job properly, I tend to get a little nervous."
5069,85,0,30,ISTP,29,"<neutrality> It seems that the degree of procrastination depends on the importance of the task to be done. If I don't do it right away, if there's a big problem, I'll deal with it quickly, but I tend to postpone it as long as it doesn't interfere with my daily life."
5070,85,0,30,ISTP,30,<Yes>  I am very interested in the afterlife. I tend to enjoy watching or listening to horror movies or scary stories with considerable interest.
5071,85,0,30,ISTP,31,"<Yes> I'm trying to make an appointment with a friend. The reason is that I'm getting lethargic these days, so I'm trying to broaden my interests, and I want to meet my friends and talk about various things."
5072,85,0,30,ISTP,32,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on my interests. You won't be interested in fundamental stories in fields you're not interested in at all, and you'll enjoy listening to stories about interesting topics."
5073,85,0,30,ISTP,33,"<no> It seems difficult to empathize easily. If you have a different background and environment, I think your thoughts and ideas will be different from mine. Then, obviously, different viewpoints will collide, but after saying a few words myself, I think I draw a line from people who have different thoughts from me."
5074,85,0,30,ISTP,34,"<neutrality>  If my decision has a big impact or is important, I tend to pay attention and postpone the decision until the end. But when it comes to simple things, I tend to make a decision right away and shake it off."
5075,85,0,30,ISTP,35,"<no>  Even after making a decision, I tend to think about it. I always wonder if I made the right decision, so I tend to think back a lot especially when it comes to important decisions."
5076,85,0,30,ISTP,36,"<neutrality>  I like to spend time alone, but I also like to have a drink with a few friends, if not to a party."
5077,85,0,30,ISTP,37,"<no>  I don't particularly like it. It's hard to figure out the intention of the writer, and they don't even try to find out. If it's a paid art museum, I don't think I'll go even more."
5078,85,0,30,ISTP,38,"<neutrality>  It's not a lot of hard times, but there are times when you try to understand. Instead, when acquaintances try to consult with their worries, there are times when they cannot sympathize greatly."
5079,85,0,30,ISTP,39,<no>  Making plans every day can be tiring. I don't think there will be much change if you plan in the same daily life. Planning seems to only be planned when special circumstances are given.
5080,85,0,30,ISTP,40,"<no>  You seem to have a little anxiety. I have some anxiety about getting into an accident. Because I see a lot of incidents on TV, I have anxiety about not knowing where and how accidents will happen."
5081,85,0,30,ISTP,41,"<no>  I'm not avoiding calls. Texting is very annoying, so I tend to call when I have something to contact with my acquaintances. However, I do not communicate with many acquaintances."
5082,85,0,30,ISTP,42,"<no> If it's a different opinion, I'm not trying to understand it. I think about other opinions, but I'm so agitated that I don't try to understand them. Perhaps the biggest is the political ideology. There are many cases that almost pass by listening to the conversation with someone who has a different political ideology."
5083,85,0,30,ISTP,43,"<neutrality>  There are times when I get in touch, and there are times when I call first, but usually when a friend asks to meet first, I don't go out because it's annoying."
5084,85,0,30,ISTP,44,"<Yes>  I tend to feel impatient when things don't go as planned. We try to stick to the plan as much as possible. Especially in the case of travel, each place is slightly different, but I try to go as far as possible according to the travel plan."
5085,85,0,30,ISTP,45,"<no>  tend not to keep regretting over past mistakes. If everything has already happened for that mistake and the result has come out, I don't care anymore."
5086,85,0,30,ISTP,46,"<Yes>  Eating well and living well is the reason, I don't think it exists with a special meaning. I'm not thinking about how to live my life. It seems to be living as if it just flows."
5087,85,0,30,ISTP,47,"<neutrality>  usually try to control my emotions in my daily life, but when there is something important in business, it seems that there are cases where I am unavoidably swayed by emotions."
5088,85,0,30,ISTP,48,"<no>  I tend to point out what I did wrong and say it again, and I tend to say that I hope that I don't make the same mistake twice."
5101,86,0,30,ENFP,1,"<no>  like meeting people, but at some point I thought that creating someone who can share my thoughts and feelings is something I should be careful about. I already have a lot of friends."
5102,86,0,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  I love music very much. I especially like R&B and hip-hop with EP sounds, but when I listen to music on YouTube, I listen with great concentration. I tend to look for various information through YouTube."
5103,86,0,30,ENFP,3,"<no> I've never seen a friend or acquaintance around me cry in front of me. I sometimes get sad when I listen to dramas, movies or music, but I don't think it's to the point of crying."
5104,86,0,30,ENFP,4,"<no>  Depending on the situation, I sometimes think about various variables, but I tend not to prepare accordingly. I think it's because I don't think I've ever suffered greatly in my life. As such, when I plan something, I tend to try to do it perfectly."
5105,86,0,30,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  I'm not nervous, so I don't feel any pressure or pressure about doing something in front of others or situations that focus on me. I had an important interview relatively recently, and I was completely unmoved. I didn't tremble."
5106,86,0,30,ENFP,6,"<Yes>  haven't had many opportunities to participate in parties or events, but if I take an example of gatherings with acquaintances or friends instead, I can say yes. When I meet new people, I'm not the first to approach them."
5107,86,0,30,ENFP,7,"<no>  If you are not physically and mentally overworked, you can do several things at the same time. But I tend to prioritize them."
5108,86,0,30,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  think it's because I played music when I was young, so I think I'm on the sensible side. When I watch movies or dramas, I sometimes get agitated by those emotions in sad scenes."
5109,86,0,30,ENFP,9,<no>  I'm not a planner. I think it's the style of just doing my best in situations or things that happen.
5110,86,0,30,ENFP,10,"<no>  Not at all. I think everyone can make mistakes. I tend to believe in myself, so I don¡¯t think like that."
5111,86,0,30,ENFP,11,"<Yes>  There is absolutely no pressure to talk to someone new. If I am really interested or have questions, I tend to approach them first. For example, I once asked a passer-by about the electronic product they were carrying."
5112,86,0,30,ENFP,12,"<no>  I usually like music very much and I have experience of doing music in the past. Now it's just a hobby, but there are many colleagues who had the same intentions in the past, so there is still a crew that we can listen to when new music comes out and share our thoughts about each other. It is a great pleasure to have these conversations with them."
5113,86,0,30,ENFP,13,<no>  I think I'm more inclined towards emotions. I tend to think one-dimensionally or intuitively. I think rational judgment can hurt myself sometimes. I don't want to tie myself up. I just want to do what I want to do. I hear a lot that it seems like I live freely.
5114,86,0,30,ENFP,14,"<Yes> If there is something I want to do, I have to do it so that my intuition is released. Planning something itself is boring and seems to confine daily life within certain limits."
5115,86,0,30,ENFP,15,"<no>  I'm very satisfied with my life and myself, so I've never really thought about how other people see me."
5116,86,0,30,ENFP,16,"<Yes>  As the corona is over, I have a soccer meeting with my friends once a week. If it's something I'm interested in or something I enjoy doing, I enjoy doing those activities."
5117,86,0,30,ENFP,17,"<Yes>  It's an old drama, but I really enjoyed Sang-doo, Let's Go to School and A Nice Guy, and I liked it. I recently saw it again in a clip. It's not that I'm trying to figure out the artist's intention, but I like it because it makes me think about various things."
5118,86,0,30,ENFP,18,"<no>  tend to think that myself should be the first priority in life, so I tend to put satisfaction with myself first."
5119,86,0,30,ENFP,19,"<no>  Even if I have various interests, I tend to prioritize them accordingly, so I never felt confused or difficult."
5120,86,0,30,ENFP,20,"<no>  When I'm trying to do something, I tend not to think bad thoughts. I am also the type of person who always has confidence in what I set my mind to."
5121,86,0,30,ENFP,21,"<neutrality>  Being a leader is a part where the responsibility increases considerably, so there may be some pressure, but if other people want it a lot and there is no replacement, I don't want to avoid it."
5122,86,0,30,ENFP,22,<no>  I have been interested in music since I was in middle school and have been doing music seriously until my late 20s. That's why I don't think I can say that I don't have artistic inclinations.
5123,86,0,30,ENFP,23,"<Yes>  There are many times in life when you have to make rational decisions. It's probably the same for other people. If I lived only with emotions, I think people could be more indolent and not develop."
5124,86,0,30,ENFP,24,"<no>  I think that taking a break is due to my own needs, so even if I have to do housework, I don't think it's really necessary as long as it doesn't harm others."
5125,86,0,30,ENFP,25,"<neutrality>  Unless the wording is too strong or the argument is biased towards each other's feelings, there are many things I can learn from watching, so I think it's worth watching rather than enjoying it."
5126,86,0,30,ENFP,26,"<no>  I'm not the type to notice other people, so I'm not really interested in what they think."
5127,86,0,30,ENFP,27,"<no> Not so. When one emotion arises, it tends to last a little longer, but I don¡¯t think it changes often."
5128,86,0,30,ENFP,28,"<no>  Each person has their own style and I think that we should respect that, so I don't think it's very meaningful to be inefficient."
5129,86,0,30,ENFP,29,"<no>  If I have something to do, I tend to do it first, so I don't think I've ever delayed it. These days, even if it's a hobby, I do it after finishing the work."
5130,86,0,30,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  I think everyone dreams of immortality. If the body and spirit can lead to another place, that is eternal life."
5131,86,0,30,ENFP,31,"<no>  Since the beginning of Corona, my outside activities have decreased, but as I searched for my own small satisfaction at home, I realized that this kind of life is not too bad. These days, just watching YouTube is the most fun."
5132,86,0,30,ENFP,32,"<no>  I don't think it's boring because I think discussion itself is about knowing other people's thoughts, and I think it's a good opportunity for me to learn."
5133,86,0,30,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  Even if things are different and the environment is different, I think that being a person is the same, so if the story is not limited to what I don't know well, I can sympathize with it."
5134,86,0,30,ENFP,34,<no>  I tend to make decisions as quickly as possible. I think the best answer comes when you think simply.
5135,86,0,30,ENFP,35,<Yes>  I don't really want to think about it because I think regret or lingering is something that ruins me. I'm not the type to pick up the words I spit out well.
5136,86,0,30,ENFP,36,"<no> Maybe it's because I've gotten used to living alone because of the corona, but I've been spending more time alone these days. It's kind of fun too."
5137,86,0,30,ENFP,37,"<Yes>  When a new song or the latest movie comes out, I like it enough to listen to it first or watch the movie."
5138,86,0,30,ENFP,38,<no>  Sometimes friends who have troubles come to me. That's why I think I understand them well.
5139,86,0,30,ENFP,39,"<no>  I'm the type to enjoy situations that happen in the moment, so I'm not the type to make plans. If it's not a job with a fixed end, I tend to stop when I feel a certain level of satisfaction."
5140,86,0,30,ENFP,40,<Yes>  I guess it's innate. Maybe my mother's father's inclination and home education permeated me culturally.
5141,86,0,30,ENFP,41,"<no> When I have something to do or something to say, I don't hesitate to talk on the phone. Phone calls are much more convenient than Talk and Messages."
5142,86,0,30,ENFP,42,"<no>  Oh, I think you can think like that and just pass it on. It's because people don't think everyone can think the same way."
5143,86,0,30,ENFP,43,"<no>  Even if I don't ask to meet first, there are many friends who are looking for me, so I tend to move accordingly."
5144,86,0,30,ENFP,44,"<Yes> Recently, there was a situation where I had to do something urgently, but there was a problem with my computer, so I formatted it and started working right away."
5145,86,0,30,ENFP,45,<no>  I tend to just accept it because I think that I am the same as I used to be. I don't have any memories or memories that I regret.
5146,86,0,30,ENFP,46,<Yes>  I don't think anyone was born to do something. I think the most important thing is to simply enjoy life and find satisfaction in it.
5147,86,0,30,ENFP,47,"<neutrality>  I think I¡¯m the type of person who lives freely enough to hear a lot of people say that I live without any worries. When something happens that drains your emotions, even if it's a bad thing, you can quickly restore it to your daily life."
5148,86,0,30,ENFP,48,<no>  I tend to speak straight. It's because I don't think it's necessary to protect me if it hurts me.
5161,87,0,30,INFP,1,"<no>  Since I made friends in high school and started my social life, I do not make friends unless there is a special relationship. I guess it's because I'm not particularly interested in people in general."
5162,87,0,30,INFP,2,"<Yes>  In my case, I am an office worker, so I tend to rest at home when I am tired, but on holidays, I enjoy my hobbies such as animation, watching movies, and reading novels at home. They seem to enjoy spending almost all their time exploring and exploring deeply."
5163,87,0,30,INFP,3,"<no>  First of all, when I see someone who has nothing to do with me crying, I feel sorry for that person depending on the reason for crying, but I don't think I want to cry simply by seeing that person crying."
5164,87,0,30,INFP,4,"<neutrality> As a rule, if the probability of things going wrong is high, they rarely do things themselves. However, for example, if I suddenly get cancer or get into a car accident while working on a project, and I do something that has a dangerous impact on my life, I have several plans in place in case something goes wrong. I will, but I rarely prepare for things that go wrong when I simply enjoy my hobbies or simple games, and I seem to be flexible and cope with them at that time."
5165,87,0,30,INFP,5,"<no> Personally, I feel like I can't do what I used to do well when I'm under a lot of pressure. That's why I want to be alone as much as possible, and I always take my time when I'm working and try not to overdo it slowly. I haven't been under a lot of pressure lately, but when I was young and forced to study while attending an academy I didn't want to go to, my score was actually worse than when I studied on my own. So after that, my parents seem to have left me free without any pressure."
5166,87,0,30,INFP,6,"<Yes>  Due to my inclination, I am extremely reluctant to go to any gathering that is not a party, so I don't participate in the first place, but if I do, I only talk to people I know and don't speak to anyone I don't know. Seriously, I like to meet and talk with close people 1:1, but it's extremely burdensome to introduce myself to people I don't know at large meetings."
5167,87,0,30,INFP,7,"<Yes>  Personally, I tend to be a perfectionist, so if I don't complete one project perfectly, I don't start another project. So, in the case of a project that I can't seem to complete perfectly from the beginning, I don't start in the first place. Even when I do freelance work, I tend to get one outsourcing, finish it perfectly, and then outsource to another client."
5168,87,0,30,INFP,8,"<neutrality>  When it comes to social life, we think very rationally, but when we appreciate literary and artistic works, we often feel and enjoy them emotionally rather than rationally, so we think it is neutral."
5169,87,0,30,INFP,9,"<no> For example, when I do something that requires money, I tend to make a plan to some extent, but otherwise, I tend to improvise most of the time. For example, when traveling, I tend to simply decide on a destination, such as a hotel reservation, in a big frame, and do other small things improvisedly at that time. I don't enjoy making plans other than that."
5170,87,0,30,INFP,10,"<neutrality>  don't particularly doubt my own ability, thinking that anyone can make a minor mistake, but it seems that there are many cases where I blamed my own ability if I made a mistake that I wouldn't have made if I had paid more attention in the first place."
5171,87,0,30,INFP,11,"<no>  Of course, the desire to have a conversation with someone who is interested is like a chimney, but most of them think so only inwardly, and in reality, they just watch from a distance and hope that the other person approaches them. It is very difficult to start a conversation with someone you are not familiar with."
5172,87,0,30,INFP,12,"<no>  When it comes to the art I love, I love talking to others about it. I think it's because I want to share my thoughts on how other people might have enjoyed the work differently from what I thought."
5173,87,0,30,INFP,13,"<Yes>  In general, it's like that. That doesn't mean that I don't have feelings at all, but for example, when I'm hurt by someone else, I first feel angry feelings only in my heart, and when I act in response, I first think rationally and then act calmly. But when it comes to the people I love, sometimes actions follow emotions first."
5174,87,0,30,INFP,14,"<Yes>  In my case, I have a strong mindset to enjoy the present rather than the future, and I am happy to enjoy life thinking that way even now. Of course, there are schedules and plans during social life, but I don't like them."
5175,87,0,30,INFP,15,"<Yes>  don't care much about how others see me unless it's business related. In a relationship with a person, it is difficult to consume brain energy due to emotional consumption, so people who are not in a business relationship simply do not pay attention."
5176,87,0,30,INFP,16,"<no>  I am very fond of individual activities. I still hate group activities and like to do things alone. It's not that I don't hate people, but I don't really like doing things like that."
5177,87,0,30,INFP,17,"<neutrality>  I like that writers give the reader room to interpret the ending as they wish, but I don't like works that are too vague and obscure."
5178,87,0,30,INFP,18,"<no>  I get a lot more satisfaction from my own success than from the success of others. However, helping a family member or a really close friend is satisfying."
5179,87,0,30,INFP,19,"<no>  In my case, if I spontaneously develop an interest in a particular field, I focus on that interest once and, unless I lose interest completely, I take notes that I will find out later, even if other interests arise along the way, and then I start researching the interests I have been digging into previously. I think it's because focusing on one thing suits my inclination."
5180,87,0,30,INFP,20,"<Yes>  I think it's because it's rare to be 100% perfectly sure in any case, so I always keep in mind the possibility of things going wrong."
5181,87,0,30,INFP,21,"<Yes>  I prefer to act as a staff member or support next to the leader rather than the leader. Dealing with people is difficult, and I prefer to dig into a specific field by myself and become an expert in that field to give advice."
5182,87,0,30,INFP,22,"<no>  I love singing, drawing, and theater to the extent that I enjoy them as hobbies. I go to karaoke from time to time, and I draw pictures whenever I have time. It is because we suppress our emotions and live rationally only in our daily lives, but when we enjoy artistic activities, we often put our rationality aside and enjoy being immersed in emotion."
5183,87,0,30,INFP,23,"<neutrality>  I think it's good to have order in society when reason is prioritized over sensibility in the world, but if emotions are taboo, the world will become tight and there will be little affection between people. I think it would be nice to have a society that values emotion and rationality appropriately at the right time and place."
5184,87,0,30,INFP,24,"<Yes>  Tolerably, I clean up the house and do everything I have to do before taking a break. I think it's because I want to rest comfortably in a clean environment when I take a break. Of course, if I am very tired, I will put aside the housework and take a break right away, but I tend to clean the house and take a break whenever possible."
5185,87,0,30,INFP,25,"<Yes>  I am not interested in trivial disputes, but when there is a debate related to my studies or in a field I am interested in, I tend to enjoy watching other people discuss it. I think the reason is because I feel like I'm learning because I can learn things I didn't think of, such as how the logic they argued with each other is refuted by the other person."
5186,87,0,30,INFP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to be extremely reluctant to pay attention to myself from completely different people unless I am just an acquaintance, so I try not to stand out as much as possible."
5187,87,0,30,INFP,27,"<no>  In everyday life, it is rare for emotions to change suddenly unless circumstances suddenly change. For example, it seems to be very rare for me to suddenly laugh after crying."
5188,87,0,30,INFP,28,"<Yes>  Yes, it is very irritating. In particular, I had a lot of experience in the military, but I remember being very annoyed because my senior boss insisted on doing inefficient work that consumed my stamina uselessly by following the FM."
5189,87,0,30,INFP,29,"<neutrality> If it's something that needs to be done but takes a little longer to perfect, I sometimes put it off until the deadline, but I tend to do things that can be done as quickly as possible in advance, so I chose neutral."
5190,87,0,30,INFP,30,"<Yes>  In fact, the afterlife may not actually exist, but since people cannot prove that it does not exist, it is fun to imagine that such a world could exist, so when asked such a question, I am not interested."
5191,87,0,30,INFP,31,"<neutrality>  As usual, especially when I am enjoying my hobbies, I tend to want to be alone unconditionally. But these days, it's because I'm tired from work, or when I'm lying at home right after work, I want to have a conversation with someone next to me, so I chose neutral because it doesn't seem to be the case."
5192,87,0,30,INFP,32,"<Yes>  I don't think it's meaningful to discuss science, politics, administration, etc. that are only focused on theory. I think it is reasonable to talk about the possibility and practicality when applying the theory to a different idea and practice, and it is boring to think that it is unreasonable to talk about the principle without considering it."
5193,87,0,30,INFP,33,"<neutrality>  Each person has a different background, and depending on that, their thoughts and values may be completely different, so if you think about it, you can sympathize to some extent, but almost half of people who have lived in completely different backgrounds than me I think it would be difficult to fully sympathize because you can have a humanistic view of thinking."
5194,87,0,30,INFP,34,"<Yes>  If my future destiny changes depending on the decision I make, I think I will really think carefully and postpone the decision until the end. Also, when I buy something, I tend to think carefully before purchasing, so I don't make a decision right away."
5195,87,0,30,INFP,35,"<Yes> Decisions I have already made have been carefully thought out by me, so I don't spend my brain energy rethinking them. And when you make a decision, you almost always go straight to the point where you have to do it right away, so you don't have time to think again."
5196,87,0,30,INFP,36,"<no>  I have a tendency to get rid of fatigue when I have time alone, and rather, I don't enjoy it because I lose energy when I participate in a party or event. Even today, I spend a lot of time alone."
5197,87,0,30,INFP,37,"<Yes>  I like to go to art performances, such as art galleries, theater stages, and opera stages. Of course, it's burdensome to go to places with a lot of people, but I like going to art-related places because I'm only going to enjoy art, not community like other parties or places like this."
5198,87,0,30,INFP,38,"<neutrality>  judge people's emotions by looking at their facial expressions and body language. When I judged, there are many cases where the person's feelings match, but there are many times when I don't know how women feel about dating, so I chose neutral."
5199,87,0,30,INFP,39,"<no>  When it comes to business, you make plans, but you don't enjoy them. When it comes to personal things, I prefer to just be spontaneous and flexible."
5200,87,0,30,INFP,40,"<no>  I don't know when misfortune will come suddenly, so it's not that everyday life is impossible because I always live with a prepared mind, but I always seem to have anxiety because I'm always careful. Of course, the degree will vary from time to time."
5201,87,0,30,INFP,41,"<Yes> If possible, I prefer texting, and I tend to call only when there are really business or important things. I think it's because I feel burdened by words no matter how close I am."
5202,87,0,30,INFP,42,"<neutrality>  If there is a difference of opinion during the discussion, I try to understand the other person's opinion to some extent, but if the opinion that differs from mine does not make logical sense, I do not spend time and ignore it."
5203,87,0,30,INFP,43,<no>  I rarely contact you first unless it's a really special case. I think it's because of my tendency to enjoy my hobbies first rather than relationships with people.
5204,87,0,30,INFP,44,"<neutrality> If there is a setback in the plan, first find out the cause and if it is possible to go back to the plan ad hoc, I will do so."
5205,87,0,30,INFP,45,"<Yes>  I think it was because I thought that if I hadn't made a mistake then, I would have been living a different life by now. When depression comes because of a difficult social life, it seems that I think a lot about regretting things I did not do well in the past."
5206,87,0,30,INFP,46,"<neutrality>  I thought about it a lot when I was young, but as an adult and working, I don't think I think about it much because I'm tired. However, when I see the global environment getting worse due to people, I sometimes think deeply about human existence, so I chose neutral."
5207,87,0,30,INFP,47,"<Yes>  When I was younger, I tended to be swayed by my emotions, but as I grew up and started a social life, I was used to suppressing my emotions a lot, so I don't seem to be swayed by emotions unless it's a really extreme situation."
5208,87,0,30,INFP,48,"<neutrality> If the other party's mistake is obvious, if it's a person you'll never see again in the future, openly point it out, but if you're a person you'll keep seeing each other in the future, choose neutral because you seem to go over to save face if it's not a big deal in order to avoid being consumed by each other's emotions. I did."
5221,88,1,40,ISFP,1,<no>  I hate being in an awkward atmosphere with people I don't know. I like meeting old friends in a familiar atmosphere.
5222,88,1,40,ISFP,2,"<<neutral> Recently, I am interested in a side job, so I am studying while listening to lectures and watching YouTube on how to make money through blogging. However, I worked hard in the early days, but now my interest is waning, so I am taking a lecture once every few days."
5223,88,1,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  If someone cries, I try to cry even if I don't agree with them. Tears come out when a friend cries, and even in dramas and movies, tears come out when watching sad scenes."
5224,88,1,40,ISFP,4,"<no>  worry about the future, but I don't know what to do, so I just worry and don't make preparations."
5225,88,1,40,ISFP,5,"<neutrality>  I'm under a lot of psychological pressure, but I don't show it at all. I don't want to show others that I'm nervous or anxious, so I pretend to be calm, but there are times when I'm nervous enough to collapse."
5226,88,1,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  don't like being nervous in awkward or new environments, and I don't like people I don't know about me, so I tend to talk only with people I already know."
5227,88,1,40,ISFP,7,"<neutrality>  I try to finish one project, but if it doesn't work out, there are cases where I start another project to relieve fatigue and then do the original project again."
5228,88,1,40,ISFP,8,"<neutrality> Even if it's sentimental, I tend to come back to reality right away. Even if I have fun talking about memories, I quickly return to reality, and even when I think about an interesting future, my emotions come back to reality right away."
5229,88,1,40,ISFP,9,"<no>  I'm not the best at making plans. Even when I go on a trip, my friends follow along as planned and I don't get involved in the schedule or have any complaints. If I set a schedule, I do not do it except when there is an external assignment or submission request."
5230,88,1,40,ISFP,10,"<Yes>  When I'm talking with my friends on KakaoTalk and the spelling is correct, sometimes the letters look awkward, so I try to check the spelling or find a typo in a text that has already been spoken."
5231,88,1,40,ISFP,11,"<no>  Few people are interested and rarely talk first. When you enter a new job and don't know anyone at all, there are cases where you unexpectedly actively talk to me first and try to get close."
5232,88,1,40,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  I don't know much about art, so I can't talk about it, and I'm not interested. However, I want to draw pictures myself and have the will to create something."
5233,88,1,40,ISFP,13,"<Yes>  I always think about whether it is the right decision to make a rational decision. Even if all of my friends are swept away by the atmosphere of a limited edition and buy it, there are many cases where I am the only one who doesn¡¯t buy it if I don¡¯t need it."
5234,88,1,40,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  I rarely plan my day's itinerary. If it's a limited-time job, I sometimes write it down because I'm afraid I'll forget it, but if not, most of the time I'll go out to eat spontaneously, and if the weather is nice, I'll put off what I need to do today until tomorrow and go shopping."
5235,88,1,40,ISFP,15,"<Yes>  think he has a lot of prejudice and qualifications, but he seems to be trying to appear moral and wise to others. But at the same time, I also have a desire to be seen as a cool-headed and cold-hearted person, so I think I worry a lot when I see things like this."
5236,88,1,40,ISFP,16,"<no>  When I was young, I liked group activities, so I went to church and went to reunions, but after working at the company, I didn¡¯t do it because I was tired of having to match the atmosphere rather than the pleasure of group activities."
5237,88,1,40,ISFP,17,"<no> As for the ending, I always like happy endings. Open endings or sad endings make me uncomfortable and uncomfortable because I feel like I haven't read the book or movie to the end."
5238,88,1,40,ISFP,18,"<Yes>  I think so. Even though tomorrow is urgent, if my family or acquaintances say they are in a hurry, I want to postpone my work and help them, and I feel good after helping them. I'm not sure if it's because I want to be seen as a good person by others or if it's a responsibility."
5239,88,1,40,ISFP,19,"<Yes>  have severe indecisiveness, so it's great when someone decides for me. I am interested in a side job, so I applied for a paid lecture, but I thought for too long about what to pay for, such as stocks, blogs, and coins."
5240,88,1,40,ISFP,20,"<Yes>  always worried I submitted documents by e-mail to apply for something, but there are cases where the e-mail address is correct, but they say that they did not receive it."
5241,88,1,40,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  I hate being noticed by others. I don't like talking about me, and it's a burden to ask or give instructions to others."
5242,88,1,40,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  When I was young, I was told that I was good at drawing, sculpting, and dexterous with my hands, but I don't think I have any creativity. I'm good at reporting, but I don't think I have artistic inclination because I can't imagine and create."
5243,88,1,40,ISFP,23,"<neutrality> If there are too rational people, the world will be overflowing with rules and regulations, so I think it would be better to be in a proper way. I heard an announcement telling me not to sit in the maternity seat on the subway as if someone had reported it. The person sitting could have been ill, or there could have been a valid reason, but I was a little afraid that we were becoming a desolate society where only morality and rules were required, not trying to understand each other."
5244,88,1,40,ISFP,24,<no>  I think I can do housework more comfortably if I take a break first and get rid of fatigue.
5245,88,1,40,ISFP,25,"<no>  need to argue, but I'm anxious to see it. It's good when it ends in an appropriate argument, but I think I'm worried that it will develop into a fight."
5246,88,1,40,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  At group activities or company meetings, it's burdensome for people I'm not close to to talk to me or show interest in me, so I don't talk to them first."
5247,88,1,40,ISFP,27,"<no>  Emotions don't change easily. I get annoyed, but I don't immediately feel better when something happy happens."
5248,88,1,40,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  It annoys me to see people stubbornly maintaining their own style when there is an easy way to do it. Even if they teach you what you can do easily once you create an Excel template once, I get annoyed when I see you repeat copying and pasting, saying that the existing method is comfortable."
5249,88,1,40,ISFP,29,"<no>  In general, it's better to do it in advance and take a break. I hate having work left to do. A friend of mine came to the office to eat and wash the dishes, but he asked me to drink coffee first and clean up at once, so I drank coffee first. But the thought that there are still dishes to wash doesn't leave my head, so I like to drink coffee comfortably after washing the dishes."
5250,88,1,40,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  I saw that there is no scientifically post-apocalyptic world, but I am interested in seeing articles and experiences related to the post-apocalyptic world."
5251,88,1,40,ISFP,31,<no>  I like being alone. I like to do what I want to see and do comfortably.
5252,88,1,40,ISFP,32,"<no>  Recently, I've been interested in science, so I'm looking for books or videos related to gravity, relativity, and quantum science."
5253,88,1,40,ISFP,33,"<no>  People who have too much background difference think they are in another dimension and try not to think about it. Even if my friends were envious of someone who earned hundreds of millions of won a year, they thought of people from other worlds than me, so they weren't interested at all."
5254,88,1,40,ISFP,34,"<Yes>  I have a decision disability, so I tend to postpone my decision as much as possible because I am worried about whether I made the best choice without regrets or whether I have any regrets."
5255,88,1,40,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  I always think after making a decision, whether it was a really good choice or what if I would have been better off with another choice."
5256,88,1,40,ISFP,36,<no>  It's more comfortable and nice to spend time alone at home and watch overdue movies.
5257,88,1,40,ISFP,37,"<no>  I don't go to art galleries because I don't know about art. I like easy-to-access music, movies and musicals."
5258,88,1,40,ISFP,38,"<no>  I think I am well versed in people's minds and emotions. During a conversation, I quickly understand why my friend answered this way and don't want to say more, so I deliberately pretend I don't know or ask and listen to what I'm worried about."
5259,88,1,40,ISFP,39,"<no>  Rather than doing work or personal things in a planned way, I like to rush ahead and finish it quickly, then take a break or do other things."
5260,88,1,40,ISFP,40,"<no>  Always anxious about the future. Rather than being born, I am always anxious that my family will get a serious illness or that there will be great financial damage because I can't afford it financially."
5261,88,1,40,ISFP,41,"<no>  Rather than having to wait for results like text messages or e-mails, it's good to hear the conclusion quickly through a phone call."
5262,88,1,40,ISFP,42,"<neutrality>  I try to listen to the end and understand what I am interested in, but I accurately say that I am not interested in areas that I am not interested in."
5263,88,1,40,ISFP,43,"<neutrality>  Close friends call to meet first if they don't ask to meet first. If you're not close, I never ask you to meet me first."
5264,88,1,40,ISFP,44,"<no> If my plan goes wrong, I tend to give up cleanly and try again. I had a restaurant appointment with my friends that I had reserved for only 3 months, but one of my friends was hospitalized and couldn't go. There were opinions to go except for the hospitalized friend and to change to another day, but I decided to cancel it first and decide again after discharge."
5265,88,1,40,ISFP,45,"<Yes>  A long time ago, when I was at the company, I made a mistake at work and even got scolded, I did it again, and I still think about it even after I left the company. I don't know if it was because I was personally hurt or if it was a sense of victimization."
5266,88,1,40,ISFP,46,"<Yes>  don't think about the reason for human existence and life. It's not my choice and will, I don't think too much."
5267,88,1,40,ISFP,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions well without being swayed by them. I don't think there is much change in emotions around you either.
5268,88,1,40,ISFP,48,"<Yes>  If the other person is infinite or embarrassing, I tend to try to overcome the situation somehow. I think I help because I think it would be too difficult if I faced such a situation."
5281,89,1,20,ESTP,1,"<neutrality>  I'm comfortable with existing friends, so I don't make them regularly. The reason is that I tend to try when I think I need a new friend out of necessity."
5282,89,1,20,ESTP,2,<no>  I'm not looking for interests. The reason is that I tend to focus on my current hobbies.
5283,89,1,20,ESTP,3,"<no>  don't cry with you. The reason is that I care a lot and I sympathize with them, but I don't accept their emotions so much that I share tears."
5284,89,1,20,ESTP,4,<no>  I'm not good at making preparations. Reasons are not good at assuming that things go wrong.
5285,89,1,20,ESTP,5,"<no>  It's very difficult for me to keep my composure. The reason is that when you receive external stress, your mental is shaken a lot."
5286,89,1,20,ESTP,6,"<neutrality>  I get along with both new people and people I already know. The reason is that a conversation with someone I already know makes me feel comfortable and relaxes, and I am very interested in making new human relationships."
5287,89,1,20,ESTP,7,"<neutrality>  I am different from time to time. The reason is that when there is a project with time to spare and a project without time to spare, we proceed accordingly."
5288,89,1,20,ESTP,8,<neutrality>  I have a hard time substituting the word sentimental for a person. The reason is that the feeling of being emotional and the form of appreciating are different.
5289,89,1,20,ESTP,9,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I make plans and sometimes I don't. The reason is that I always try to set a schedule, but in reality, I didn't keep the schedule perfectly, and it was the 3 days I decided not to use the diary."
5290,89,1,20,ESTP,10,"<Yes>  I think mistakes are also my ability. The reason is that you didn't read the guide enough before making a mistake, or you didn't cross-check, so I think it's a mistake."
5291,89,1,20,ESTP,11,"<neutrality>  I used to think it was relatively easy, but these days it feels increasingly difficult. The reason is that I feel that I am conscious of other people's eyes a lot these days."
5292,89,1,20,ESTP,12,<Yes>  I'm not very interested in the artwork itself. The reason is that they are not interested yet.
5293,89,1,20,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  I always try to think rationally. Judging from the fact that people around me often say that I am too realistic, I seem to be rational in the eyes of the people around me."
5294,89,1,20,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  Even if I have a schedule for the day, it takes a long time to complete. The reason is that when a task comes in in the middle, if it is a higher priority task, it seems to change the priority and start a new task."
5295,89,1,20,ESTP,15,"<no>  care about how others see me. Recently, as the amount of work has increased and the number of responsibilities has increased, it is natural for me to worry about the gaze of people around me."
5296,89,1,20,ESTP,16,<Yes>  I like to get together as a group and discuss the same problem. The reason is that I can get ideas for content that I hadn't even thought of.
5297,89,1,20,ESTP,17,"<no>  don't like the direction of interpretation. I was impressed by the fact that the culprit was revealed at the end through Crime City 2 recently, as I felt hollow when the result was clearly communicated."
5298,89,1,20,ESTP,18,"<no>  I value my life. The reason is that before helping others succeed, I believe that I can help others only if I succeed myself."
5299,89,1,20,ESTP,19,"<no>  think that if you have a lot of interests, it becomes poison. The reason is that there is a tendency to want to become an expert in one field, so if the work is too big, it will be dispersed and it seems to be neither one nor the other."
5300,89,1,20,ESTP,20,"<Yes>  If I am given any task, I want to do it well. The reason is that I think that I have to take full responsibility for the results of my given job, so I am very worried that I shouldn't go wrong."
5301,89,1,20,ESTP,21,"<no>  have a tendency to take initiative. The reason is that if you are not in a leadership role, you cannot easily make a sound."
5302,89,1,20,ESTP,22,"<no>  I'm not entirely without artistic inclinations. However, since the way to express it is not for viewing, but for a creative role, I think that I have an artistic tendency to think of a given task in various directions rather than doing art in exchange with others."
5303,89,1,20,ESTP,23,"<Yes>  I think there is progress only when you think rationally. The reason is that if you value your emotions, you think that when you encounter a problem, you will avoid solving the problem by focusing only on your emotions instead of looking for a way to solve it."
5304,89,1,20,ESTP,24,"<no>  finish my work first before taking a break. In the case of housework, it doesn't have to be right now, but I don't think of housework as a priority because work is something I have to do right now."
5305,89,1,20,ESTP,25,<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason seems to be unnecessary emotional consumption due to being together in that space.
5306,89,1,20,ESTP,26,"<Yes>  am a person who puts my work first. The reason is that even if I care about the attention of the public, if I focus on it, I think it could interfere with my work."
5307,89,1,20,ESTP,27,"<no>  As a rule, once I get a certain emotion, it takes a long time to change. The reason is that it is not confirmed when the end of the emotion right now is, so I tend to think about what kind of emotion will come after pleasant things and when the bad things will end, so it doesn't change easily."
5308,89,1,20,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  I usually get information from the Internet when I have a question or need. The reason is that I hate people who take up other people's time and only think about their own interests, even though I can check it through the Internet."
5309,89,1,20,ESTP,29,"<Yes> I'm not planning. The reason is that even if you check the importance of work, priorities may change when there is a sudden additional task. As a result, it is often the case that what should have been worked on first in the beginning is pushed back and done in a hurry at the end."
5310,89,1,20,ESTP,30,"<no>  I didn't think much about the afterlife. The reason is that I live a busy life in real life, so I don't think there is a need to be interested in it until after death."
5311,89,1,20,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  I used to prefer gathering with others, but now I enjoy being alone. The reason is that I learned the advantages of being able to freely spend my free time and various thoughts when I am alone. I still play better than anyone else when I meet other people, but sometimes I think it's good to be alone."
5312,89,1,20,ESTP,32,"<neutrality>  I've never felt terribly bored or interested in a discussion. The reason is that I understand the need, so I think it's necessary to share ideas through meetings, but it's not interesting or boring, and I've never thought that discussing unnecessary stories outside of work is interesting or boring."
5313,89,1,20,ESTP,33,"<no> It's hard for me to understand people who are completely different from me. Rather than prioritizing empathy for the reason, I first receive the negative feeling that it was not the case when I thought."
5314,89,1,20,ESTP,34,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I'm fast and sometimes I'm slow when it comes to making decisions. The reason is that I make decisions quickly in areas I am confident in, but in areas where I am not confident, I think carefully and make decisions because the responsibility is given to me."
5315,89,1,20,ESTP,35,"<neutrality>  I think differently depending on the outcome of the decision. The reason is that if there is an error in the result value, it is rethought to supplement the result value, but if the result value is good, it is not rethought."
5316,89,1,20,ESTP,36,"<neutrality>  relieve fatigue differently depending on the condition of the day. The reason is that when I feel good, I tend to meet friends and relax, and when I feel bad, I want to go home and rest. It's almost half and half these days."
5317,89,1,20,ESTP,37,"<no>  I don't like to appreciate art. The reason is that when you appreciate art works such as art museums and movie theaters, time passes too quickly and is inefficient."
5318,89,1,20,ESTP,38,"<no>  don't have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. The reason is that I don't show much sympathy, but I'm the type to read emotions well, so I've never had a hard time not understanding because I act wisely."
5319,89,1,20,ESTP,39,"<no>  Even if I have a plan, I don't like it because I can't keep it well. The reason is that I don't want to make a plan and lock myself in the schedule because I feel a great sense of loss when I can't do what I actually planned."
5320,89,1,20,ESTP,40,<no>  feel a lot of insecurity. The reason is that there are too many unpredictable things that have changed while I have been working for a long time.
5321,89,1,20,ESTP,41,"<Yes>  I am negative about phone calls. The reason is that I tend to organize my words and deliver them, but in the case of phone calls, I have to improvise, so I often do."
5322,89,1,20,ESTP,42,"<Yes>  sometimes hear opinions that are opposite to mine, so I try to understand. The reason is that I think my opinion is definitely correct, but other opinions can broaden my horizons and become a driving force for growth."
5323,89,1,20,ESTP,43,"<Yes>  Even when I make an appointment, I often get drunk on the same day. The reason is that when we set up a schedule in advance and made an appointment to meet, I didn't want to go out at that time, but I had to go out because I promised, so I only made an appointment on the same day in the first place."
5324,89,1,20,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  I don't split my plan into pieces, but when I break it down, I tend to work hard when something goes wrong. The reason is that I don't have a specific schedule, but I tend to make plans in large chunks, so if a problem arises, I try to solve it quickly."
5325,89,1,20,ESTP,45,"<Yes>  often regret my mistakes. The reason is that it is difficult to work these days, but since I already know what to do, it is difficult to change the job type, so I have been thinking a lot about it these days."
5326,89,1,20,ESTP,46,"<Yes>  I don't think you need to think too deeply about it. The reason is that even if you think deeply now, you don't think that the future will get better through the immediate answer."
5327,89,1,20,ESTP,47,"<neutrality> There are times when I control and there are times when I am swayed. The reason is different depending on the condition, but when it's good, I control it well, but when it's bad, I don't want to think too much, so I think it's comfortable to be swung around. People around me usually think of me as controlling."
5328,89,1,20,ESTP,48,"<no>  I point out the other person's fault. The reason is that once becomes twice and twice becomes three times, and if you don't mention it for the sake of face, you will repeat it in the future, and I think your relationship with me will eventually collapse."
5341,90,1,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  I like to keep in touch with people I have known for a long time. Old friends know me well, so I can have in-depth conversations. I think it will be a superficial relationship because I think I should only show my good side to my new friend."
5342,90,1,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  I like to explore different interests. I am interested in financial technology, a side job, writing, and I am also interested in weekend trips. I buy paper books and read them, or I read various people's writings at Kakao Brunch. Travel information is obtained through Naver blogs or YouTube. I try to balance my life by doing productive work on weekdays and traveling with my husband on weekends to meet the world."
5343,90,1,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes>  I tend to feel the other person's feelings well. When I see someone crying on TV, tears flow without my knowledge. I tend to over-immerse myself thinking about how I would feel if I were that person."
5344,90,1,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes>  think life is full of uncertainties. Sometimes things don't go the way I want them to. In that case, if you are not prepared for anything, you can suffer a bigger loss. I always think about just in case and prepare a plan B."
5345,90,1,40,INFJ,5,"<no>  When the pressure is severe, there is a lot of emotional agitation. Recently, the representative of the supplier did not give me money, so we had a fierce fight in the process of pressing. My heart was pounding and my hands were shaking. After something like that happens, I keep thinking about it for a day or two."
5346,90,1,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  In crowded places, people you know stand out first. Going over to your acquaintances, saying hello and observing the atmosphere at the event can help you relax. My acquaintances introduce me to new people, so socializing is easy."
5347,90,1,40,INFJ,7,"<Yes>  am a person who has difficulty multitasking. I have a tendency to pursue perfection, so I have to finish one thing so I can focus on other things. For example, if you have an article you are writing, you need to finish it so you can think about a new topic."
5348,90,1,40,INFJ,8,"<no>  I'm more rational than sentimental. It seems to become more like that as I get older. Sentimental things don't seem to help much in life. If you have a weak heart, it is easy to be swayed by others."
5349,90,1,40,INFJ,9,"<Yes>  I've been writing a diary since high school. I like to organize my tasks for each day, for the week, and for the month. Creating a schedule or list makes me feel better because I feel like I can control my time."
5350,90,1,40,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  I recently took the KBS Korean Proficiency Test. There was a problem that I was confused about, so I checked it out and it was wrong. I was confident in my Korean language skills, but I felt very pathetic."
5351,90,1,40,INFJ,11,"<no>  It's not easy to talk to someone you're interested in first. If the other person notices my crush, I feel like I've become Eul, so I feel intimidated. Instead, I attract people's attention by making myself shine. I try to be an attractive person so that that person wants to approach me first."
5352,90,1,40,INFJ,12,"<Yes>  I like art, but I don't have in-depth knowledge. I'm afraid that if I discuss art, my shallow knowledge will be exposed."
5353,90,1,40,INFJ,13,"<Yes>  I have an experience of making mistakes based on my emotions. Society is cold. When you follow reason as much as possible, it becomes easier to accept the consequences. People around me also say that I am thorough."
5354,90,1,40,INFJ,14,<no>  I like to plan my day. I feel bad when my schedule doesn't go as planned. I get stressed when I think about how hard the next day will be to fix my messed up schedule.
5355,90,1,40,INFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to care very much about how other people see me. I had a co-worker at my old company with whom I had a bad relationship. There was an incident where I shared sides with that colleague, but I wanted to confirm that there are more people who like me."
5356,90,1,40,INFJ,16,<no>  I like to be alone. I left the company a few months ago and am writing from home. I only go out on weekends.
5357,90,1,40,INFJ,17,<no>  I don't like open endings. I want the writer or director to have a definite ending.
5358,90,1,40,INFJ,18,"<no>  Rather than helping from behind, I want to be in the spotlight from the front. I think being successful is more meaningful and good."
5359,90,1,40,INFJ,19,"<Yes>  have a lot of interests, so I got several licenses this year alone. I obtained a financial accounting level 2 license, personnel and labor clerk license, online marketer license, data labeler license, and KBS Korean Proficiency Test 3+ grade."
5360,90,1,40,INFJ,20,"<Yes>  I worry a lot about this and that by myself. There are many areas in the world that you can't control, so you always imagine what could go wrong. I think I started to worry about whether it would be my job while watching strange incidents in dramas, movies, and documentaries."
5361,90,1,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes>  I think leaders should basically enjoy communicating with people. But when I'm with a lot of people, my energy is taken away. So I hate it because the energy to use when I'm alone is reduced."
5362,90,1,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  think you have artistic inclinations. I tend to get sympathy from a lot of people by writing online. Brunch has over 5,000 subscribers. I think writing can also have artistic inclinations."
5363,90,1,40,INFJ,23,"<Yes>  I think being rational is in line with being logical. I think if logical decision-making is made, better results will be obtained than being emotionally swayed by connections such as blood ties and geography."
5364,90,1,40,INFJ,24,<Yes> It's annoying when there's a lot of hair on the floor. I get stressed out when the dishes are piled up. Things around you need to be organized to clear your mind.
5365,90,1,40,INFJ,25,"<no>  I think debate is necessary for society to develop, but it's hard to see the process of arguing. When I watch someone quarreling, my heart becomes heavy because the uncomfortable feelings transfer to me."
5366,90,1,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes> If you get attention from others, you will be invited to various gatherings. Then I get stressed out because I spend less time alone."
5367,90,1,40,INFJ,27,"<no>  Emotions change slowly. If you fall deeply into one emotion, you become engrossed. For example, if you fight with your husband, it will take a long time to reconcile. It's awkward to suddenly go back to the past after getting angry."
5368,90,1,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes> It's frustrating to see people doing the same thing with difficulty. When I work at a store, I can finish it quickly if I handle the work according to the order, but I got annoyed when I saw that I was holding on to it for a long time."
5369,90,1,40,INFJ,29,"<no>  I make a to-do list for each day of the week, and if I have something to do tomorrow, I try to do it today. Then it feels good. Even when I was studying for an exam, I was stressed out when I crammed."
5370,90,1,40,INFJ,30,"<no>  I think this moment is the most important. The afterlife doesn't mean much to me. I think that everything will turn dark after I die. Going from being to nothing, that's all I think about the afterlife."
5371,90,1,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  like time alone. I don't make appointments more than once a week. I made two appointments last week, and the flow of the week was completely broken."
5372,90,1,40,INFJ,32,"<Yes>  I think the principled story is nothing more than tabletop theory. For example, I think it's more productive to discuss employee welfare and improving the working environment than discussing 'how to reduce the resignation rate'."
5373,90,1,40,INFJ,33,"<no>  Basically, I tend to surround myself with people who have the same texture in life as mine. There are many people around me who graduated from college and went to work. I used to run a restaurant with my brother for a while, but I couldn't communicate well with the self-employed business owners around me."
5374,90,1,40,INFJ,34,"<Yes>  am cautious when making decisions. I want to consider all the variables before making a decision, as I don't want to make a decision and then go back and forth."
5375,90,1,40,INFJ,35,<Yes>  Having made a decision means that you have already thought about it enough. I try to make the right decision from the beginning so I don't have second thoughts.
5376,90,1,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  like time alone. I look inside myself while writing, reading, and doing yoga by myself. The family got together last week for my father's 70th birthday party, but after the noisy gathering, the next day I feel very tired."
5377,90,1,40,INFJ,37,"<no>  I don't go to museums often unless I get a free ticket. Art is not a field that I know deeply, so I am not confident. But I like the act of appreciating art itself."
5378,90,1,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  I tend to understand other people's feelings. Since I was young, I have been exposed to various literary works, so I am good at empathy. I majored in psychology in college, so I am interested not only in my feelings but also in the feelings of others."
5379,90,1,40,INFJ,39,"<Yes> Planning daily to-dos is part of my life. Writing down what to do makes my day clearer. Work is natural, and I tend to organize my personal matters in detail so that nothing is missed."
5380,90,1,40,INFJ,40,"<no>  often feel insecure. Ever since I was little, I felt financial insecurity. In middle school, my father ran away from home with a huge debt, and in my early 20s, my older brother was accused of adultery under the guise of marriage by his girlfriend, so he was in jail for three months. The day the foreclosure came in because of my father's debt, I opened the door by myself. I vividly remember the horror of getting a red ticket. I often think of the scene where I met my brother at Indeokwon Detention Center. These are the things I want to keep secret from others forever."
5381,90,1,40,INFJ,41,"<Yes>  Phone calls don't go the way you want them to. If you organize what you want to say and talk through KakaoTalk, you can quickly reach the conclusion you want."
5382,90,1,40,INFJ,42,<Yes>  I've been thinking for days to understand my parents-in-law. I kept thinking about it because I was curious about what kind of stream of consciousness came to such a conclusion because my way of thinking was different.
5383,90,1,40,INFJ,43,<no>  I tend to wait for my friends to contact me. I'm not good at making things to go out first.
5384,90,1,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes> Last weekend, my husband and I decided to go on a trip to Gangneung. But I said I wouldn't go because I had a fight the day before. We talked for two hours that morning, solved it, and left before the morning passed."
5385,90,1,40,INFJ,45,"<no>  I think you can't move forward if you're stuck in the past. Forget mistakes quickly, and instead try not to make the same mistakes."
5386,90,1,40,INFJ,46,"<no>  tend to think deeply about the meaning of existence and the purpose of life. I went through a lot of puberty when I was in high school, and as a result, I chose psychology as my major in college. I was able to think deeply about what it means to be human."
5387,90,1,40,INFJ,47,"<no>  I am not swayed by emotions. Emotions are sensitive, but apart from that, I try to judge rationally. I hear people around me say that I am cold."
5388,90,1,40,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  think consideration for the other person comes back to me in the end. I will make mistakes too, and I would be grateful if you would understand rather than push me at such times."
5401,91,1,40,ENFP,1,"<Yes>  I love the process of making new friends and getting to know new people. If that person is a good person, it's even better."
5402,91,1,40,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  In my free time, I tend to do things that I like and are interested in. These days, I'm into knitting, so I'm learning on YouTube and learning on my own, but it's very fun."
5403,91,1,40,ENFP,3,<Yes>  Suddenly my heart sympathizes and tears come out. I can guess the person's mind and sometimes I wonder what it would be like if it were me. You seem to think a lot about emotions.
5404,91,1,40,ENFP,4,"<no>  It's not that there are no countermeasures, but I don't tend to think in advance that something will go wrong. When something happens, I tend to think about it and deal with it."
5405,91,1,40,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  My husband went to the United States for education, so I went to the United States alone with my child. I can't speak English, but I didn't panic and spent a month learning while having fun."
5406,91,1,40,ENFP,6,"<neutrality>  In that space, I tend to take the lead first when I have to be social because of my work, and in other situations, it's more comfortable with people I already know, so I don't spend my energy there."
5407,91,1,40,ENFP,7,"<neutrality>  I like to complete them completely, but I tend to do them together when it's too boring or given the time to do both. When I'm bored, good ideas don't come to my mind."
5408,91,1,40,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  I tend to empathize well with dramas and stories, and I tend to be too absorbed in them. I tend to cry while watching the news or articles."
5409,91,1,40,ENFP,9,"<neutrality>  I tend to actively use memos and calendars on my smartphone, but because of my forgetful nature, I try harder not to forget them. I also like to make plans."
5410,91,1,40,ENFP,10,"<no>  I think everyone can make mistakes. If you make a mistake, write a gratitude journal in the evening and be grateful that you can not make that mistake again."
5411,91,1,40,ENFP,11,"<neutrality> It's not difficult if you need to. I like meeting people, so most of the meetings are mutually satisfying."
5412,91,1,40,ENFP,12,"<no>  I have a lot of interest in art, so I tend to enjoy various interpretations and discussions, and I feel comforted just by looking at it."
5413,91,1,40,ENFP,13,"<Yes>  That's how I see myself, and I like that me better. When I was young, I think my emotions were ahead of me. The evaluations around me are similar to my thoughts."
5414,91,1,40,ENFP,14,"<neutrality>  In general terms, I like to plan the things that I have to deal with and improvise the rest. If you make too many plans, you feel stuffy."
5415,91,1,40,ENFP,15,"<no>  Don't worry. I have my own charm, and as long as there are people around me who do that, I am fine."
5416,91,1,40,ENFP,16,<Yes>  It's great to meet many people. I was rather depressed because I couldn't do activities because of Corona.
5417,91,1,40,ENFP,17,"<Yes>  I like to interpret and reason, so I like books and movies. It's no fun if the ending is obvious. That's why I liked Liberation Journal."
5418,91,1,40,ENFP,18,"<Yes>  Helping others is rewarding and self-esteem goes up. I'm pretty satisfied with it, but that's why I think I'm a wonderful person."
5419,91,1,40,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  have a lot of interests, so I do a lot of hobbies, so it seems like I can't concentrate, but I can do it without getting tired of it. I am also doing a lot of exercise."
5420,91,1,40,ENFP,20,<no>  I don't think things will go wrong. It's because there are many cases where you think that things will go well.
5421,91,1,40,ENFP,21,"<neutrality>  I prefer to help the leader get things done, but I can take on the task and do it well if given. When I play a small role in a group, I feel stuffy."
5422,91,1,40,ENFP,22,"<no>  On the contrary, I tend to have a lot of artistic tendencies. I play gayageum, I like painting, and I am very interested in culture and art."
5423,91,1,40,ENFP,23,<no>  I think the emotional side and the rational side should be in harmony. This is because there are many times when human affairs cannot be judged by reason alone.
5424,91,1,40,ENFP,24,"<no>  rest comes first Housework is important, but I tend to do what I want to do."
5425,91,1,40,ENFP,25,<neutrality>  I like to watch the debate and I like to participate. It's because it's fun to look at and figure out a phenomenon.
5426,91,1,40,ENFP,26,"<neutrality>  They don't try to draw attention on purpose, but they don't feel repulsive about being the center of attention. Rather, I rather enjoy it."
5427,91,1,40,ENFP,27,"<Yes> When I see or experience something, I tend to be shaken by my emotions, but I don't show signs. When we hear crime stories, especially involving children, our emotions suddenly surge."
5428,91,1,40,ENFP,28,"<no>  You may feel frustrated, but you are not annoyed. I think each person is different. I tend to put more effort into understanding the other person."
5429,91,1,40,ENFP,29,"<Yes>  I tend to come up with better ideas at the end. I always prepare for the class at the end, but it often results in better lectures."
5430,91,1,40,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  I'm the type of person who believes in it, so it's interesting and fun to hear such stories. It's good that there are worlds I don't know about."
5431,91,1,40,ENFP,31,"<neutrality>  I like being with people, but I really need some alone time because it consumes a lot of energy. Alone time is a time to recharge."
5432,91,1,40,ENFP,32,"<no>  It is not boring because I think the principled story should be the basis. If you listen to fun-oriented lectures, it looks light and there is nothing left."
5433,91,1,40,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  I like to imagine and observe, so I empathize with many people. No matter who I talk to, I tend to communicate well."
5434,91,1,40,ENFP,34,"<no>  I tend to think deeply and make decisions, but I don't procrastinate a lot. Even after making a decision."
5435,91,1,40,ENFP,35,<Yes>  It's a decision I made after thinking it through and I don't think about it again because I rarely regret it.
5436,91,1,40,ENFP,36,"<neutrality>  Both are time consuming for me. It is rather difficult if there is no harmony between the two. These days, corona has been relieved, so we are keeping harmony well."
5437,91,1,40,ENFP,37,<Yes>  I also like going to art galleries and looking at paintings and sculptures. I like photography too. It is also good to look at the catalogue.
5438,91,1,40,ENFP,38,"<no>  Most try to understand and think they can. Even my teenage son was difficult at first, but he could understand."
5439,91,1,40,ENFP,39,<Yes>  I tend to plan things in advance and stick to them. It makes me feel like I've lived well.
5440,91,1,40,ENFP,40,"<Yes>  It may be a tendency, but I think it's because I know that being anxious after going through difficult times when I was young won't solve it."
5441,91,1,40,ENFP,41,"<no>  I like to talk while talking on the phone. For work, KakaoTalk is convenient, but I like talking on the phone with my acquaintances."
5442,91,1,40,ENFP,42,"<neutrality>  It may or may not take a lot of time. It takes a lot of time to disagree with my beliefs, and even if I think differently, I can accept new ideas right away."
5443,91,1,40,ENFP,43,"<Yes>  I like to maintain a relationship, so I like to create a place first and be together."
5444,91,1,40,ENFP,44,"<neutrality>  tend to go back to the plan and make the best choice. There are times when you need to revise your plan. I went on a trip and my schedule got messed up, but I modified it and went to a completely different destination."
5445,91,1,40,ENFP,45,"<no>  No regrets. Because you can turn back time. Instead, put more weight on not making the same mistake."
5446,91,1,40,ENFP,46,"<no>  I tend to think deeply. I think that if you think deeply about existence and life, you will grow and become a better person."
5447,91,1,40,ENFP,47,<no>  tend to control my emotions well and don't express them well to people. I think it's important not to let emotions become actions. People also admit it.
5448,91,1,40,ENFP,48,"<neutrality>  It depends on the person's attitude. If the attitude of the person admits it, of course I protect it, but if it's the opposite, I don't do that."
5461,92,0,20,ISTP,1,<no>  I don't often make new friends. It's because I'm not used to dating people.
5462,92,0,20,ISTP,2,"<no>  tend to focus on one or two interests. I've enjoyed playing games for a long time, but recently I've been interested in data labeling."
5463,92,0,20,ISTP,3,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on how I feel in that situation. I wonder why you're crying
5464,92,0,20,ISTP,4,<no>  I'm not like that. I tend to think about how to do things in a hurry.
5465,92,0,20,ISTP,5,"<no>  I can't stand the pressure very well. I haven't been like that lately, but I used to feel depressed when faced with situations like that."
5466,92,0,20,ISTP,6,<Yes>  I'm not good at approaching new people. I'm not used to dealing with people.
5467,92,0,20,ISTP,7,"<Yes>  I think it's because I tend to focus on one or two things. I haven't worked on more than two projects at the same time yet, but if that situation arises, I think it will."
5468,92,0,20,ISTP,8,"<no>  It used to be like that, but I don't think it is now. I don't usually have big mood swings."
5469,92,0,20,ISTP,9,<no>  I'm not very good at planning. So I don't use those tools very well.
5470,92,0,20,ISTP,10,"<Yes>  I lack confidence in everything, so even small mistakes feel big. It doesn't seem like that has happened lately."
5471,92,0,20,ISTP,11,"<no>  I'm generally not interested in people, and even if I'm interested in people, I'm not the type to talk to them. Rather than approaching first, I try to accept people who approach me well."
5472,92,0,20,ISTP,12,<Yes>  I'm not very interested. I tend to focus more on my own thoughts and feelings and go over other people's interpretations as if they were just thinking that way.
5473,92,0,20,ISTP,13,<no>  I tend to follow my emotions more. It's because it's easier to judge when I have my emotions well organized. I don't know the evaluation of the surroundings.
5474,92,0,20,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  I plan the schedule for the day once in my head and after that, I tend to work according to the time. Even if you make a plan, it won't work out as planned, and it's hard to force yourself to fit the plan."
5475,92,0,20,ISTP,15,<neutrality>  Sometimes I worry that they will look at me badly. I tend to say things that could hurt others without even knowing it.
5476,92,0,20,ISTP,16,"<no>  I don't like group activities. The more people there are, the more pressure you feel."
5477,92,0,20,ISTP,17,<neutrality>  I tend not to care too much about the type of ending. I tend to focus more on the overall development of the story and the details.
5478,92,0,20,ISTP,18,<neutrality>  I tend to care more about other people's business than my own. It can also be said that I am not good at taking care of my work.
5479,92,0,20,ISTP,19,<no>  I tend to focus on one or two interests. I've never had too many interests.
5480,92,0,20,ISTP,20,"<neutrality>  Rather than worrying about things going wrong, I tend not to have the confidence that things will work out. It's because I often make mistakes or can't carry out work procedures accurately."
5481,92,0,20,ISTP,21,<Yes>  I don't like taking on a leadership role. It's because I don't want to draw people's attention as much as possible.
5482,92,0,20,ISTP,22,<Yes>  I guess I'm far from artistic. It's because emotional inspiration doesn't come out well.
5483,92,0,20,ISTP,23,<neutrality>  I've never thought about this problem. I don't think the world would be a better place if reason was more important.
5484,92,0,20,ISTP,24,"<no>  I tend to procrastinate on housework, so I don¡¯t think it has anything to do with rest. Rather, I tend to pay more attention to having to do housework."
5485,92,0,20,ISTP,25,<neutrality>  It depends on the subject and the situation. How I feel about other people's arguments affects my feelings.
5486,92,0,20,ISTP,26,<Yes>  I'm not trying to attract other people's attention. Because I usually like to be alone.
5487,92,0,20,ISTP,27,<no>  I usually don't change my emotions well. So I'm not sure how it feels.
5488,92,0,20,ISTP,28,"<no>  tend to think that I might not be able to do it, so I don't feel uncomfortable even if I show my inefficient side. I can't remember any examples of this story."
5489,92,0,20,ISTP,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to put off chores more often than other chores. Lately, I've been trying to deal with it right away."
5490,92,0,20,ISTP,30,<no>  I'm not very interested. It's because you have to focus more on reality.
5491,92,0,20,ISTP,31,"<no>  I mostly like to spend time alone. These days, I mostly spend a lot of time alone."
5492,92,0,20,ISTP,32,<neutrality>  I don't like original stories. I am not interested in theoretical discussions.
5493,92,0,20,ISTP,33,"<no>  It may vary depending on the degree, but I tend not to sympathize with people whose backgrounds or values are different from mine."
5494,92,0,20,ISTP,34,<no>  I'd rather delay starting than delay making a decision. I do not delay a decision once I have started.
5495,92,0,20,ISTP,35,"<Yes>  tend to think a lot before making a decision. So, once a decision is made, it is not rethought."
5496,92,0,20,ISTP,36,"<no>  I don't like hanging out with other people, so I spend a lot of time alone. It's like that these days too."
5497,92,0,20,ISTP,37,"<no>  I am not interested in art galleries. When I look at a work of art, I don't think it's interesting or unusual."
5498,92,0,20,ISTP,38,<Yes>  think it's hard to understand the emotions felt in people's usual appearance. Except for being happy or sad.
5499,92,0,20,ISTP,39,"<neutrality>  I don't like it, but I try to plan what I'm going to do that day in the morning."
5500,92,0,20,ISTP,40,"<no>  I feel anxious about whether I am doing well or not. It was small when I was a student, but as time went on, the pressure grew with it."
5501,92,0,20,ISTP,41,<neutrality>  tend to call only when it is absolutely necessary. I don't feel like calling someone first.
5502,92,0,20,ISTP,42,"<neutrality>  I'll give it some thought, but I don't take the time to understand it."
5503,92,0,20,ISTP,43,<no>  I'd rather wait for a call than contact first. But lately I've been trying to make a phone call.
5504,92,0,20,ISTP,44,"<no> In the past, I tried to somehow fit into the plan, but now it's different. I make a plan, but I tend not to dwell too much on details when things go wrong."
5505,92,0,20,ISTP,45,<neutrality>  Most of the things from long ago are hard to remember. I don't regret the past too much.
5506,92,0,20,ISTP,46,"<neutrality>  I tend to think a lot, but I haven't thought about the existence of humans and the reason for living. I guess it's because it's not my interest."
5507,92,0,20,ISTP,47,"<neutrality>  don't think I'm controlling my emotions, but I don't think I'm being swayed either. I don't know about the evaluation of the surroundings."
5508,92,0,20,ISTP,48,"<neutrality>  Rather than saving face, I tend to avoid hurting the other person¡¯s feelings just in case. I feel uncomfortable when other people are not in a good mood."
5521,93,0,30,ISFJ,1,"<no>  It's hard to keep in touch with current friends, and I don't like making new friends."
5522,93,0,30,ISFJ,2,"<no>  Personally, I think it's a waste of time to spend exploring various interests, and if I have to pick one, I'm only interested in the medium of YouTube."
5523,93,0,30,ISFJ,3,"<no>  Sometimes I feel like crying, but not much. If someone else is crying, it is rather calm and comforting, and when such a situation shuts up, I feel sorry for the other person."
5524,93,0,30,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I always have the idea that I don't know what will happen to people, so I tend to make various preparations. Personally, I don't like the occurrence of variables, and when a variable occurs, I tend to get extremely stressed if I can't respond quickly."
5525,93,0,30,ISFJ,5,"<neutrality>  Depending on the type of high-pressure environment, the level of composure tends to vary. Borrowing from two recent experiences, first, I was very impatient when the deadline for submitting the data labeling project was imminent, and second, I was under severe financial pressure, but I coped well with help from people around me."
5526,93,0,30,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  No matter where you are, it's usually not a good idea to introduce yourself and have a conversation with someone new. The reason is because he has a very shy personality."
5527,93,0,30,ISFJ,7,"<no> Even until last year, I started another project after completely completing the project, but there was a gap in the middle, and I thought that even that time was a waste. As a result, starting this year, I changed my mind and tended to start multi-projects as long as I had the ability."
5528,93,0,30,ISFJ,8,"<neutrality>  It's very sentimental, so it's hard to answer. Depending on the situation or state, it changes from moment to moment, so there are times when it is very sentimental and there are times when it is not."
5529,93,0,30,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  I like to end the day in a good mood by making a plan and figuring out what I did during the day and how much. In order to plan according to the current schedule, I tend to use various things such as notepad files, excel files, personal notebooks, and notebooks to make plans and achieve my goals."
5530,93,0,30,ISFJ,10,"<no> If it's a small mistake, I've never doubted my ability or knowledge because I can check the problem and renew it immediately when I look back, so I've never doubted my ability or knowledge."
5531,93,0,30,ISFJ,11,"<no>  Because of my shy personality, I find it very difficult to start a conversation and approach someone I am interested in. I usually don't even try in the first place if I have to start a conversation with someone I'm interested in."
5532,93,0,30,ISFJ,12,<Yes>  do not like or do not try various interpretations because I place great importance on the original interpretation or feeling of a work of art.
5533,93,0,30,ISFJ,13,"<no>  In the past, I've thought about whether emotions or reason are more important, and the conclusion I came to each time was that it's better to follow emotions. It was half and half according to the evaluation of the surroundings."
5534,93,0,30,ISFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I usually like to plan my daily schedule and act according to the plan, but sometimes I act spontaneously without even realizing it. For example, I recently met some friends, and at first I was going to go home by 22:00, but then I got excited and went home at dawn."
5535,93,0,30,ISFJ,15,"<no> I'm sensitive about how I appear to others, and I'm on the side of being a bit obsessive. The reason or reason is because of my desire to always be seen as a good person by the people around me."
5536,93,0,30,ISFJ,16,"<no>  I don't like or enjoy group activities with a lot of people. As a result, I tend to avoid places related to group activities, and if it is unavoidable, I tend to stay quiet with the idea of matching the assortment to some extent."
5537,93,0,30,ISFJ,17,"<no>  I like books and movies with an ending. If you can interpret it in your own way, it is because the work is too broad and the fun factor is lacking. So, it's not a recently aired movie, but I really like the movie The Mask, which was made a long time ago. It is a movie that I personally have seen at least 10 times because the ending is decided with comedy elements and a happy ending."
5538,93,0,30,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality>  There are times when I feel satisfied with my success, and there are times when I feel satisfaction in the process of helping others achieve success, so I can honestly say that it is half and half. The reason is because of the reward psychology that will return to me."
5539,93,0,30,ISFJ,19,"<no> If I think there will be a lot of interest, I tend to try to reduce it then. Because the country knows too well the range of people's thoughts, it is on the side of trying to confine the category of interests within a certain range."
5540,93,0,30,ISFJ,20,"<neutrality> It's not clear because you may or may not be worried depending on what's going on. Taking the data labeling project as an example, I am sensitive to rejection by nature. If the guide is clear and uniform, I don't worry about it going wrong after work. I'm on the verge of worrying about it."
5541,93,0,30,ISFJ,21,"<Yes>  If I have to play a role in a group, I like being part of a group. The reason is that I don't like to receive attention and I tend to feel extreme pressure about a lot of attention."
5542,93,0,30,ISFJ,22,"<neutrality>  My major is Design, and when people around me evaluate me as a person, I think I can say that I am neutral because each evaluation of my artistic inclination is different."
5543,93,0,30,ISFJ,23,"<no> To say that I've thought about it from time to time, I prefer a world where emotions are important because I think that if the world we live in was a world that valued rationality, it would have been a world that was repetitive and hard like a machine."
5544,93,0,30,ISFJ,24,"<Yes>  I think rest is a flow. That's why I prefer to finish my chores first and then relax. If you take a break and then do housework and then take a break and then do other work, it seems that the true meaning of rest is lost."
5545,93,0,30,ISFJ,25,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it's fun and sometimes it's frustrating. The reason is that if the argument leads to the right path, you will look at it happily, and if not, you will look frustrated and not happy."
5546,93,0,30,ISFJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't like the attention, stares, and attention of others. The reason seems to be because of my extremely introverted personality."
5547,93,0,30,ISFJ,27,"<neutrality>  Emotions of joy or pleasure change slowly, whereas negative emotions such as excitement, anger, or irritation tend to change quickly. I think there is a clear difference in the reaction speed of not only me but everyone's personality to what is harmful to me and what is beneficial to me."
5548,93,0,30,ISFJ,28,"<no>  I'm not annoyed, and personally, I'm a person who thinks that it's wrong to set the standard for being efficient or not in any field. To tell you my experience, when I was working as a manager in a service business in the past, others tried to dissuade me by saying that I was not efficient and that I was doing too much work unnecessarily, but the owner often praised me for running the store because of me."
5549,93,0,30,ISFJ,29,"<no>  If possible, I try to do as much as possible on the same day or at least within two days. Until recently, these efforts have been made, so I feel good when I go to sleep at the end of the day."
5550,93,0,30,ISFJ,30,"<no>  In today's busy world of focusing on the present and preparing for the future, it doesn't seem like a good idea to spend time in the unclear world of the afterlife."
5551,93,0,30,ISFJ,31,"<no>  I was like that in the past, and even now, I am a person who feels the time alone is very important and precious."
5552,93,0,30,ISFJ,32,"<neutrality> Depending on your field of interest, you may find it interesting or boring. Among them, when I took the news as an example, I was not interested in discussions about national administration and was bored, but I was interested in discussions about coping with the current situation related to the weather, so I remember watching the news without any time to get bored."
5553,93,0,30,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  Even if the background is different and the environment in which you have lived is different, if you have the same empathy, you can empathize with others."
5554,93,0,30,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  I tend to be very deliberate about making decisions. Since the point of the question is to answer the question of procrastination, I answered neutrally."
5555,93,0,30,ISFJ,35,"<no> Because any decision is taken slowly and deliberately, I tend to make decisions over and over again, not all at once. Even after making a decision, we always review it. I may look foolish in the eyes of others, but I think I am unnecessarily meticulous because of my personality."
5556,93,0,30,ISFJ,36,"<no>  I tend not to feel pleasure or interest in interacting with someone. These days, I don't try to make new people, but I maintain relationships with people who have been friends so far."
5557,93,0,30,ISFJ,37,"<neutrality>  Depending on the subject, I either like or dislike going to art museums. I don't usually like to appreciate art works, but I remember that I enjoyed the webtoon exhibition in the past with interest and pleasure."
5558,93,0,30,ISFJ,38,"<no>  tend to hear from friends around me that I'm good at reading people's expressions, minds, and psychology. Usually, no matter what he says, he puts rhetoric appropriately, sympathizes with him, leads the conversation comfortably, and listens to him, so he's the type to easily understand other people's feelings."
5559,93,0,30,ISFJ,39,<Yes>  I love planning my to-dos at the start of the day. The reason is because I feel like I'm going to make a satisfying and proud day for some reason.
5560,93,0,30,ISFJ,40,"<no> There is always anxiety and tension. I think it's because of my innate tendency, and I've never thought badly, but rather think in a good direction."
5561,93,0,30,ISFJ,41,"<no>  I like hearing people's voices, asking how they're doing, and hearing news. The reason is that I don't like mediums such as messengers or text messages."
5562,93,0,30,ISFJ,42,"<neutrality>  think the amount of time to spend on my opinion and other opinions will vary depending on whether they are valid or not. But usually I'm not the type to express my opinion and force it, so I don't have any memorable experiences."
5563,93,0,30,ISFJ,43,"<neutrality>  To be honest, when I want to contact my friends first, they often contact me first."
5564,93,0,30,ISFJ,44,"<no>  In the first place, due to my personality, I try not to create a situation that disrupts the plan. That's why I don't remember that I made an effort recently or in the past because there was a setback in my plan."
5565,93,0,30,ISFJ,45,"<neutrality>  I think everyone makes mistakes and regrets it, but I regret it when I think of mistakes from a long time ago, but after regretting it for a while, I tend to take it as comfort and think in a good direction."
5566,93,0,30,ISFJ,46,"<no> Personally, I think I think more deeply than anyone else about the reason for human existence and life. It's a thought that suddenly pops up, but it's because I'm interested in causal relationships, improving the quality of life, and thinking about the life I pursue."
5567,93,0,30,ISFJ,47,"<no>  Because of my introverted personality, my understanding naturally broadened without my knowledge, so I tend to manage my emotions and control them well, and the evaluations of my acquaintances were not different from what I thought."
5568,93,0,30,ISFJ,48,"<Yes>  There are many things that are important to people, but among them, face is considered to be more important than anything else, so I tend to change the topic or correct it by pretending to agree to save face even if the other person has made a mistake. The reason is that it is not intentional, but by doing these actions, people around me look good on me and all the members are happy."
5581,94,1,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  I only meet family and old people. As I live, I think my family is the best rather than people who only contact me when I need it."
5582,94,1,30,ISTJ,2,"<neutrality>  These days, I don't have time to do my hobbies because I don't have time because of childcare, but I have a hobby of watching overseas dramas in my spare time."
5583,94,1,30,ISTJ,3,<no>  I want to know why you are crying and I want to solve it. It's usually frustrating when that happens.
5584,94,1,30,ISTJ,4,<Yes>  I usually make a couple of fallbacks. This is because a lot of unexpected situations happen when you live with a child.
5585,94,1,30,ISTJ,5,"<Yes>  I tend to try to do that. They don't like noise very much, but they need a lot of composure to not get angry while raising children and listening to cries."
5586,94,1,30,ISTJ,6,<Yes>  Meeting new people is a bit daunting. Because I'm very shy.
5587,94,1,30,ISTJ,7,<neutrality>  I look at my working hours and prioritize them. Because I want to complete two projects if possible.
5588,94,1,30,ISTJ,8,"<no>  I guess I'm not sentimental. If you look at the problem situation, you will think about the solution first."
5589,94,1,30,ISTJ,9,<Yes>  I like to write down my schedule. Jot down your schedule using your iPad or Samsung Calendar so you don't forget and execute your plans.
5590,94,1,30,ISTJ,10,"<Yes>  If I make a little mistake these days, I feel like my self-esteem drops. Recently, when a project came up with a fingerprint or example that I couldn't understand, I felt very left behind in society."
5591,94,1,30,ISTJ,11,"<no>  I am difficult. Because it is unpredictable what kind of story that person will like or dislike me, I usually do not speak first except for greetings."
5592,94,1,30,ISTJ,12,"<Yes>  I'm not very interested in art, but I tend to try for my child. This is because art is a level at which beauty can be discussed."
5593,94,1,30,ISTJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. When I see myself, I judge that I can share what I want to do and can do. People around me seem to think so too."
5594,94,1,30,ISTJ,14,"<neutrality>  I like to be spontaneous unless I'm in a hurry. When I look back on the past, I usually do things by procrastinating, and there are many times when I solve the visible things first."
5595,94,1,30,ISTJ,15,"<Yes>  I tend not to worry. Because they are not interested in me, and I have no interest or need for them."
5596,94,1,30,ISTJ,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy group activities. These days, it's better to go with your family to a place where there are few people, where it's quiet or where the scenery is beautiful, and where it's a good experience."
5597,94,1,30,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I hate open endings. It's good to tell the director or writer what they want from the results, but I think it's frustrating to stop talking. That's why I love Harry Potter."
5598,94,1,30,ISTJ,18,<no>  I don't feel much satisfaction in supporting others. I think my consideration is not enough to work in line with others.
5599,94,1,30,ISTJ,19,"<no>  I don't have many interests. It's partly because I don't have enough time, and partly because I've been paying more attention to parenting lately."
5600,94,1,30,ISTJ,20,<Yes>  am often worried. It's like a habit you got into when you got married. I think it's because of the pressure to have a good family.
5601,94,1,30,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid leadership positions. This is usually because leadership positions require a lot of responsibility, sociability and control over people."
5602,94,1,30,ISTJ,22,"<Yes>  I don't seem to have any artistic inclinations. This is because you have to go to an exhibition and see people giving various impressions, or you have to interpret them to understand them."
5603,94,1,30,ISTJ,23,"<no>  If I had only thought about the opposite sex, I think society would have changed so harshly and coldly. Many people tried to find the child's mother, and seeing that, I felt that emotions are more important in the world and that a better society is being created with that little warmth."
5604,94,1,30,ISTJ,24,"<no>  I tend to start procrastinating. It's because if you do your work in advance, you won't move a little busily, so you'll have more time to do housework. After estimating the time of housework, move with a break."
5605,94,1,30,ISTJ,25,"<Yes>  I am delighted It's because through the argument, you can understand the two people by listening to their thoughts, perspectives, and logic."
5606,94,1,30,ISTJ,26,<Yes>  I usually try to keep quiet. This is because they do not cause damage or enjoy the noise around them.
5607,94,1,30,ISTJ,27,<neutrality>  I tend to try not to change my emotions quickly. It's because I felt that it was the most necessary thing in discipline while raising children.
5608,94,1,30,ISTJ,28,"<neutrality>  am not annoyed if there is no damage to me. I think that person has his own style, so when working in society, even if it is slow, he did not touch it."
5609,94,1,30,ISTJ,29,"<Yes>  I postpone it with a little free time. Even recently, if it's not urgent, I'm on the side of putting it off until my child's house time."
5610,94,1,30,ISTJ,30,"<no>  I don't think it's interesting. When a person dies, I think it's the end. Because I think a movie like Coco or Shin is just a movie."
5611,94,1,30,ISTJ,31,"<neutrality>  I usually want to be alone when my stamina is low. These days, I'm working out at the same time, so I want to spend a little more time with my family."
5612,94,1,30,ISTJ,32,"<neutrality>  I need theory, but I think practice is also important. This is because problems or directions that cannot be predicted in theory exist in practice."
5613,94,1,30,ISTJ,33,"<neutrality>  can understand rather than empathize. If you listen to the other person's situation and feelings, you will be able to understand that this is why you acted this way and thought this way, and you will be able to look back on the situation."
5614,94,1,30,ISTJ,34,"<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly and revise them as I work. Because we usually tend to think after making such a decision, sometimes there are cases of regret."
5615,94,1,30,ISTJ,35,"<no> After I make a decision, I tend to look for problems and revise my decision. Even if you purchase an item, there are many times when you modify your order after purchasing it to see if there are alternatives before delivery."
5616,94,1,30,ISTJ,36,"<no>  These days, I tend to take a break with my alone time. It's because you need a lot of stamina to spend time with your family than you think."
5617,94,1,30,ISTJ,37,"<neutrality>  didn't enjoy art museums very much, but I became interested in media art, which I can see often these days, by taking my children to show them a lot. I think it's more fun than I thought, but I'm not sure yet."
5618,94,1,30,ISTJ,38,"<Yes>  I do sometimes. When I hear a conversation like a complaint that repeats the same thing over and over again, it is frustrating to hear the same complaint even though I have comforted and coped with it."
5619,94,1,30,ISTJ,39,"<neutrality>  Not every day, but I like weekend plans. Choosing where to travel with your family is always fun."
5620,94,1,30,ISTJ,40,<no>  Anxiety is often felt. I think it happened because I often felt like I had no place to ask for help after getting married.
5621,94,1,30,ISTJ,41,<no>  I prefer phone calls. This is because I think that there are fewer misunderstandings due to the tone or feeling that cannot be conveyed in words.
5622,94,1,30,ISTJ,42,"<neutrality>  think it's a little different depending on the person who made that opinion. If someone I know made that comment, I'd spend some time trying to understand it, but if not, I wouldn't bother thinking about it. This is often the case when talking to people around you."
5623,94,1,30,ISTJ,43,"<no>  I tend not to contact them first. It's because I usually listen to you when I contact you, so it's because I have a lot of emotional consumption."
5624,94,1,30,ISTJ,44,"<no> When plans go awry, we usually discard them and come up with new alternatives. If the restaurant I wanted to go to was closed, I searched for another restaurant at that time rather than feeling depressed."
5625,94,1,30,ISTJ,45,"<no>  Since mistakes made long ago are usually irreversible, I tend not to look back unless there is room for improvement."
5626,94,1,30,ISTJ,46,<Yes>  It's because my life is already busy and there are many things to do to think about the existence and reason of life.
5627,94,1,30,ISTJ,47,"<no>  I usually try to control myself, and people around me say that I have changed a lot."
5628,94,1,30,ISTJ,48,"<Yes>  If you already know that person is wrong and are ashamed of it, you can improve, so I don't think there's any reason to face it further."
5641,95,1,40,INTJ,1,"<no>  As a mother raising children, there are many things to do, but interacting with new people takes too much time and effort."
5642,95,1,40,INTJ,2,"<Yes> These days, the part I'm most interested in is the education of children, and I often think that I want to teach them myself, but I'm especially interested in mathematics again."
5643,95,1,40,INTJ,3,"<Yes>  I often cry while watching emotional dramas, but I often think about how I would feel if I were the main character, and I feel sad thinking about the sadness from the main character's point of view."
5644,95,1,40,INTJ,4,"<Yes> When I plan something, I always have a plan B. Because I do my best to go according to the first plan, but when it doesn't go as planned, if there is no alternative, I think it's stressful."
5645,95,1,40,INTJ,5,"<neutrality>  I tend to get stressed out in a pressured environment, but I still tell myself to calmly deal with it and try to deal with it calmly. For example, if I was late for an appointment, I tried to act more leisurely, thinking that I could get hurt if I rushed."
5646,95,1,40,INTJ,6,"<Yes>  It's a bit awkward to hang out with new people, but I'm much more comfortable talking to people I know. Because there are so many things to talk about with people you know, so you don't have to try too hard."
5647,95,1,40,INTJ,7,"<Yes> If there are multiple projects, I think I finish the project I can finish as much as possible and start another project. For example, when I look at the work of Crowdworks, I feel comfortable doing another project after finishing a project that I can finish. I don't like it because it distracts me from multiple things happening."
5648,95,1,40,INTJ,8,"<no>  Even when going camping, other people pay attention to even one item and care about emotional things, but I like practical things and comfortable things the most. Just looking at it, I think I'm a little far from being sentimental."
5649,95,1,40,INTJ,9,"<Yes>  For example, I use Naver Memo or Calendar a lot. Even if you don't forget important things and don't think about it, if you set an alarm, it's convenient because you can know in advance, and it's convenient because you don't have to think about it."
5650,95,1,40,INTJ,10,"<no>  There are certain things in the house where I have to put things in their place, but when I don't, I think I suspect other family members first. I know, I have an experience that I had."
5651,95,1,40,INTJ,11,"<neutrality>  I tend to talk first when I think I might be a good person, but the part where I talk for a long time is a bit difficult."
5652,95,1,40,INTJ,12,"<no>  I think it's good to go to a picture exhibition for children's education, but it's hard to even go. Art works are just pretty, not pretty. I don't think it's that important in life."
5653,95,1,40,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  I think that's really right. There are many times when my husband says that I am not emotional, and even when I saw it, I think there are many times when emotions are extravagant and realistic."
5654,95,1,40,INTJ,14,<no>  I guess I'm not good at improvisation. It's because I write down what I have to do that day on the calendar and do it on that day and draw a line.
5655,95,1,40,INTJ,15,"<Yes>  am a student of the children, but as a parent, I think I care about how I talk and how I look when others see me. I think I think my appearance has an influence on children."
5656,95,1,40,INTJ,16,"<no>  There are no group activities. There are hygiene issues due to the influence of Corona, and I don't actually have time due to childcare."
5657,95,1,40,INTJ,17,<no>  I think I like works that have an ending. I hate ambiguous endings. So I enjoyed the squid game. The game continues until only one player emerges.
5658,95,1,40,INTJ,18,<no>  Other people's success makes me sick to my stomach. The honest answer is that I want to be successful and help that person.
5659,95,1,40,INTJ,19,"<Yes>  I have so many interests, such as sports, cooking, education, cleaning, and finance. But I don't have time to do everything as much as I want. So I'm trying hard not to miss it by investing a short amount of time."
5660,95,1,40,INTJ,20,"<Yes>  I was good at flying, but when I had a baby, I got worried and developed a phobia. I saw a rebroadcast of the 9/11 terror attack on TV, but I thought it was horrific and I didn't have to experience it, so I don't fly."
5661,95,1,40,INTJ,21,"<Yes>  If you take on a leadership role, I think it will be stressful because of the responsibility. As a member, I am confident in being sincere, but I feel burdened by receiving attention and responsibility."
5662,95,1,40,INTJ,22,"<no>  I think you have a great artistic sense. I'm good at making small repairs with my hands beautifully in the house, and since I was young, I have dexterity, so my children seem to be like that too."
5663,95,1,40,INTJ,23,"<Yes>  I often think so. When I see children starving in Africa, I often feel that the materials and money required for the emotional part of society are wasted."
5664,95,1,40,INTJ,24,"<Yes> No matter how hard and tired it is, I want to finish my housework and rest. In the unfinished state, even if I take a break, my mind is not stable and I keep thinking about it."
5665,95,1,40,INTJ,25,"<neutrality>  Rather than having fun, I'm curious. I want to find out what's going on in the line where there's no damage, and I want to judge it."
5666,95,1,40,INTJ,26,"<Yes>  When waiting for the children in front of the school, if there are too many parents, it feels a bit burdensome, and I think it is when I avoid it."
5667,95,1,40,INTJ,27,"<no>  Emotions usually change a lot, but I don't think that's the case. When something good happens, I think I try not to show it too much and try to act the same way."
5668,95,1,40,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  When I was working at an old cafe, I was so annoyed when I saw lazy part-timers."
5669,95,1,40,INTJ,29,"<no>  I really hate procrastination. So no matter how tired the kids are during vacation homework, I make sure to do what I have to do that day and let them go to sleep."
5670,95,1,40,INTJ,30,"<no>  Believing in the afterlife is a religious thing, but it is non-religious and only has a very scientific idea that people become soil when they die."
5671,95,1,40,INTJ,31,"<no>  Time alone is the most comfortable, and it is efficient and comfortable whether it be exercise, work or leisure."
5672,95,1,40,INTJ,32,"<Yes> For example, if there is a family gathering, I want to systematically plan the place and time, but I think many people have the mindset that just go and do it as soon as it shuts up."
5673,95,1,40,INTJ,33,"<no>  I think it's hard to understand people from different backgrounds. On the other hand, it's really hard to meet someone who fully empathizes with my background. I have communicated with my friends about my family situation and my childhood background, but no one can really understand."
5674,95,1,40,INTJ,34,"<no>  When something comes up that needs to be resolved, I like to do it in advance and take a break. For example, if there is a picture or writing that I want to try, I do it right away and wait for the announcement date."
5675,95,1,40,INTJ,35,"<Yes>  I'm not good at repeating myself. Instead, when making a decision, think carefully and for a long time, and don't change things. That way you won't regret it later."
5676,95,1,40,INTJ,36,"<no>  The way to relieve fatigue is to spend time in a quiet place without noise, so I think alone time is the way to relieve fatigue. These days, I am staying at home while taking care of the children while working from home."
5677,95,1,40,INTJ,37,"<neutrality>  I think you are interested in art. I have a desire to show children's education awards. However, there are times when I feel upset because I don¡¯t feel like I have enough time or money to go."
5678,95,1,40,INTJ,38,"<no>  It happens when I fight with my husband over trivial matters. I want to change my husband's habits by nagging him, but I run into his position that I have to understand him as it is."
5679,95,1,40,INTJ,39,<Yes>  I have to-dos written on my calendar every day and I set several alarms. It's because I want to work that day without missing it.
5680,95,1,40,INTJ,40,"<no>  have anxiety about old age while raising children. When I look at the part where my parents are not financially free, I think it's because they worry about their parents and their children."
5681,95,1,40,INTJ,41,"<Yes>  I have feelings for my parents, but I can't call them often. Maybe it's because he doesn't show a lot of aegyo, but even saying hello is a chicken heart."
5682,95,1,40,INTJ,42,"<Yes>  After a fight with my husband, I don't understand right away, but I think I understand a little bit when I think about it alone for about a day and think about it for a lot of time."
5683,95,1,40,INTJ,43,"<no>  I'm the type of person who accepts if I lead the meeting first, rather than asking to meet first. I'm busy and I don't know if the other person is the right time."
5684,95,1,40,INTJ,44,"<no>  I made a plan for the family gathering with difficulty and made it on time, but I canceled it because I was too exhausted to plan again because there was a setback."
5685,95,1,40,INTJ,45,"<Yes>  sometimes think about the mistakes I made when I was in school or when I was young. As I think about it, I feel ashamed and want to erase it. I think it's because my self-esteem is low these days."
5686,95,1,40,INTJ,46,"<no>  I think you are thinking deeply. Scientists think that in reality, human beings are just one of the creatures living on Earth among the stars in the universe. After someone dies, they are easily forgotten by people."
5687,95,1,40,INTJ,47,"<Yes> When I fight with someone, I think I talk a lot and get excited at the moment. My husband also told me to control my anger a little when we fight."
5688,95,1,40,INTJ,48,"<no>  If it is clear that it is the other person's fault, I think it's right for that person to apologize clearly, so I think I'm the type to make them admit it. Because I think that's why the same thing doesn't happen again next time, and I think that's more important than face."
5701,96,0,30,ESFJ,1,"<neutrality>  don't try to make new friends by force, but I tend to make friends by meeting new people whenever I get a chance."
5702,96,0,30,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  Recently, I have been interested in real estate, so I am studying books and cases related to real estate history and investment."
5703,96,0,30,ESFJ,3,<Yes>  I want to cry more when I know the reason for crying rather than just crying. I am especially good at empathizing with characters in dramas and movies.
5704,96,0,30,ESFJ,4,"<Yes>  When you start something, you start by making several plans. We make various plans such as Plan A, B, C, and D, and try to prepare for situations that may arise."
5705,96,0,30,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  I think I tend to keep my composure well in a high-pressure environment. In my recent experience, I had to make an important presentation, and the executives asked questions about the materials, but the presentation went smoothly because they answered well."
5706,96,0,30,ESFJ,6,"<neutrality>  Talk to people you know, but don't necessarily reject new people. It doesn't approach first, but it doesn't push away those who approach. Meeting new people is new fun."
5707,96,0,30,ESFJ,7,"<neutrality> If a project takes a lot of time to finish, we work on several projects together, but focus on projects that can be completed within a short period of time (within a day), finish one and start the other."
5708,96,0,30,ESFJ,8,"<Yes>  When I watch a drama or a movie, I think it is sentimental because I am good at empathy and I tend to get sentimental like thinking about a rainy day."
5709,96,0,30,ESFJ,9,<Yes>  I'm working on a monthly weekly plan and I'm committed to sticking to the plan.
5710,96,0,30,ESFJ,10,"<no>  I think everyone makes mistakes, and I think I do too. I recently entered a number incorrectly, but rather than doubting me, I passed it on by saying that anyone can make a mistake."
5711,96,0,30,ESFJ,11,"<Yes>  I'm not very patient with questions, so if there's someone I'm interested in, I tend to talk to them first."
5712,96,0,30,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  don't have much experience and knowledge about art works, so I'm not very interested."
5713,96,0,30,ESFJ,13,"<no>  I try to follow my reason, but I think that I tend to follow my emotions a lot when faced with situations, and those around me evaluate me that way."
5714,96,0,30,ESFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I make monthly and weekly plans and move, but I also adjust a lot spontaneously according to my emotions. When the weather is particularly nice, we revise our plans and go out to get some fresh air."
5715,96,0,30,ESFJ,15,"<Yes>  I don't worry about what other people think, because I don't think it affects my life."
5716,96,0,30,ESFJ,16,"<neutrality>  I enjoy it with people close to me, but I don't enjoy it very much with people I don't know."
5717,96,0,30,ESFJ,17,<no>  It's better to have an ending than an open ending. The reason is that the open ending feels like the story is not finished.
5718,96,0,30,ESFJ,18,"<no>  I think I am different from other people. Therefore, they do not take great interest and satisfaction in the success of others."
5719,96,0,30,ESFJ,19,"<no>  If you have a lot of interests, look at the part that interests you the most and do the rest. Recently, I became interested in swimming and real estate, but I became interested in real estate first because of time."
5720,96,0,30,ESFJ,20,"<no>  I think the process is more important than the result. Therefore, I try to do my best in the process of work rather than making things go well or go wrong."
5721,96,0,30,ESFJ,21,"<no>  Since before, I have often taken on the role of leader in groups, so I don't dare to step out, but I don't avoid it either."
5722,96,0,30,ESFJ,22,<Yes>  I think so because I have no interest in artistic fields such as painting or music.
5723,96,0,30,ESFJ,23,"<no>  It would be a different world if we valued reason more, but I don't necessarily think it's a better world. I just think it's a different world from now."
5724,96,0,30,ESFJ,24,"<neutrality>  Depends on how tired you are. If I'm too tired, I'll take a break and if not, I'll try to do housework first."
5725,96,0,30,ESFJ,25,<Yes> It's interesting to see how others explain their logic. The process of developing and agreeing on ideas that are different from mine is interesting.
5726,96,0,30,ESFJ,26,"<no>  If it's not really necessary to create controversy, I won't come forward."
5727,96,0,30,ESFJ,27,"<Yes>  Even if you feel good, there are many things that make you feel bad about someone else's word."
5728,96,0,30,ESFJ,28,<no>  He and I are different people so I'm not annoyed. There must be things I do more inefficiently than he does.
5729,96,0,30,ESFJ,29,"<no>  If there is something I need to do, I tend to do it at that time. It's so embarrassing when I don't do what I have to do."
5730,96,0,30,ESFJ,30,<Yes>  Because I'm curious about the world I don't know. I am also going to end my life and I wonder what will happen.
5731,96,0,30,ESFJ,31,"<no>  These days, time spent with family is so precious and enjoyable. So I love spending time with other people, especially my family."
5732,96,0,30,ESFJ,32,"<no>  There was a fundamental debate about what to do, and it was interesting and interesting that people think differently depending on their experiences."
5733,96,0,30,ESFJ,33,"<neutrality>  If you have full knowledge of the person's background, you can relate, but if you don't, it's hard. Recently, a colleague talked about his hardships, but I couldn't relate much because I didn't know the hidden stories."
5734,96,0,30,ESFJ,34,<no>  There is no need to postpone making decisions. Because that's what you have to do anyway.
5735,96,0,30,ESFJ,35,<no>  There is no need to dwell on irreversible decisions. I try to make that decision the right one.
5736,96,0,30,ESFJ,36,"<no>  I prefer spending quiet time with my family rather than parties and events. In particular, take a light walk to relieve fatigue."
5737,96,0,30,ESFJ,37,<no>  I don't really like art galleries or art works. Because I don't feel much interest in it.
5738,96,0,30,ESFJ,38,"<no>  Even if you don't fully empathize with other people's feelings, you never have a hard time understanding them."
5739,96,0,30,ESFJ,39,<Yes>  I tend to work on a monthly and weekly plan. I think that's efficient.
5740,96,0,30,ESFJ,40,"<Yes> There was no particular trigger, and I didn't feel insecure since I was a child. I was born with a tendency not to feel anxious."
5741,96,0,30,ESFJ,41,<no>  I don't avoid phone calls unless I have to leave a reason.
5742,96,0,30,ESFJ,42,"<no>  I don't bother trying to understand other opinions. If you come and express your position, I will listen to you, but I will not visit you first and ask."
5743,96,0,30,ESFJ,43,<no>  usually get in touch with other people without first contacting them.
5744,96,0,30,ESFJ,44,"<no>  If your plans get in the way, you change your plans. There was a big setback in a recent project, but rather than going back to the original, we changed the project plan according to the situation."
5745,96,0,30,ESFJ,45,<no>  I don't bother to rethink my old mistakes and regret them. I can't remember too well.
5746,96,0,30,ESFJ,46,"<no>  just worry about my life from time to time, but I don't worry about philosophical things like human existence."
5747,96,0,30,ESFJ,47,"<neutrality>  Depending on the situation, you can control your emotions well, but depending on the situation, you are evaluated as showing a lot of emotions."
5748,96,0,30,ESFJ,48,"<neutrality>  Depends on the other party. If you need to save face, you will save it, but if you are a person who repeats it, it is not."
5761,97,0,30,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality> I'm not the type to make an effort to make new friends, but I think I meet new friends naturally while living in society."
5762,97,0,30,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  Recently, while purchasing a vehicle, I am exploring maintenance knowledge and management methods related to the vehicle."
5763,97,0,30,ESTJ,3,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on what kind of person the person crying is to you and what kind of situation they are in.
5764,97,0,30,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  The more important the project, the more contingent it is. That puts my mind at ease."
5765,97,0,30,ESTJ,5,"<neutrality>  I tend to keep my composure when a lot of work is given, but it's difficult to keep my composure when there's pressure from interpersonal work."
5766,97,0,30,ESTJ,6,"<Yes>  Wouldn't it be rude to talk first? Or what if you get ignored? Because of my defensive psychology, I usually talk to people I already know."
5767,97,0,30,ESTJ,7,"<neutrality> If I have a lot of light tasks, I tend to play multiplayer, and if I have important tasks, I tend to focus on one thing."
5768,97,0,30,ESTJ,8,"<neutrality>  Depending on the condition and atmosphere, there are times when I can be sentimental more easily than others, but usually I am on the rational side."
5769,97,0,30,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  When traveling or working, most of the time, we use Excel sheets or calendars to plan the contents."
5770,97,0,30,ESTJ,10,"<no> Rather than doubting or blaming your own abilities, first check what you are missing around you. If you make the mistake of oversleeping, set an additional alarm on your phone or buy an additional alarm."
5771,97,0,30,ESTJ,11,"<neutrality>  I am working in human resources for a company. If it's a business approach, I tend to talk comfortably, but if it's not, I'm not the type to approach first."
5772,97,0,30,ESTJ,12,"<Yes> The sentence itself, which refers to various interpretations of art works, seems to be an earring when worn on the ear, and a nose ring when worn on the nose. I'm positive about the discussion. But I don't think that will help me."
5773,97,0,30,ESTJ,13,"<neutrality>  Emotional in human relationships, but rational in work and other social life. Like me, the evaluations around me are similar."
5774,97,0,30,ESTJ,14,"<Yes>  I plan on important or special occasions, but most of the time I do things I want to do spontaneously."
5775,97,0,30,ESTJ,15,"<no>  I try to be careful with my word choices when communicating with people, but I tend to worry about what other people will think of me if I don't have the conversation."
5776,97,0,30,ESTJ,16,"<no>  It's not that I don't like doing group activities, but I don't like the burden of obligations to keep when I belong to a place, so I tend not to participate."
5777,97,0,30,ESTJ,17,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the movie. It was fun when the ending of the recent movie Dokjeon came out with an open ending, and as the ending was later released in the director's cut, I was able to feel the fun elements of both an open ending and a closed ending movie at the same time."
5778,97,0,30,ESTJ,18,"<neutrality>  prioritize my own success, but I also believe that the success of those around me must go along with it. If you lean to one side, I think those who are unsuccessful will have low self-esteem and be unhappy."
5779,97,0,30,ESTJ,19,"<Yes>  I am in charge of human resources, general affairs, and marketing in the company. All three of these are tasks that I am interested in. I don't know what to do because I recently received an offer for a job different from the job I'm currently doing from my acquaintances."
5780,97,0,30,ESTJ,20,"<no> When it comes to important tasks, I tend not to worry because I plan ahead and prepare for the next best thing."
5781,97,0,30,ESTJ,21,<neutrality>  I am willing to take on the role if I can publicly acknowledge that I am the most qualified to serve as a leader in a group.
5782,97,0,30,ESTJ,22,"<Yes>  Since I was young, I didn't like art subjects and I didn't have good manual dexterity. I don't like going to exhibitions either."
5783,97,0,30,ESTJ,23,"<neutrality>  The standard of a better world is different for each person, but if reason was valued, it would have been a more developed world. It would just be a desolate world without warmth. I don't think that's a better world."
5784,97,0,30,ESTJ,24,"<neutrality>  If you want to get your chores done first, but you're too tired, the reality is often not."
5785,97,0,30,ESTJ,25,"<neutrality> If it's a productive debate, it's enjoyable. If it's an unproductive argument, I tend to get attention."
5786,97,0,30,ESTJ,26,"<neutrality>  It's a situation where I have to step in, the purpose is clear, and I tend to draw attention by stepping out and making a justification."
5787,97,0,30,ESTJ,27,"<neutrality>  Emotions don't change quickly when you're alone, and they seem to change quickly when the environment around you makes it so. I just try to be vigilant and control myself."
5788,97,0,30,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  If you are not as efficient as I am, you usually feel stuffy inside. There are many times when I think, 'Why should I do this or that?'"
5789,97,0,30,ESTJ,29,"<neutrality> It depends on your condition, mood, and importance. Vehicles are expensive and important, so I tend to do preventive maintenance in advance, but I tend to put off house cleaning and laundry."

6107,102,1,40,ESFP,47,"<Yes>  It's hard to control my emotions, so I tend to show them well. I think my downside is that I have a very moody personality."
6108,102,1,40,ESFP,48,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the opponent and the situation. If you need to save the face of the other person, you can do that."
6121,103,1,30,ISTP,1,"<no> First of all, I don't think I want to make new friends, and the process of meeting new people and getting to know them is often mentally tiring."

6123,103,1,30,ISTP,3,"<neutrality>  When I see a character in a drama or a movie crying, I tend to burst into tears right away, and I tend to cry a lot when I attend congratulatory events such as a wedding or first birthday party for someone I don't know well. Even though I don't want to cry, tears come out, so whenever that happens, I always think, 'Why on earth am I crying?'"
6124,103,1,30,ISTP,4,"<no>  There are very few cases where I think that it is something that needs to be prepared for, and when things go wrong, I tend to deal with them whenever I think of them."
6125,103,1,30,ISTP,5,"<neutrality>  I haven't felt much of a high-pressure environment, but I've seen it a few times, but it doesn't seem to bother me much, even if it's a little uncomfortable in my heart."

6131,103,1,30,ISTP,11,"<Yes> For example, I have a puppy, and I've talked to other dog owners about dogs I don't know many times, but it wasn't difficult at all."
6132,103,1,30,ISTP,12,"<Yes>  First of all, there will be a discussion about what to know, but even looking at art works, it seems that there is no interest because there is no inspiration."
6133,103,1,30,ISTP,13,"<Yes>  thought of myself as a very irrational person, but I hear a lot of people around me saying that they seem to be more focused on resolving the cause rather than empathizing with people's feelings."
6134,103,1,30,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  No matter how much I plan, if there is something else I want to do, I tend to put the plan aside and do what I want to do first."
6135,103,1,30,ISTP,15,"<Yes>  don't know myself well, but I don't want to care how other people see me, and another reason is that I know that no matter how hard I try to look good, not everyone will like me anyway."
6136,103,1,30,ISTP,16,"<no>  Even if I meet people I like, I usually only meet with one or two people, and I want to avoid group activities because they are too hectic and tiring."
6137,103,1,30,ISTP,17,"<no>  I don't like works that can be interpreted in many ways, and I prefer an open ending even if it's obvious."
6138,103,1,30,ISTP,18,"<no>  I've never thought of feeling satisfied by helping others when I'm having a hard time, and I think it's meaningful to help others when I'm doing well."
6139,103,1,30,ISTP,19,"<Yes> Recently, I became interested in studying certification, so I looked for and studied certification that I could obtain by self-study.

6142,103,1,30,ISTP,22,"<no>  I've heard a lot of stories about being original, and I feel like I have quite latent artistic inclinations because I'm good with my hands."
6143,103,1,30,ISTP,23,"<no>  Because the standard of a better world will be different for each person, I don't think it would have been a better world if I put more importance on reason."

6148,103,1,30,ISTP,28,"<Yes>  get very frustrated when I see things that can be done right away move several times or take a long time, and I get a little annoyed thinking, ¡°Why do you do things like that?¡±"
6149,103,1,30,ISTP,29,"<Yes>  If it's directly related to me, I don't often put off until the end, but I often put off things that I don't think are very important, such as things that I've been asked to do."
6150,103,1,30,ISTP,30,"<Yes>  This is because when I listen to the stories of people who have experienced the afterlife in the media, I am very curious and curious about whether it really exists."
6151,103,1,30,ISTP,31,"<no>  Sometimes I feel like hanging out with people, but spending time alone is the most comfortable and best."
6152,103,1,30,ISTP,32,"<no>  For example, I don't know much about fields like physics or philosophy, but I'm not interested in them, and I think they're a little interesting."
6153,103,1,30,ISTP,33,"<Yes>  Even if the environment in which you have lived is completely different, the feelings people feel are usually similar, so I feel empathy."
6154,103,1,30,ISTP,34,"<no>  It's quite frustrating to see them not being able to make decisions quickly, and when I'm with people like that, I tend to have the decision-making power."
6155,103,1,30,ISTP,35,"<neutrality>  There are times when I keep thinking about it again, and there are times when I quickly forget it or can't remember it."
6156,103,1,30,ISTP,36,"<no>  Fun parties and events make me more tired, so I think spending time alone is much better."
6157,103,1,30,ISTP,37,"<no>  I have no interest in getting to know or understanding the world of art, so I never go to see art."
6158,103,1,30,ISTP,38,"<neutrality>  I rarely find it hard to understand other people's feelings in normal times, but I often feel that way during couple fights."
6159,103,1,30,ISTP,39,"<no>  Whether it's work or personal, I tend to improvise most of the time rather than plan."
6160,103,1,30,ISTP,40,"<no>  As I became an adult and experienced various difficult things while living a social life, I wonder if I started to feel insecure."
6161,103,1,30,ISTP,41,"<neutrality>  I don't have much to say about phone calls that don't have much to say, such as a simple hello call or a phone call out of boredom, so I want to avoid it if possible."
6162,103,1,30,ISTP,42,"<no> Understanding other people's thoughts is difficult, so I'm not particularly inclined to try to understand them."
6163,103,1,30,ISTP,43,"<neutrality>  Depending on the mood of the day without the public, there are times when you contact me first, and there are times when you contact me."
6164,103,1,30,ISTP,44,"<no>  Rather than trying to go back to the original plan, if the plan goes wrong, I tend to find another way."
6165,103,1,30,ISTP,45,<Yes>  I regret the past days when I neglected my health care and spent too much money.
6166,103,1,30,ISTP,46,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I have a lot of questions about these topics, but I've never thought deeply about them because there's no set answer."
6167,103,1,30,ISTP,47,"<Yes>  Even if I try to control my emotions, I tend to show off a lot on the outside, so it seems that I have lived my life without thinking that I have to control my emotions at some point, and people around me usually see it that way."
6168,103,1,30,ISTP,48,"<no>  Because even if the other person's fault is obvious, if I feel offended, it seems that I think of my feelings first rather than the other person's face."
6181,104,1,40,ESTJ,1,"<no>  When I have a lot of things to do or when I'm busy, I completely take a dive from my friends around me because I'm busy, so I look for friends when my friends leave and one day I suddenly have time and feel lonely."
6182,104,1,40,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  I am looking for another route because I can't do anything because real estate is regulated, and I am looking for a next-generation sideline due to the congestion of data labels."
6183,104,1,40,ESTJ,3,"<Yes> Even though I'm crying without knowing, am I crying like this? Am I stressed out? And so on, I think of various reasons, and when I am with others, I avoid the seat or create other situations in order not to show myself."
6184,104,1,40,ESTJ,4,"<no>  I have the confidence that I am perfect at what I do, so I don't think I'll fail."
6185,104,1,40,ESTJ,5,"<Yes> Recently, there was a national certification exam. With 6 people watching my work, there was a feeling of pressure to the point where my heart would burst, but I feel joy in seeing myself achieve my work in that process, so I enjoy it."
6186,104,1,40,ESTJ,6,"<no>  I like talking to new people. Being with a close person gives you peace of mind, but starting a new story is also interesting."
6187,104,1,40,ESTJ,7,"<Yes> In the case of labeling, if I do this and then that, I can't concentrate well. Rather, I feel like I'm just hovering around the outside. Unconditionally, it stands up after this is over."
6188,104,1,40,ESTJ,8,"<no>  Very rational. Even though I cry really sadly, I think about why I am crying, and when it snows, I think that I have to get out quickly because the road is blocked."
6189,104,1,40,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  Even if the family went to the pension for 2 days and 1 night, they looked around on time, ate on time, and so on. We research in advance and let you know the schedule on your mobile phone before departure."
6190,104,1,40,ESTJ,10,"<Yes>  I was disqualified within an hour of starting the Architectural Skills Test. It wasn't a very important certification, and I should do it again next time, but after being disqualified, there was a collapse of self-esteem, wondering if I'm getting older and falling behind like this."
6191,104,1,40,ESTJ,11,"<no>  am always interested in new environments and new people. I greet them with a smile first and start by saying that I have been interested in them for a while. If it's like a parent's meeting, did you come alone? I came alone and it was a little strange, but seeing it earlier, it seemed like I came alone. You must be the same age as me, right? and come naturally."
6192,104,1,40,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  In short, I am not interested. Rather than abstract things, I pay attention to the realistic things I can touch."
6193,104,1,40,ESTJ,13,<Yes> Emotions can change at any time. I always think that being rational is realistic. I often hear people say that I am not very affectionate.
6194,104,1,40,ESTJ,14,"<no>  Rather than improvising, I proceed in the order I wake up in the morning and when I have time, I do impromptu things that I thought of earlier. If I suddenly feel the urge to go to the mountains while working at home, I hurry up and finish what I can."
6195,104,1,40,ESTJ,15,"<no> focus on outcome Do you think she is an ajumma spread around the house? Rather, what is the matter?"
6196,104,1,40,ESTJ,16,<Yes>  Doesn't like being alone. It is good to have several people together. It seeks the safety of the many rather than the insecurity of the few.
6197,104,1,40,ESTJ,17,<Yes>  I hate the series so much. I am very curious and frustrated when I see a book or movie that leaves questions about the ending.
6198,104,1,40,ESTJ,18,"<no>  I have a lot of greed. No matter how close you are, if you do better than me, your stomach hurts. Of course, I feel proud when I help and become better than that person now, but I can't allow myself to become better than myself."
6199,104,1,40,ESTJ,19,"<Yes> There are many questions. I have an appointment and I'm going to meet someone at a coffee shop in an apartment complex, and on the way, when I see a store doing interior work, I go in and ask the people who are under construction. What's in here? It's fortunate to hear that it's ooo, but if you don't know, go to a nearby real estate and ask again. There are times when I forget that I was going to the coffee shop because I had an appointment."
6200,104,1,40,ESTJ,20,"<Yes> Her self-esteem began to decline as her self-confidence, which she had when she was a senior manager of a well-known conglomerate, changed to being a housewife. At that time, I had no doubts about my decision and my actions, and I was confident, but now that I am at home, I am starting to doubt my judgment."
6201,104,1,40,ESTJ,21,"<Yes>  I felt that the more I became a leader, the more pressure I felt. I already felt that leaders are always having a hard time, not only at the company but also at private gatherings. During my social life, I realized that being a staff member right under the leader is comfortable."
6202,104,1,40,ESTJ,22,"<Yes> Art sees creation and creativity as important. It's really easy to look at something and make it the same or similar or draw it. But it's too hard to draw something that doesn't exist. Cooking is also creative. Even if you follow the recipe, some people make it delicious and some people don't. I like to be precise, so if I follow the recipe, it works perfectly. If you don't have a recipe, you won't be able to figure out what to put in and how much, even if it's close to 50."
6203,104,1,40,ESTJ,23,"<no> If there are only people who value rationality, it seems that humanity will disappear in the world. It's like living a life like a robot. When I see an elderly woman who is a bit nervous while passing by, I think the world will be warmer only when there are more people helping her by asking why she is like that than me passing by because I can't delay because of the contract."
6204,104,1,40,ESTJ,24,"<Yes> On days when I go home after staying up all night and the dishes are not cleaned up and the dishes are piled up, I keep getting worried about what I have to do after waking up while I sleep. That's why you can't rest. In the end, even if I only slept for 10 minutes, it became more restful to finish all the housework and go to sleep."
6205,104,1,40,ESTJ,25,"<Yes>  I am very curious about what other people think and do differently from me. Whether it was an argument or a fight, I learned a lot by listening to different actions and thoughts that differed from mine."
6206,104,1,40,ESTJ,26,"<Yes>  I think getting attention is being the person who elicits expectations. I hate the pressure of that expectation. As if trying to be directly under the leader is the reason, I don't like being in the spotlight because it puts a heavy burden on my shoulders."
6207,104,1,40,ESTJ,27,"<no> It is common to see that when mothers scold their children, they fight together rather than discipline them. If there is something wrong with my husband or children, I get angry and do not blame them. If you start off angry, your emotions explode quickly."
6208,104,1,40,ESTJ,28,"<Yes> Buy vegetables from ku 0, fruits from g0, etc. With decades of purchasing know-how, you don't go around much anymore and just go to a place where the awareness of the product is good. I roam the wide Internet sea, sleep, and roam again the next day,, I think time is more wasteful than 10 won."
6209,104,1,40,ESTJ,29,"<no>  If I can't finish it in advance, I'm not comfortable with it, so I can't procrastinate. If I have to postpone it, I have already completed the parts I am not confident about."
6210,104,1,40,ESTJ,30,"<no> The world after death can only be known after death, and the time now is more important and precious. I don't feel sorry for what I can't change anyway."
6211,104,1,40,ESTJ,31,"<Yes>  I spend a lot of time alone. I don't know when I'm busy, but when I'm alone, I feel a lot of loneliness. It's so sad to be lonely..."
6212,104,1,40,ESTJ,32,"<Yes> When I go to the Daehae entrance exam briefing session, they always say the same thing. Read what was written in PPT. If you're going to read it as it is, don't just distribute the data. Why are you asking me to come... I'm curious about the exceptional story."
6213,104,1,40,ESTJ,33,<no>  People who grew up in poverty completely agree with the saying that they are greedy and insidious. People who grew up poor don't know how to give and take receiving for granted. It is completely exclusive to such selfishness.
6214,104,1,40,ESTJ,34,"<Yes> Even if I'm already certain of my decision, I wait until the deadline. Because something else might happen in the meantime... A warning to your husband or children?"
6215,104,1,40,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  I believe in my decisions myself because I think that wasting time trying to do something that can't be reversed is more wasteful, and there are many things that I'm right about the decisions I make at work or at home."
6216,104,1,40,ESTJ,36,"<neutrality>  like my alone time, but I feel lonely when I am alone all the time. At times like these, it's better to spend a lot of time with a group of people and then come back alone."
6217,104,1,40,ESTJ,37,"<no>  I think it's a luxury. It's what people who are bored with a lot of time and money do. Also, I myself don't know much about art."
6218,104,1,40,ESTJ,38,<Yes>  He lied to me about nothing. why do you lie He said he did it because he thought I wouldn't get angry if I said that. I'm more angry at lying.
6219,104,1,40,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  Organize what you have to do tomorrow or today the day before or in the morning, and want it to go on as it is, and try to make it happen."
6220,104,1,40,ESTJ,40,<Yes>  I think my judgment and my thoughts are correct. I don't regret my judgment in my life so far.
6221,104,1,40,ESTJ,41,<Yes>  I don't want to waste time talking on the phone if I don't need it right away.
6222,104,1,40,ESTJ,42,"<Yes> Especially when I talk to my little one, he really seems like a kid from a completely different world. They come up with answers you hadn't thought of. When I get angry at the moment, the child closes his mouth. So what would it be like to do this now? Why do you think so? What does your mother think? While continuing to ask questions, the child chose a way to solve it by talking about his thoughts. I've done it for 3 hours without a break."
6223,104,1,40,ESTJ,43,"<no> Usually friends or older sisters contact me first. I'm not the first to contact him, but when he does, I'm the first to say, ""Let's have a cup of coffee later."" I know that networking is a line that can never be ignored."
6224,104,1,40,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  I have an appointment at 2 o'clock, but I left the paperwork at home. If I go and bring it, it takes time, so even if I waste money, I use the fastest quick."
6225,104,1,40,ESTJ,45,<no>  don't want to fail my life by admitting that. I think about it with doubts that my judgment was right at the time and what would have happened if I had just thought in a different direction.
6226,104,1,40,ESTJ,46,<Yes>  It's what people who have nothing to do and are full think about. I have no choice but to fight and compromise with reality in order to go to a better and higher place from where I am now.
6227,104,1,40,ESTJ,47,"<no>  saw a lot of people who lost money because they couldn¡¯t control their emotions. Especially angry people.. I try to maintain a neutral state as much as possible. How did you behave in that situation? There are times when I hear people say, ¡°Wow, that¡¯s great.¡±"
6228,104,1,40,ESTJ,48,"<Yes>  I don't try to get rid of my mistakes, but I tend to draw the conclusion that I made mistakes, but I had no choice but to do so. I think that if I give, I will receive help later."
6241,105,1,30,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality>  tend to make new friends when given a new environment. Other than that, I don't make new friends on a regular basis."
6242,105,1,30,ESTJ,2,<neutrality>  I tend to explore when interests arise and I find something I want to know about. Doesn't take a lot of time.
6243,105,1,30,ESTJ,3,"<no>  I easily empathize with other people's feelings and don't cry with them. Even if other people are crying, there are many times when we just pass by."
6244,105,1,30,ESTJ,4,<Yes>  have a lot of thoughts and I tend to come up with several plans in advance when things go wrong.
6245,105,1,30,ESTJ,5,"<Yes>  I tend to plan things out in advance, so even when the pressure is high, I tend to think of ways to deal with it."
6246,105,1,30,ESTJ,6,<Yes>  I mostly like to talk to comfortable people. I tend not to talk to new people first.
6247,105,1,30,ESTJ,7,<Yes>  I don't see a backlog of work. Hurry up and start another project.
6248,105,1,30,ESTJ,8,"<no>  I'm not sentimental. Rather than being spontaneous or sentimental, I like to move in a planned way."
6249,105,1,30,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  Even when I go on a trip, I tend to plan in advance considering both the time, purpose, and travel time."
6250,105,1,30,ESTJ,10,"<Yes>  When I make a mistake, I tend to rethink it over and over again. I tend to doubt others, but I also doubt myself."
6251,105,1,30,ESTJ,11,<Yes>  I'm not the type to be hard on people. It is easy to talk to the person you are interested in first.
6252,105,1,30,ESTJ,12,<Yes>  I don't like multiple interpretations. I like to get the right answer.
6253,105,1,30,ESTJ,13,<Yes>  I am a person who tries not to be easily influenced by emotions. Make rational decisions and act in advance.
6254,105,1,30,ESTJ,14,<no>  I like to plan ahead and stick to a set schedule. I tend to jot down my schedule and to-dos for the day in my notebook.
6255,105,1,30,ESTJ,15,"<no>  I think and worry a lot about what kind of person I will appear to others, and I do image making."
6256,105,1,30,ESTJ,16,<Yes>  I like to be around a lot of people. I like to do group activities and mingle with people.
6257,105,1,30,ESTJ,17,"<no>  I don't like multiple interpretations, I like clearly closed endings. I hate movies and dramas that end ambiguously."
6258,105,1,30,ESTJ,18,<no>  I am not very interested in the success of others. My success gives me a lot of satisfaction.
6259,105,1,30,ESTJ,19,<no> My interests are clearly defined and my priorities are set. I seldom know what to do because I always prioritize my to-dos and then work on them.
6260,105,1,30,ESTJ,20,"<Yes>  I have a lot of worries and thoughts, so I tend to plan ahead. I plan ahead so I'm not afraid of going wrong."
6261,105,1,30,ESTJ,21,<neutrality>  I am more than willing to take on a leadership role if the group's purpose requires it.
6262,105,1,30,ESTJ,22,<Yes>  tend to think I'm not creative. So I don't think I have any artistic inclinations.
6263,105,1,30,ESTJ,23,<neutrality>  We believe that the world will be a better place only when there are diverse people. I think both people who value emotion and people who value rationality should all get along.
6264,105,1,30,ESTJ,24,<Yes>  I have to do everything in advance so I can relax and feel good. You need to finish your chores first and relax in a tidy mood.
6265,105,1,30,ESTJ,25,"<no>  I'm not very interested in other people's affairs. I don't like situations where I feel bad by watching other people's arguments, so I often avoid them."
6266,105,1,30,ESTJ,26,<Yes>  They don't want to be noticed by others. I hate being out front.
6267,105,1,30,ESTJ,27,"<Yes>  Because the likes and dislikes are clear, emotions tend to change very quickly depending on the situation."
6268,105,1,30,ESTJ,28,<Yes>  Because you like to plan ahead and work efficiently. I want the people I work with to be well-planned and efficient.
6269,105,1,30,ESTJ,29,<no>  There were many times when I would finish work ahead of time and submit it to the deadline when the schedule approached.
6270,105,1,30,ESTJ,30,<no>  I am not interested in the afterlife. I don't even believe in an afterlife.
6271,105,1,30,ESTJ,31,"<neutrality> Time alone is important, and time with others is also important. It depends."
6272,105,1,30,ESTJ,32,<no>  I like original stories. It seems that there are many times when we talk about the original theory.
6273,105,1,30,ESTJ,33,"<no>  I can understand, but I don't want to empathize. I'm just passing it off as someone who lives in a different world from me."
6274,105,1,30,ESTJ,34,"<no>  I am usually very subjective. I tend to make decisions from the very beginning, so I don't put them off until the end."
6275,105,1,30,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  I don't want to regret and trust me, so I don't give a second thought to the decisions I've already made."
6276,105,1,30,ESTJ,36,"<no>  It depends. These days, I usually spend time outside with my family."
6277,105,1,30,ESTJ,37,"<no>  I go to exhibitions from time to time, but I'm not very interested in art or art."
6278,105,1,30,ESTJ,38,<no>  tend to try to understand other people's feelings. I have never had a hard time understanding that there are people who are different from me.

6280,105,1,30,ESTJ,40,"<no>  I tend to feel a lot of insecurity. In any situation, I imagine the outcome in many ways."
6281,105,1,30,ESTJ,41,"<neutrality>  I don't want to avoid it. However, I prefer to communicate via text."
6282,105,1,30,ESTJ,42,<no>  I don't spend a lot of time trying to understand opinions that differ from mine. Because there are people with many opinions in the world.
6283,105,1,30,ESTJ,43,"<neutrality>  Sometimes we contact each other, and it's almost half and half. When we first contact each other, we usually drive together and meet in a short time."
6284,105,1,30,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  I tend to like things to go according to plan. Plan A, B, and so on in advance."
6285,105,1,30,ESTJ,45,"<Yes>  If something similar happens again, there are times when you think back to what happened a long time ago and regret it."
6286,105,1,30,ESTJ,46,<Yes>  I don't think much of it because it's not my field of interest. We live hard because we were born.
6287,105,1,30,ESTJ,47,<neutrality>  It seems half and half. It seems that he is the type of person who is trying not to be swayed by emotions. There are times when you hear people say that you are cold.
6288,105,1,30,ESTJ,48,"<no> If it's the other person's fault, I want them to admit it, apologize, and make amends. I don't think face is important."
6301,106,1,30,ENTJ,1,<Yes>  I like activities where I meet and talk with various people. I think it's because I get close quickly with people I meet for the first time and I have a lot of curiosity about people.
6302,106,1,30,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  seem to spend more than an hour a day exploring my interests. These days, my interests are psychological counseling and financial technology. I am interested in psychological counseling because I have a lot of interest in people, so I am studying it."
6303,106,1,30,ENTJ,3,"<neutrality>  It depends. If you can logically understand what that person is saying, you want to cry together, but if you don't understand why you don't understand, point by point."
6304,106,1,30,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  have a plan, but I think things might go wrong, so I tend to come up with some contingency plans."
6305,106,1,30,ENTJ,5,"<Yes>  Since I have a social life, there are many times when I have to maintain my composure, so I try to do my best. The reason is that it is difficult to live a social life if you do not maintain composure. Not long ago, the team leader often put pressure on performance at the company, so I was mentally tired and dissatisfied, but I solved it by talking around it with a smile."
6306,106,1,30,ENTJ,6,"<no>  I like to meet a lot of new people. The reason is that each person has a different way of thinking, so it's fun to get to know them. It's good to have a lot of people around. My job is as an instructor. It's a job where there are a lot of new people, so I enjoy talking and leading while working."
6307,106,1,30,ENTJ,7,"<Yes>  When I do a project, I make a plan and try to execute it according to the plan. The reason is that I have a plan, but if it doesn't go according to plan, I feel anxious. There was an order from the top to proceed with several projects at the same time, but they were implemented together at once. When I did that, I couldn't concentrate, so time took its toll, and the quality of the project fell."
6308,106,1,30,ENTJ,8,"<no>  I don't think I'm very sentimental. The reason seems to be that when I go to see a sad movie or a play with my friends, I am less moved than other people."
6309,106,1,30,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  like to plan with a schedule or list. The reason is that it is easier to achieve your goals if you have a plan in place. That's why I often make plans at the beginning of the year or at the end of the year, and I always write down planners on my smartphone."
6310,106,1,30,ENTJ,10,"<Yes>  tend to doubt my ability or knowledge even for small mistakes. I think the reason is because I tend to be fully aware of and execute when I'm working on something. Recently, a child asked a question about the capital of the country. It was the capital I knew, but suddenly I couldn't think of it, so I talked about the capital of another country."
6311,106,1,30,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  think I am interested in people. So I approach the other person and start the story by telling a general (common interest) story. When giving a lecture, there are people standing in the hallway of the lecture hall. At that time, I went to the side and asked what was the reason. And I explained the contents of my lecture and explained other lectures."
6312,106,1,30,ENTJ,12,<Yes>  I am not interested in discussing the various interpretations of works of art. This is because art is subjective and abstract.
6313,106,1,30,ENTJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. The evaluations around it seem to be similar. Emotional types say that when people see you, they don't like you. When the child had an argument with a friend, the child was upset and crying. Listening to the situation, it seemed that the child had done something wrong. The child seemed to be asking for recognition and understanding of his feelings, but when he told her what was wrong, he cried even more."
6314,106,1,30,ENTJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan my day. The reason is that it is good to have a schedule for the day as well. For example, when I go on a trip, I tend to organize my movements according to the time. Because that way you don't waste your time."
6315,106,1,30,ENTJ,15,"<Yes>  I don't worry about what other people think of me. The reason is that most people like and follow me. During the lecture, he listens to me and nods his head, and even after the lecture is over, he seems to want to come up to me and ask me various questions and talk with me. Judging from that, I don't worry because many people seem to view me favorably."
6316,106,1,30,ENTJ,16,<Yes>  I enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is because I get to know various people and get energy for life through them. That's why I go to church diligently and actively participate in women's civic group activities.
6317,106,1,30,ENTJ,17,<Yes>  I like books and movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. The reason is that the ending that I don't understand is going on and it's so frustrating. My recent favorite work is Minari.
6318,106,1,30,ENTJ,18,<no>  I find no greater satisfaction in helping others succeed than I do myself. The reason is because it's important for me to succeed. It is better for me to succeed and help many people than for me to help others succeed.
6319,106,1,30,ENTJ,19,<Yes>  have so many interests that sometimes I don't know which one to start with. The reason is because there are many questions about the world. I've been thinking about what to do for my hobbies these days. So I searched and made a list. I'm still thinking about it because I can't choose.
6320,106,1,30,ENTJ,20,"<no>  I'm not the type to worry about things going wrong. The reason is that I tend to go ahead as planned and check in between, so my plans don't go wrong."
6321,106,1,30,ENTJ,21,"<no>  like being in a leadership role in a group. The reason is because I like to harmonize with people and lead groups. So, whenever a meeting is held, I act as secretary or president."
6322,106,1,30,ENTJ,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason was that I had memories of not being good at music, art, and physical education during my school days. I went to an academy, but I remember that it was not fun. I am more comfortable thinking mechanically than thinking creatively."
6323,106,1,30,ENTJ,23,<neutrality>  I don't think the world would have been a better place if people had valued reason over emotion. The reason is that I think that it is not good to lean too far in either direction.
6324,106,1,30,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  tend to finish my chores first before taking a break. The reason is that you can rest comfortably when it is well cleaned. I have work to do, but if I take a break, I can't take a break because I care about work."
6325,106,1,30,ENTJ,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that you can share various thoughts. It's because when you share various thoughts, a better agenda comes out."
6326,106,1,30,ENTJ,26,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to avoid attracting other people's attention, nor am I the type that doesn't. Because I'm different depending on the situation. That's why I tend to step out when I need to draw attention, and I don't think I'm the type to step out when it's not. When there is a situation where other people need attention, I do not dare to step forward."
6327,106,1,30,ENTJ,27,"<neutrality>  My feelings don't change very quickly, but each situation is different. For example, there was a situation where a child made a mistake and was angry, but suddenly laughed when the child said something outrageous."
6328,106,1,30,ENTJ,28,"<neutrality> Sometimes I get annoyed when I see someone who isn't as effective as I am, sometimes not. I think the reason is that each person has a different way of thinking. But I get annoyed when I see people who are not effective outside of common sense. I get annoyed when I see people who insist on following the plan without recognizing that there are times when the order of work has to change."
6329,106,1,30,ENTJ,29,"<no>  tend to get things done as quickly as possible. The reason is because I want to finish quickly and rest. It's been too hard since I went to work recently, but I wanted to take a break while looking at the piled up housework, but I cleaned up and rested first."
6330,106,1,30,ENTJ,30,"<no>  I am not interested in questions about the afterlife. The reason is that I am not interested in it because it is difficult to live right now, and it does not seem to be a topic that will help me."
6331,106,1,30,ENTJ,31,<neutrality>  preferred spending time with others rather than alone. The reason is because you receive energy by spending it with people. But I've been so run over by people lately that I want to spend some time alone.
6332,106,1,30,ENTJ,32,"<Yes>  am not very interested in theory-oriented discussions. The reason is that theory and reality are too different. For example, many part-time jobs should be created for women who have had career breaks. That way more people can work. The government is talking about it, but I think it is a loss for companies. If you create a lot of part-time jobs, I think it's difficult because you have to do everything from salary transfer to the 4 major insurances twice, and you have to teach the job twice."
6333,106,1,30,ENTJ,33,"<neutrality>  can easily relate to people from completely different backgrounds than mine, and sometimes I don't. It depends. Even if the background is different from mine, if you explain the situation well, you can understand and empathize."
6334,106,1,30,ENTJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to put off making decisions until the last minute. The reason is that we look for information to the end and decide comprehensively. For example, even when choosing a travel destination, we make a decision by looking through the information."
6335,106,1,30,ENTJ,35,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I think about the decisions I've already made and other times I don't. In the past, I used to think a lot, but now that I have a social life, I get a lot of stress when I think about it, so I don't just think about it. But sometimes when I make a decision I regret, I will think about it and not do it next time. I think."
6336,106,1,30,ENTJ,36,<Yes>  I tend to relieve stress and fatigue by having fun with other people. I used to meet and talk about video conference because I couldn't meet well with Corona.
6337,106,1,30,ENTJ,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. Works of art are subjective and abstract, so even if you go and see them, they don't touch your heart."
6338,106,1,30,ENTJ,38,"<Yes>  I often find it difficult to understand other people's feelings. The reason is that rational thoughts come first. For example, when a child is emotionally sad, we try to understand the cause and effect relationship."
6339,106,1,30,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  like to plan my daily to-dos. This is because it saves time and makes it easier to keep track of what you did today. Even when dealing with personal or business matters, I tend to make plans."
6340,106,1,30,ENTJ,40,"<no>  There are times when I feel insecure. No matter how much you plan and think, there are times when things don't go according to plan. Every time that happens, I feel insecure."
6341,106,1,30,ENTJ,41,"<no>  like to talk on the phone. I also love talking on the phone because I love interacting, talking and getting to know people."
6342,106,1,30,ENTJ,42,"<no>  I do not try to understand your opinion because I think it is not reasonable and not valid to disagree with me. Still, I try to listen and understand other opinions."
6343,106,1,30,ENTJ,43,"<Yes>  tend to contact my friends to meet up first. The reason is that it is not difficult to approach first. I also like meeting people, so I tend to contact them first."
6344,106,1,30,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback in my plan, I tend to try to execute it according to the plan as much as possible. I recently had a trip planned, but it was in danger of being canceled due to another friend's circumstances. The trip was planned, so my friend couldn't go and I went alone."
6345,106,1,30,ENTJ,45,<no>  I rarely regret my mistakes long ago. The reason is because it is useless even if you regret it now. I just admit it because I can't turn back time.
6346,106,1,30,ENTJ,46,<no>  I tend not to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. The reason is that there are so many challenges ahead that there is no time to think.
6347,106,1,30,ENTJ,47,"<no>  I think you need to control your emotions well. The reason is that when emotions rise, we call attention and try to judge rationally. I hear people around me sometimes say that they don't seem to have a degree."
6348,106,1,30,ENTJ,48,"<no>  If it's clear that it's the other person's fault, I say it on the spot. The reason is because you need to know. Face is the other person's situation."
6361,107,1,40,ESTP,1,"<Yes>  I don't try, but I tend to make friends naturally and periodically. Even if I stay still, there are more cases where my opponent comes to me. It is not uncomfortable or burdensome to meet new people and carry on a conversation."
6362,107,1,40,ESTP,2,"<Yes>  tend to spend time exploring various interests. I mainly subscribe to education, self-development, real estate, financial technology, and religion (Christianity) channels through YouTube, but the channel I devote the most to is about children's education."
6363,107,1,40,ESTP,3,"<neutrality>  No matter what situation it is, positive or negative, I tend to face reality without avoiding it. It is my way to stay silent by the side. Instead of handing over a tissue and trying to comfort him, he stays neutral until he shakes off all his emotions."
6364,107,1,40,ESTP,4,"<Yes>  It's very like that. Even if you are not prepared, half a day or a day is enough to make the next plan. Once the plan is in place, it is put into action."
6365,107,1,40,ESTP,5,"<neutrality> If there is a lot of pressure, it sometimes shows in the complexion, so I give myself enough time to empty my feelings about me. Because we have religion, we pray and listen to praise. Bookstores and movie theaters crowded with people rather focus on me."
6366,107,1,40,ESTP,6,"<Yes>  I don't have any pressure to meet new people, but as I get older, I realized that dealing with people requires energy. So, we are taking action after considering efficiency in terms of time, people, and work. However, if necessary, you can go on stage and host."
6367,107,1,40,ESTP,7,"<no>  As soon as you put rice in the pot, the dishes or cooking starts, and as soon as you contact the company by phone, you can schedule a visit and write a report to your boss soon after. However, the closer the deadline, the higher the speed and accuracy of the work."
6368,107,1,40,ESTP,8,"<no>  have no hobbies in arts and sports. I tend to think that if I shed tears, I lose, so if I feel like I'm going to turn sentimental, I go outside and walk 10,000 steps in the sunlight."
6369,107,1,40,ESTP,9,"<neutrality>  I like making plans. If you feel like you can't do it right, cancel it. Rather than a diary, these days, I use the note function on the screen of my cell phone to write down things."
6370,107,1,40,ESTP,10,"<no>  It's just a mistake. Sometimes I can't believe I made a mistake, but since it's rare, I'm content with thinking that it's human. It was to select the test date, but I mistakenly misunderstood the time zone and read it."
6371,107,1,40,ESTP,11,"<Yes>  There were many times when I practiced image making and gave lectures on it, so I did a lot of practice and theoretically know how to make a good impression."
6372,107,1,40,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  There were times when I enjoyed looking for interpretations of movies, but that was only once. I watched the movie because it was easy to enter without the need for special preparation. On the other hand, it seems that I have to spend quite a lot of time and money to understand art works or music from reading, so I don't have a step forward."
6373,107,1,40,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to think that the more I follow my emotions, the closer I am to being immature. If you think about divorce, it takes half a day to feel resentment. You make a reservation at a divorce lawyer's office for half a day, register for a job at the Women's Employment Center on the way back the next day, and participate in the employment program the next day to complete the course. At that time, they made that decision again, and they still live as a couple, but this journey is a true story."
6374,107,1,40,ESTP,14,<neutrality>  There are days when you don't want to do anything. Most of them are 40% planned in advance and 60% planned on the day.
6375,107,1,40,ESTP,15,"<Yes>  Not at all worried. The basic personality has become a whole thing that cannot be fixed, and efforts are made to supplement it according to the situation. Even so, I like people who like me, and hate people who hate me. You just have to live by looking at the people you like. Instead of a going relationship, that empty corner will soon be filled with another relationship."
6376,107,1,40,ESTP,16,"<neutrality>  I really want to participate. I don't want to force it. I want to move with my own free will. The local community reading club was like that, but the 1nd round of reading discussion, and the 2nd round of people who will go to the party."
6377,107,1,40,ESTP,17,<no>  The nuance that the ending is still not completed gives a feeling of frustration. I tend to make decisions based on reviews and ratings from critics.
6378,107,1,40,ESTP,18,"<Yes>  I did employment consulting, but I think it's very attractive to help someone overcome each stepping stone."
6379,107,1,40,ESTP,19,"<Yes>  When I learned about data labeling, I went to and from the site to see what I could do better."
6380,107,1,40,ESTP,20,"<no>  There are no cases where things go very wrong. Think about the number of cases and choose the one with the highest probability. Think carefully, make a decision and you will not regret it."
6381,107,1,40,ESTP,21,"<neutrality>  I don't want to step out and do it, but if I leave it to you, I will try to do it properly without taking it out again."
6382,107,1,40,ESTP,22,"<neutrality>  When I imitated it, I was able to do it right away. However, it is not at the level of mastery, but at the level of a light one-day class, so if you put in the time, you will be able to do it well."
6383,107,1,40,ESTP,23,"<no>  think that if it was done with reason, a war would have occurred based on practical reasons, and if it had been done with emotion, it would have caused a war of retaliation. People think they are evil."
6384,107,1,40,ESTP,24,"<no>  Before doing chores, I will eat something to conserve energy for chores, or take a full break before doing chores."
6385,107,1,40,ESTP,25,"<no>  First of all, I feel fortunate that it's not me. Watching the debate feels like an indirect experience, so I think I'll do something else."
6386,107,1,40,ESTP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to think that I shouldn't stand out, so I adjust the atmosphere and get buried in the group, but I have my own subjectivity, and when someone asks, I clearly reveal my subjectivity."
6387,107,1,40,ESTP,27,"<no>  It never changes. It was difficult to work because a former female colleague had a person who changed with every change in the weather during the magic cycle. Absolutely my will, and I enjoy taking steps to control."
6388,107,1,40,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  There was a person who didn't score a dot even if I gave it a week, but I was so calm that I wondered if it was a parachute, so I skipped lunch that day. I could have done it by changing the order of work, but I was furious that I couldn't think of it that far."
6389,107,1,40,ESTP,29,"<Yes>  I see deadlines, think of time leisurely, and only think about what to do. I have a written exam ahead of me, I applied for it a month ago, but today I read the book for the first time."
6390,107,1,40,ESTP,30,"<Yes>  Because I believe there is a heaven and a hell because I have a religion, I look into myself every day and live my life with a focus on repentant introspection. It is unthinkable that the world ends so monotonously with just one lifetime."
6391,107,1,40,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  I think it's okay to be alone these days. When I am alone, I can focus on myself and take enough rest."
6392,107,1,40,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  It's good to be able to apply it to real life. Religion is also more interested in the experience derived from it than the theory of the Bible, and it is better to obtain a practical license than a degree."
6393,107,1,40,ESTP,33,"<neutrality> It was conceited that there was no one who could not sympathize with him. There are people like that. But I decided not to try. The in-laws can only understand when they are born again. Even after saying that I thought it was her daughter, the call comes from asking if an adult called first, so I have to be born again as the daughter of that family to be able to relate to her."
6394,107,1,40,ESTP,34,"<no>  Think carefully about your decision, but avoid situations where you are forced to make a decision on time. When I make a decision, I don't regret it, I just think of the good things and move on."
6395,107,1,40,ESTP,35,"<Yes>  I do not regret thinking that I made the best choice based on experience and theory. Even if I decide on a different route, I always have regrets, so rather than rationalizing my decision, I only look at the good points and proceed. So don't overturn your decision."
6396,107,1,40,ESTP,36,"<no> Spending time alone is more comfortable. I participate in events or gatherings when I have my energy. Before getting married, I had three or four appointments a week, attended weddings and funerals unconditionally, and lived with the affinity of being able to drink a cup of coffee from the 1st floor to the 10th floor of the building I go to work, but now it is too vain. Because I have children to raise with my family, I give good quality energy to my family, and even then, I have to meet up when I am full. Only three mothers of necessary children are suitable."
6397,107,1,40,ESTP,37,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I feel like I want to go to an art gallery and appreciate the artwork. Every time that happens, I try to search the schedule, but it's practically difficult because I have young children. There are times when I just like the calm lighting and atmosphere, but there seems to be a pattern of visiting art galleries when I feel extremely stressed and then completely exhausted."
6398,107,1,40,ESTP,38,"<neutrality> It was not difficult to catch the other person's emotions. He was so skillful that he knew how to dodge in advance, prepare for it, and face it. Despite having such strengths, the reason for answering neutral is that the word ¡°neighbor cousin¡± is not widely used, and the neighbor¡¯s poker face behavior (smoking indoors, noise at night, etc.) is incomprehensible. And, while claiming to be a daughter, she asked for an obligatory phone call from her daughter-in-law, and when I encountered such attitudes as 'my son's house is also my house', 'why do you ask my daughter-in-law to confirm the schedule when I go to my son's house', buffering came. They empathize with others thoroughly, and cannot empathize with others close to them."
6399,107,1,40,ESTP,39,<Yes> It's nice to be able to spend the day in a well-structured way if you choose the amount of work you need to do each day. It's not bad to work on a project that has a deadline and works until when. Short-term plans are preferred.
6400,107,1,40,ESTP,40,"<Yes>  tend to be consistent in my emotions. It's not innate, it's like I trained myself. Subscribe to my religion-related YouTube channel, watch videos that suit me by keyword search, or go to a bookstore to find a book, get plenty of sunlight during the day, and walk 10,000 steps while listening to praise. And pray in the middle of the night When I can contemplate my feelings to some extent, I meet acquaintances and convey good energy."
6401,107,1,40,ESTP,41,"<no> Phone calls are more comfortable than exchanging social media. It is difficult to think and translate the words to be thought of because you have to think about the wording of the person who is trying to read it. It's hard to hand over business, and I'm tired of having to make up conversations."
6402,107,1,40,ESTP,42,"<no> Even if I spend time, I don't see communication as the answer to my own change or problem solving. Things change only when we change together, but there were many cases where I was a single-minded person. However, I cannot teach the subject, and I do not think I have the qualifications or rights to do so. Leaving it alone is my own respect, thinking that I have to tear it off and fix it is violence and arrogance in itself, so I leave it alone until I realize that the more angular the stone, the more affectionate it is."
6403,107,1,40,ESTP,43,"<Yes> If you just call and ask to meet, I'll go, or you'll come from there. Even if you don't keep in touch often, your current friend is in a relationship of trust, so even if you live in a distant province, you send gifticons on birthdays or children's vacations and ask how they are doing."
6404,107,1,40,ESTP,44,"<Yes> Instead, it is to set a goal different from the primary goal, but the same goal is already difficult to achieve. I plan to get as close as possible. For example, during the Moon Jae-in administration, I sold my house to make a subscription and lived in a private house, but the number fell, and the house I stayed at was at a time when the market price rose 1.5 times. So, by calculating the maximum amount of money and the proportion of loans that are not too much for one's income, the metropolitan area search and apartment subscription that matched the market price were carried out without omission, and after the results, the subscription for public apartments for sale was won. I am looking forward to it because I will receive an apartment sale at the market price of three years ago, and I will soon proceed with the naming of the apartment construction company, and it will rebound with the surrounding market price."
6405,107,1,40,ESTP,45,"<no> No regrets. It must have been a decision made at the time when I thoroughly considered it, listened to advice from people around me, and met alone with me, and it would be the same even if I went back."
6406,107,1,40,ESTP,46,"<no> You can think of it in conjunction with religion. Since my values are closely related to religion, I have a firm belief in the relationship between God and creation and the afterlife. I experienced a complete change in my tendency or perspective to doubt about the invisible. We can think of supernatural expressions such as 'possessed acting', 'inspired', and 'not good sixth sense' that we implicitly talk about. There is an old man who pours out all sorts of curses and violence on his family, nurses, and patients in the ward before dying in a hospital, and there is an old man who looks back on his life with tears in his eyes and dies peacefully in a hospital room. In the end, if we are an empty vessel, it is important what we put in it, and we must constantly think about what is put in it."
6407,107,1,40,ESTP,47,"<no>  subscribe to YouTube channels for religion, psychological counseling, and self-development, and read books regularly, so I tend to check and control myself. 'You have to grow to be successful. You have to introspect to grow.' People around me recommend me to drink alone or want to drink alone, but whenever I see myself walking in the sunlight or saying that I am a bookstore, I have a lot of reputations for 'great', followed by 'well done', and the question of 'where are you today' this is next And I pray every night"
6408,107,1,40,ESTP,48,"<no> Now, he restrains his emotions and delivers only the facts. Or talk to a middle manager. If you try to save face, you pass over the problem without solving it correctly, or even rationalize your mistake next time with a clumsy point."
6421,108,1,30,INTJ,1,"<no>  I have a hard time interacting with new people. I have very few friends. I have no experience, so I have nothing to write about."
6422,108,1,30,INTJ,2,"<no>  On days off, I stay at home and continue to work. If it's something I'm interested in, it's my job. The more work you create as a freelancer, the more."
6423,108,1,30,INTJ,3,"<neutrality>  It depends on my relationship with that person. If it's not mine, I'm not interested. There are times when I'm in a bad mood or when things are not right, but I usually feel nothing even when I cry."
6424,108,1,30,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to prepare for bad situations. I want to avoid the worst. As a result, I usually think negative thoughts first and prepare for them."
6425,108,1,30,INTJ,5,"<no>  It may seem so on the outside, but it becomes sensitive due to tremendous stress and brain activity. The range of emotions is large, goes up quickly and goes down quickly. I get angry quickly, but I quickly find my cool. The range of emotional temperature is very large. For example, it's a psychological fight."
6426,108,1,30,INTJ,6,"<neutrality> When I feel that I have a lot to gain, I go out. But if you think otherwise, stay quietly among my people. There is no particular reason. It seems that only the thought of wanting to do so remains"
6427,108,1,30,INTJ,7,"<neutrality>  In order to utilize the time, I change things according to the situation according to the situation. A person should make good use of the situation."
6428,108,1,30,INTJ,8,"<Yes>  There are many tears and the range of emotions is very wide. It is clear that he is angry and happy, but he tends to restrain himself due to the environment."
6429,108,1,30,INTJ,9,"<neutrality>  Usually, I just kept a brief record on the electronic device and recalled close plans so as not to forget. I tend to keep using my hair like that."
6430,108,1,30,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  I always think so. I'm on the side of trying to tighten myself up and develop. When they receive a claim, they are very responsive and care about it. For example, when working."
6431,108,1,30,INTJ,11,"<Yes>  I like what I like, I hate what I don't like. I tend to show off and express myself clearly. This is especially true in human relationships. However, in social life, he tends to maintain neutrality."
6432,108,1,30,INTJ,12,"<neutrality> If you are interested in a work, you are very interested. Materials that are interesting to you are always enjoyable. I am more interested in something related to philosophy than works of art. If a work of art has such a meaning, I think I will probably talk a lot about it."
6433,108,1,30,INTJ,13,"<neutrality>  If you look into the evaluations of the people around you or your own mind, it will show, but you tend to reduce the range a lot. Emotions took precedence in the past, but now I tend to value courtesy and face."
6434,108,1,30,INTJ,14,"<no>  I tend to do image training for the next day¡¯s plans before going to sleep. It's not a plan, it's a habit. Sometimes I do it spontaneously. However, even at that moment, it seems that improvisation is not improvisation, as it immediately checks the distance and time from this place and decides on a better place."
6435,108,1,30,INTJ,15,"<Yes>  The reason is a lot of age and face, and the influence of parents is big. I have learned not to live by avoiding others. In the past, I saw someone who had done nothing wrong apologize for my careless actions. I hate being unfair. But it made him feel bad. I remember hating it so much."
6436,108,1,30,INTJ,16,"<neutrality> It's fun and fun, but I'm tired and I want to go home quickly. I feel like I'm being robbed of people. don't enjoy it In group life, if it's not work, it's usually quiet in the corner."
6437,108,1,30,INTJ,17,<no>  I like a cool cider rather than an open ending. I haven't been able to do it lately because I've been busy with cultural life. It's not always easy to come up with something you like.
6438,108,1,30,INTJ,18,"<no> If it wasn't for me, it would all be just stomachaches. If you are a greedy person, it is normal to want more of your own success. I am greedy."
6439,108,1,30,INTJ,19,<no>  My goal is always one. My steps to get there are clumsy.
6440,108,1,30,INTJ,20,"<Yes>  Because I always think about and prepare for bad situations, I always worry and try to predict when I am faced with a new situation."
6441,108,1,30,INTJ,21,"<neutrality> If it's necessary, if it's a good situation for me, I can be a leader. you can do it"
6442,108,1,30,INTJ,22,"<no>  My current job is art-related. If I didn't think it was there, I wouldn't have tried it at all."
6443,108,1,30,INTJ,23,"<no> Because I have emotions, I feel various emotions and think that new things are created. For evolution, emotions are both a necessary problem and a solution. Emotions are very important products. I think there is a double-edged sword in everything. I think living thanks to that is fun."
6444,108,1,30,INTJ,24,<no>  I think cleaning should be done when it feels necessary. busy. I hate the feeling of being wasted. I always feel that I want to live as hard as I was born. That's why I hate rounding around. Let's fix it right away.
6445,108,1,30,INTJ,25,"<neutrality>  I enjoy it when the person I'm arguing with relates to me. If not, it's just annoying. out of interest."
6446,108,1,30,INTJ,26,"<neutrality>  When I do something that is not perfect, I tend to keep quiet. However, if I am confident, I want to show off. I felt from my actions that being a servant comes from confidence."
6447,108,1,30,INTJ,27,"<no>  I'm trying to be flexible, but the back end is long. Residual feelings from the past continue to persist."
6448,108,1,30,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  I pretend not to, but it is very frustrating. When I see part-timers who work inflexibly in the same way several times, I can't stand it and replace them."
6449,108,1,30,INTJ,29,<no>  Doing it quickly is convenient and the right way to do the next job again.
6450,108,1,30,INTJ,30,"<Yes>  Very interesting. It must also be acknowledged that the invisible exists. Believing only what you can see ends there, and logically predicting, guessing, and researching what the middle road will be like when you look at the front and back holes is judged to be more than that. Wouldn't it be the expansion of human evolution to be able to recognize beyond the universe or the afterlife and look at it from a wider perspective?"
6451,108,1,30,INTJ,31,"<no>  I'm always comfortable alone Alone time calms me down. These days, I am forced to do social activities."
6452,108,1,30,INTJ,32,"<no>  If it's a subject I'm interested in, I'm not bored at all. But if it's a topic that doesn't interest me at the time, I feel like I can't hear the sound in my ears. For example, as in the question above, if it's interesting, say a lot and your eyes will sparkle around you."
6453,108,1,30,INTJ,33,<neutrality>  Not a complete sympathy. It's just that it's open enough to be able to do that. I don't think you need to pretend to empathize and understand deeply. You just have to accept it.
6454,108,1,30,INTJ,34,"<neutrality>  If I am not sure about the information I have perceived myself, I look into it more, and if not, I tend to make a decision on the spot."
6455,108,1,30,INTJ,35,"<neutrality>  am also human and sometimes I look back and regret. Everyone will probably say no, but there will always be regrets when thinking about that time."
6456,108,1,30,INTJ,36,"<no>  Isn't the most comfortable time in the world when I'm alone, when I'm lying in the cool shade with my mom?"
6457,108,1,30,INTJ,37,<no>  I don't have that hobby yet. I like sports more than static hobbies. I don't want to see a work of art. Just thinking about it is boring and uninteresting.
6458,108,1,30,INTJ,38,"<neutrality> If it's hard to understand, don't try to understand. I just accept that it can be. I honestly get angry when they treat me as an emotional dumpster."
6459,108,1,30,INTJ,39,<Yes>  I like the feeling of accomplishment when I have something to do and have it done. I tend to be happy about making money and being needed.
6460,108,1,30,INTJ,40,<no>  The one who complains a lot of anxiety seems to have a big impact from accidents in the past. It's a kind of trauma.
6461,108,1,30,INTJ,41,<no>  think it's just a matter of doing what the phone number is. There are so many things in the world that are harder than that.
6462,108,1,30,INTJ,42,"<no>  Sometimes you may get angry and angry, but think that it is the result of different thoughts in different environments and spend more time accepting it. Because I know that thoughts, feelings and people cannot be easily changed."
6463,108,1,30,INTJ,43,"<no>  It doesn't matter if we don't meet. When I become an adult, I think it's great that I'm not pressured by my own life. No news is good news."
6464,108,1,30,INTJ,44,"<Yes>  Dreaming of quick recovery and reversal, always looking for a way and getting advice. I really want to know what to do if I don't go back. I should"
6465,108,1,30,INTJ,45,"<neutrality>  Everyone has mistakes they want to undo, but they think about them less often. Current life is also busy."
6466,108,1,30,INTJ,46,"<no> It is the principle of life, and if you apply that principle in your life, you can get through it more flexibly. People need a pillar within themselves in their lives. I think it is a necessary idea to look back and organize that ego."
6467,108,1,30,INTJ,47,<neutrality>  It is too sharply divided into interested and not interested. Being swayed by emotions is probably my weakness. Even those around them say that the attitude of indifference and interest is too different.
6468,108,1,30,INTJ,48,<neutrality> It depends on what kind of existence that opponent is to me. I don't care if it doesn't interest me. It seems that my emotions are always involved in rational judgment.
6481,109,1,30,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality>  If there is a meeting or opportunity in the field of interest, I participate and make it, but I do not make it because I am not interested in other fields."
6482,109,1,30,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, when it comes to personal colors, I'm most interested in makeup-related fields, and celebrities-related fields are the second area of interest."
6483,109,1,30,ESTJ,3,"<neutrality>  If you are a person I like and I understand the situation accurately, I want to cry, but if even one thing is not fulfilled, I will not cry."
6484,109,1,30,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  To prepare for an unexpected situation, you should always think about how to deal with it and proceed with the work to feel relieved."
6485,109,1,30,ESTJ,5,"<Yes>  recently had a problem with the company and there was a lot of mental pressure, but I had the experience of maintaining my composure and researching and finding out what kind of solution there was."
6486,109,1,30,ESTJ,6,"<neutrality>  It's not difficult for me to approach first, but if you know someone, it's better to have a conversation with them."
6487,109,1,30,ESTJ,7,"<neutrality>  It's good to do the next one after completing one project, but in reality, I'm working on multiple projects, so I'm doing it deliberately."
6488,109,1,30,ESTJ,8,"<no>  I saw the sky on my way home from work with my co-workers, and when I heard that the twinkling stars were so pretty, I thoughtlessly said that it was not an artificial satellite."
6489,109,1,30,ESTJ,9,"<neutrality>  When I work at a company, I like to set up a schedule and do it in a planned way, and I usually keep it in my head and do it as a memory. Never had a problem with either."
6490,109,1,30,ESTJ,10,"<no>  small mistake is a style that everyone thinks can be made, and a small mistake does not spread to a large extent in terms of ability or knowledge."
6491,109,1,30,ESTJ,11,"<Yes>  Since it is a person-to-person conversation, there was no difficulty in starting a conversation if you were polite and respectful while observing general courtesy."
6492,109,1,30,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  Since I have no interest in art works, I am not very interested in discussing them or not, and I do not care what kind of evaluation comes out."
6493,109,1,30,ESTJ,13,"<Yes>  If you proceed emotionally, you will lose your objective perspective, so you have the idea that you will be wrong, and the evaluations around you are similar."
6494,109,1,30,ESTJ,14,"<no>  If I improvise, I feel like I'm going to live inefficiently. When I travel, I prefer to plan my itinerary for each day."
6495,109,1,30,ESTJ,15,"<Yes>  think it is inevitable to evaluate people around me in my life, and if the evaluation is good, I think that it is good, and if it is bad, there is nothing good at all."
6496,109,1,30,ESTJ,16,"<Yes>  I like to belong to a group and share with people while doing assignments or meetings. So far, we are maintaining meetings such as the National Territorial Campaign, college clubs, former company team meetings, favorite celebrity fan meetings, and rural volunteer activities."
6497,109,1,30,ESTJ,17,"<neutrality> As for movies, I like all genres except for the comic genre, so it doesn't matter whether it's a set ending or an open ending."
6498,109,1,30,ESTJ,18,"<no>  If success is the standard, I think my success is more important. I can help others achieve success, but I don't feel satisfied with the sacrifice."
6499,109,1,30,ESTJ,19,"<no>  Because my interests are fixed, I know about the future work."
6500,109,1,30,ESTJ,20,"<neutrality> When it comes to big and important things, I worry about things going wrong, but when it comes to general things, I don't think too much about things going wrong. In case something goes wrong anyway, I would have even planned a contingency plan."
6501,109,1,30,ESTJ,21,"<neutrality>  It doesn't matter if it's an organization in a field I can be responsible for, and I prefer to do it, but I want to avoid it if it's a field I'm not confident about."
6502,109,1,30,ESTJ,22,"<neutrality>  In art, the creative part is judged to be the most important, but I think that part is lacking. However, music and art always received high marks when I was a student."
6503,109,1,30,ESTJ,23,"<Yes>  The emotional part is too subjective, so each person has a different reference point. So I think that the sesame leaf controversy or the padding controversy that is popular these days will be discussed, and if rationality was emphasized, there would be no need to argue, and I wonder if a more objective situation would be considered."
6504,109,1,30,ESTJ,24,"<Yes> It must be a situation where you were already working on something before the break, and it is comfortable to take a break after doing housework in succession. It's because I can't afford to take a break and go back to work."
6505,109,1,30,ESTJ,25,"<no>  Rather than just watching, it's more fun to participate and have an argument together. Because we can know each other's thoughts. It's just too frustrating to just watch."
6506,109,1,30,ESTJ,26,"<neutrality> At private gatherings, I tend to want attention and receive attention, and at public gatherings, I tend to just moderately express my opinions. It seems to be a difference in responsibility."
6507,109,1,30,ESTJ,27,"<no>  Nearly 95% of the people around me say that I have an okay personality, so there is no big change. Do not be emotionally agitated."
6508,109,1,30,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  Among my colleagues who work together, even if they do the same thing, they are always slow, and the way they work is so frustrating and annoying that they always teach new efficient methods."
6509,109,1,30,ESTJ,29,"<no>  If I have work to do, I tend to take care of it first and then take a break or find something else."
6510,109,1,30,ESTJ,30,<Yes>  It is interesting because there are occasional interviews with people who are curious about the mysterious field and have experienced the afterlife. I guess it's because it's something I haven't experienced.
6511,109,1,30,ESTJ,31,"<Yes> There is much more that a group can do than one can do alone. I don't like to rest at home, I like to go out for a walk."
6512,109,1,30,ESTJ,32,"<no>  I don't really like discussions, but I don't feel bored just because the topic is theory-oriented. I don't really remember the experience."
6513,109,1,30,ESTJ,33,"<neutrality>  can understand the ways of thinking and interests that other people have, but I don't tend to empathize easily. I think people's thoughts can be different, but I don't sympathize because I'm agitated. I think that's possible."
6514,109,1,30,ESTJ,34,"<no>  When given a problem, they prefer to immediately grasp the context, find a solution as quickly as possible, and then make a decision. It is judged that the more time is delayed, the worse it gets."
6515,109,1,30,ESTJ,35,"<Yes> Decisions cannot be changed unless they are in a situation where they can be reversed, so finding a solution and making a new plan are both mentally and practically efficient."
6516,109,1,30,ESTJ,36,<Yes>  I think there are many situations in which people can laugh much more than spending time alone to relieve stress.
6517,109,1,30,ESTJ,37,<no>  I have never been to an art museum except for public work because I have no interest in art. I tend to think that going to a restaurant is better.
6518,109,1,30,ESTJ,38,"<neutrality>  If it is a boundary that I can understand, I can sympathize and understand it, but if it crosses the line, I tend to give advice through conversation."
6519,109,1,30,ESTJ,39,<Yes>  It's because planning is the only way to pass the time by controlling the amount of work you can handle in a day or the amount of personal things you can experience.
6520,109,1,30,ESTJ,40,"<Yes>  It seems to be an innate tendency. If you make a plan and execute it, there's not much to feel anxious about."
6521,109,1,30,ESTJ,41,"<Yes>  It's because I prefer to have a conversation by organizing sentences through text, and when I talk on the phone, I feel that I can't pick up when I make a mistake."
6522,109,1,30,ESTJ,42,"<Yes>  A few days ago, I had a conversation with my acquaintances on the subject of marriage while on a trip, and then we talked for about 4 hours."
6523,109,1,30,ESTJ,43,"<Yes>  tend not to think about who has to make an appointment first, and if I want to meet, I tend to ask if it's time."
6524,109,1,30,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  There is a problem with the company and it has not been resolved yet, but in the meantime, we have continued to make plans that have changed and are trying to deal with it quickly."
6525,109,1,30,ESTJ,45,"<no>  I don't have any regrets at all, but since I can't change the past anyway, I tend to put it away like this."
6526,109,1,30,ESTJ,46,"<Yes>  The reasons for existence and life are different for each, and I don't think it's a matter that needs to be deeply pondered."
6527,109,1,30,ESTJ,47,<no>  Don't be swayed by emotions. He is considered to have a good personality.
6528,109,1,30,ESTJ,48,"<no>  I don't do anything to lose face because I did something wrong, but I don't try to save him."
6541,110,1,30,ENFP,1,"<Yes> Rather than trying to make it on purpose, meeting people in any environment seems comfortable and easy to get along with, and I like meeting various people."
6542,110,1,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  These days, I'm into drawing or making art, but I'm studying digital drawing a lot in particular."
6543,110,1,30,ENFP,3,"<Yes>  When I watch TV programs or movies, I sometimes cry because I empathize well, but sometimes I cry while watching cartoons."
6544,110,1,30,ENFP,4,"<no>  don't think about things that will go wrong in advance and I don't prepare for it, so I don't think about various countermeasures because I'm thinking of working hard on what I've been given."
6545,110,1,30,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  I majored in musical instruments, but there was a moment when I had to stand in front of a lot of people and explain."
6546,110,1,30,ENFP,6,"<Yes>  At a party or event, I tend to introduce myself to new people if I already know them."
6547,110,1,30,ENFP,7,"<no>  I am still doing various projects at the same time, such as music concerts and work activities, but I am very curious and have good performance skills, so I often do many things at once."
6548,110,1,30,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  My mood affects everything in my daily life, but I know it's not good and I'm trying not to."
6549,110,1,30,ENFP,9,"<no>  I'm curious and do a lot of things, so I use a diary to write down things to do, but I don't really like organizing."
6550,110,1,30,ENFP,10,<no>  I don't dwell too much on mistakes because I think that even small mistakes are experiences and a stepping stone for my growth.
6551,110,1,30,ENFP,11,"<Yes>  I tend to approach and talk to people I'm interested in first, and it's not difficult to get close to them, but most of them seem to like me."
6552,110,1,30,ENFP,12,"<Yes>  I am interested in and enjoy sharing art and talking about it in my own words, so I participate in reading forums and movie discussions."
6553,110,1,30,ENFP,13,"<neutrality>  Emotions come first, but I tend to think about distinguishing between public and private affairs rationally, and people around me think positively."
6554,110,1,30,ENFP,14,"<Yes>  like going to the sea or going to the movies spontaneously, but I try not to act like that because of my responsibility."
6555,110,1,30,ENFP,15,"<neutrality>  No matter what other people think, I know that I am a valuable person, so I don't think too deeply about it, but I tend to think a lot about whether my actions reflect wrongly."
6556,110,1,30,ENFP,16,"<Yes>  These days, I was the overall activity leader at the church for summer bible school, and it was so fun and fun when I participated."
6557,110,1,30,ENFP,17,"<Yes>  When I watch a movie or a book, I always enjoy interpreting and expressing it in my own way with my standards."
6558,110,1,30,ENFP,18,"<Yes>  I think I have talent as a leader, so I think helping others to make things go well is rewarding and enjoyable for me."
6559,110,1,30,ENFP,19,"<neutrality>  I have a lot of interest, but I try to practice even small things, so I don't know what to do, and I don't procrastinate."
6560,110,1,30,ENFP,20,"<no>  If I'm worried that things might go wrong, I won't be able to do anything, but I enjoy solving new tasks without fear."
6561,110,1,30,ENFP,21,"<no>  Even if I'm not a leader, I become a leader when I work in one part, and I'm good at that role and I like it."
6562,110,1,30,ENFP,22,"<no>  I have won a prize in a composition music contest, and I am an artist who participates a lot in creating works and plays instruments."
6563,110,1,30,ENFP,23,"<neutrality>  I think the difference between humans and animals is that they have emotions and reason at the same time, and I think it makes the world a better place because they coexist together."
6564,110,1,30,ENFP,24,"<no>  When you want to take a break, you can relax without tidying up the house."
6565,110,1,30,ENFP,25,"<neutrality>  It's nice to watch other people's debates, but I also like to participate."
6566,110,1,30,ENFP,26,<no> You have to get other people's attention so that you can act as a leader and lead them in the direction you want.
6567,110,1,30,ENFP,27,"<neutrality>  In the past, my emotions fluctuated so much that I felt like I was riding a wave, but now the ups and downs aren't that great and it's not to the point of affecting my life."

6572,110,1,30,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  I get tired of theory-based discussions because they are boring and boring, but I try to listen."
6573,110,1,30,ENFP,33,"<neutrality>  I can empathize with people from completely different backgrounds, but I'm careful because I don't want to be hurt by the other person because of the ignorance I've never experienced."

6601,111,0,40,ENFJ,1,"<no>  When I was young, I liked meeting new friends regularly, but now I don't try to make more friends. I feel like I have more things to worry about."

6603,111,0,40,ENFJ,3,"<no>  Just because someone else is crying doesn't make you want to cry. Unless you are in a state of empathy, you don't feel that way."
6604,111,0,40,ENFJ,4,"<neutrality> Rather than making preparations in case things go wrong, we prepare more meticulously to make things go well. I think that's important."

6606,111,0,40,ENFJ,6,<Yes>  I like talking to people I already know rather than introducing myself to someone I'm meeting for the first time. Because it makes conversation easier.
6607,111,0,40,ENFJ,7,<Yes>  You can focus on a new project rather than having to start working on another after you've completed one without a hitch.
6608,111,0,40,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it's emotional, sometimes it's not emotional, so I can't be specific. I think it depends on the situation."
6609,111,0,40,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  I'm a planner, so I like to make lists. I always take notes on my phone."
6610,111,0,40,ENFJ,10,"<no>  I always have a habit of preparing thoroughly before doing anything, so I don't make mistakes, but I don't doubt my abilities just because I make mistakes."

6612,111,0,40,ENFJ,12,<neutrality>  I like to discuss works of art that I know well. I think it's normal because it requires specialization.
6613,111,0,40,ENFJ,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. I tend to tell people around me that I am realistic and rational. That's what I think.

6615,111,0,40,ENFJ,15,"<no>  I don't really think or worry about how it will look. As long as you haven't done anything that makes other people uncomfortable, you don't have to worry about that."
6616,111,0,40,ENFJ,16,"<Yes>  I like doing group activities. I like to be in front of others, so I always like to be involved."
6617,111,0,40,ENFJ,17,<no>  I do not interpret it in my own way. I accept the ending that the director of the book and the movie seeks as it is.
6618,111,0,40,ENFJ,18,<Yes>  I love helping others succeed. You will feel more satisfied and rewarded.
6619,111,0,40,ENFJ,19,"<Yes>  There are so many interests. Sometimes I wonder which one to start with first. Recently, I've been thinking about which lecture to take first."
6620,111,0,40,ENFJ,20,<neutrality>  I'm not the type to worry about things going wrong. I tend to prepare thoroughly before anything goes wrong.

6622,111,0,40,ENFJ,22,"<neutrality>  I don't have a lot of artistic inclinations, but that doesn't mean I don't have one. I love to talk about and deal with art."
6623,111,0,40,ENFJ,23,"<no>  Reason is important, but emotions are also necessary, so I don't think it would have made the world a better place if only rationality was emphasized."
6624,111,0,40,ENFJ,24,<Yes>  It is inconvenient to relax if you do not do household chores. So I tend to do all the housework and rest.
6625,111,0,40,ENFJ,25,<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. I feel uncomfortable when I see you arguing.

6629,111,0,40,ENFJ,29,<neutrality>  Sometimes we don't do things right away and we procrastinate. It seems to have been like that a lot lately when it was hot.
6630,111,0,40,ENFJ,30,<neutrality>  I'm not that interested in the afterlife. Because I think the present reality is more important.
6631,111,0,40,ENFJ,31,"<Yes>  I don't hate being alone, but I value ties with other people, so I like to spend time with other people these days."
6632,111,0,40,ENFJ,32,"<neutrality>  The theory-based story feels boring, but I think it's an important part. I think everything has substance when the theory is the center."
6633,111,0,40,ENFJ,33,<neutrality>  don't think it's easy to empathize with someone from a completely different background. I think life itself is different if the background is different.
6634,111,0,40,ENFJ,34,<no>  I tend not to procrastinate on things that have to be decided. Procrastination makes me feel uncomfortable.
6635,111,0,40,ENFJ,35,<Yes>  Decisions that have already been made are generally not rethought. Because I put a lot of thought into making that decision.
6636,111,0,40,ENFJ,36,"<neutrality> These days, I tend to enjoy spending time alone. I used to enjoy meeting people more."
6637,111,0,40,ENFJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't really enjoy looking at works of art. I think it's possible only when you can afford it, so I rarely do it these days."
6638,111,0,40,ENFJ,38,"<no>  It used to be difficult to understand other people's feelings. But these days, I'm generally trying to understand and accept it."
6639,111,0,40,ENFJ,39,<Yes>  prefer to plan ahead and get things done. I think that's how you can spend the day to the fullest.
6640,111,0,40,ENFJ,40,"<neutrality>  There are quite a few times when I feel insecure. I have a lot of worries about everything, so I always feel anxious, but it's not that big."

6642,111,0,40,ENFJ,42,"<Yes> Opinions that are very different from mine take a lot of time to understand. I tend to spend a lot of time trying to understand as much as possible, rather than simply skipping over trying to understand."
6643,111,0,40,ENFJ,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to contact you to meet you first. I was like that when I was younger, but after becoming an adult, I don't have anything special to contact first."
6644,111,0,40,ENFJ,44,"<Yes> If there's a setback to our plans, we'll go back and fix it as soon as possible. Even when there was a problem with delivery a while ago, I remember moving to take care of it before other things."
6645,111,0,40,ENFJ,45,"<Yes>  Many times we regret mistakes made long ago. Sometimes the memories of that time come to mind, and there are many times when it hurts my heart."
6646,111,0,40,ENFJ,46,"<neutrality>  don't think deeply about human existence, but I don't think about it either. I think that each human being lives with a reason for existence and life, and we should respect and respect that."
6647,111,0,40,ENFJ,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions. It's because it's hard to stay focused when you're swayed by emotions. People around me tend to think that way too.
6648,111,0,40,ENFJ,48,"<Yes>  No matter how certain my mistake is, I can't insult, lower or hate a person's character, so I try to save face."
6661,112,1,40,ENFJ,1,"<no>  I used to enjoy making new friends and meeting new people, but as I get older, I think maintaining relationships with the people next to me is more important, so I don't bother making new friends unless it's absolutely necessary. not."
6662,112,1,40,ENFJ,2,"<neutrality>  am curious, so I have a variety of interests, but there are times when I explore deeply, and there are times when I know lightly. These days, I'm studying Spanish because I'm fascinated by Spain while watching travel YouTube."
6663,112,1,40,ENFJ,3,"<neutrality>  There may be various reasons why other people are crying, but if you cry while talking about a sad or difficult situation, or if you cry because you are so happy, I feel that emotion and cry together."
6664,112,1,40,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to make plans in advance before starting work, but since I have experienced more unexpected variables than when things go according to my plan, now I am making preparations in addition to the initial plan."
6665,112,1,40,ENFJ,5,"<neutrality> I'm nervous in a high-pressure environment, but I usually try to keep my composure, and when I do, I seem to enjoy working through the situation. Recently, there was a situation where I had to work on and submit a set amount according to a deadline, and I was very shaken from the beginning to getting used to it, but I ended up submitting it within the deadline."
6666,112,1,40,ENFJ,6,"<Yes> When you go to a party or event, the goal is usually to meet someone you already know, and you can even talk to someone new after you've talked to them first. If it's absolutely necessary, it's not difficult to introduce yourself to new people first."
6667,112,1,40,ENFJ,7,"<no> If you have multiple projects, you can't fully focus on one project because you're curious about the contents or progress of other projects because you're only holding on to one project. I still have a labeling project in progress as my main project, and I spend most of my day on the main project, but at the same time I don't miss out on other projects."
6668,112,1,40,ENFJ,8,"<Yes>  don't seem to be on the side of trying to hide my joy and sadness because I think it's healthy to express and resolve emotions well. However, in a situation where I am angry, I rather tolerate the situation and get over it, but after that, I keep thinking about the situation I endured, and my heart becomes more difficult."
6669,112,1,40,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  Every year at the beginning of the year, I organize my schedule for the year on a calendar or diary, and use a mobile phone memo app or post-it notes to prepare for travel, holidays, ancestral rites, and grocery shopping by writing down a list of preparations and deleting them one by one."
6670,112,1,40,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  I calmly make a lot of mistakes, so whenever I make a mistake, there are times when I blame myself for why I do it all the time. For example, I often make small mistakes such as spilling food or dropping things while eating, and when I need to convey some information to avoid making a mistake, I check it several times through search before delivering it, and I try to avoid spelling errors. Look for it and write it down."
6671,112,1,40,ENFJ,11,"<Yes>  I don't find it difficult to open up to people I'm interested in. That interest is not interest in the opposite sex, but there are many cases of people who have something in common with me or who are in a common situation, and I talk to them first because I want to share that situation with them. Usually, the person has a similar mindset to me, so the conversation flowed naturally."
6672,112,1,40,ENFJ,12,"<Yes>  I find it difficult to look at and interpret works of art, and I don't seem to be the first to do so. However, if you explain the interpretation of a work of art, I tend to listen to it with interest."
6673,112,1,40,ENFJ,13,"<Yes>  think of myself as an emotional person rather than a rational person, so I tend to try to judge or act rationally. In particular, when I am angry, I tend to suppress my emotions rationally and try to be calm rather than emotionally solving them. The evaluations around me seem to be similar to mine."
6674,112,1,40,ENFJ,14,"<no>  tend to plan my schedule for the day and try to somehow do what I planned for that day. I even decide to take a break at home, but 'I'm going to do nothing today' is my plan for the day. It's a great feeling when you go through the day as planned, but if you don't do what you set out to do, it's a little stressful and you have to do it the next day."
6675,112,1,40,ENFJ,15,"<no>  tend to care about who I appear to others. It's not that there was any reason, it's because I don't like situations where other people misunderstand me differently from what I intended, depending on what I say, what I do, or how I look outward."
6676,112,1,40,ENFJ,16,"<Yes>  tend to feel comfortable when I belong to a group, even if it is small, and I can work more excitingly when there is sympathy, such as empathy and encouragement. Looking at the situation these days, when I first started data labeling, I did it alone, but as my acquaintances around me started to do it together, I shared it with each other whenever a project came up, and when I was assigned to the same project, I consulted, supported, and encouraged each other. We feel mutual improvement."
6677,112,1,40,ENFJ,17,"<no>  like books and movies, but I don't like stories that don't have an ending. If a book is published or a movie is released by dividing the season into a continuous story, I tend to watch it until the end comes out."
6678,112,1,40,ENFJ,18,"<Yes> Of course, I feel good when I succeed alone, but I also feel the same way that I want people around me to succeed as well. So, as much as possible, I try to help those people to be successful. That way, when those people become successful, the joy and pride they feel is bigger and better."
6679,112,1,40,ENFJ,19,"<Yes> There are times when I can't decide what to do when the things I've been interested in come all at once, and I get lost. In particular, recently, I have been doing various types of labeling work at the same time, studying languages every day, watching YouTube content that I am subscribed to, and watching my favorite entertainment shows every day. What did I sometimes do? And there are times when I stop thinking for a while."
6680,112,1,40,ENFJ,20,"<Yes> It's not that there was any trigger, I tend to have a lot of thoughts, but when I go through my thoughts one after another, I often think of the worst case scenario. Sometimes I shed tears imagining the worst case scenario."
6681,112,1,40,ENFJ,21,"<Yes>  After all, a leader needs leadership to lead an organization and there are many decisions to be made, so I think it is difficult to take on the role of a leader because I have a hard time thinking and making decisions."
6682,112,1,40,ENFJ,22,"<Yes>  I usually tend to think and act according to universal rules or standards, so I think I am far from artistic inclination because I lack creativity. I often had a hard time solving problems when I had to think and judge creatively, but at times like that, when someone came up with a creative solution, I thought, Why can't I think of that?"
6683,112,1,40,ENFJ,23,"<no>  Reasonable judgment and resolution can be efficient, but people are animals with emotions, so sometimes when you acknowledge and sympathize with the other person's feelings, you think that there are parts of the problem that are easier to solve than you think."
6684,112,1,40,ENFJ,24,"<Yes> Even if I take a break when I have chores to do, I cannot fully focus on the break. Then, even while taking a break, while looking at the clock, I make a plan in my head to wake up in a few minutes and finish unfinished chores."
6685,112,1,40,ENFJ,25,"<neutrality> It's not fun to watch an argument in a situation where you react emotionally to a heated argument, but any argument that shares different thoughts and opinions in a healthy way is always fun to watch and I'm willing to participate in it."
6686,112,1,40,ENFJ,26,"<Yes>  Because I care about how I look to others and pursue universal things, I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention as much as possible."
6687,112,1,40,ENFJ,27,"<no> It seems to be different depending on the situation in which emotions occur and what kind of emotions you feel, but I think I tend to control my emotions so that I don't overdo it. For example, if you are angry, as soon as you get angry, there are cases where you try to hold back your emotions several times and then go over well, and eventually explode in anger. Even in happy or sad situations, it seems to be a tendency to look at the surrounding situation and first check whether it is okay to be happy or sad, and then reveal your emotions."
6688,112,1,40,ENFJ,28,"<neutrality>  usually start with a small plan to work efficiently, but when I see people who are chaotic and spontaneous, I get embarrassed and sometimes annoyed."
6689,112,1,40,ENFJ,29,"<Yes>  I think I've been like that since I was young, but when I'm nearing a deadline for an exam or work, I tend to focus my concentration as much as possible. Then I made a mistake or didn't finish the job, so lately I've been trying to finish it as early as possible, and I'm enjoying the peace of mind that comes after I finish it."
6690,112,1,40,ENFJ,30,"<Yes>  Religiously, I believe in past and future lives, and I believe that human relationships are also connected through fate and karma. So, I think there must be an afterlife, and I think the content is interesting."
6691,112,1,40,ENFJ,31,"<neutrality> Originally, I like to spend time with others rather than alone, but these days, it seems that there are many times when I like to be alone. Somehow, as the corona situation got longer, it was difficult to meet other people as freely as before, and during the children's vacation, I had a lot of time to spend with my children without any time to myself, so I think my time alone has improved."
6692,112,1,40,ENFJ,32,"<neutrality> Personally, I think that a story without theory and principle is rare, so even if it is boring, if necessary, I think we should have a theory-centered discussion and listen to the principled story."
6693,112,1,40,ENFJ,33,"<Yes>  I tend to listen to the other person's story well, but if it's difficult to relate to someone from a completely different background than mine, I tend to listen more and try to understand the other person's story so that I can relate."
6694,112,1,40,ENFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to think in detail for a long time, so I imagine various situations before making a decision, and I try to find the most suitable decision that satisfies all imaginable situations, so it takes a long time to make a decision. So it seems that I think and think again and again until almost the end when I have to make a decision."
6695,112,1,40,ENFJ,35,"<no>  tend to make a decision after thinking about it for a long time, so I worry about what to do if the decision I made is wrong."
6696,112,1,40,ENFJ,36,"<no>  In the past, it was fun to attend meetings and events on weekends, but these days, there are not many meetings or events due to corona, and once a meeting is held, I worry about clothes or hairstyle until I go, Imagining the situations makes me feel a little tired before going, rather than having fun."
6697,112,1,40,ENFJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't go to art museums on purpose, but I don't find it interesting or hateful to appreciate artworks or artworks. I don't fully understand the work because I lack artistic inclination, but it's fun to discover parts I didn't know after listening to the booklet or explanation."
6698,112,1,40,ENFJ,38,"<neutrality> I'm the type of person who tries to understand other people's feelings, so I don't have many hard times, but sometimes it's hard to understand. For example, when someone is unable to control their emotions and pours out their emotions, it is difficult to immediately understand why the situation is uncomfortable and embarrassing, but as they review the situation, they eventually try to understand why that person did it."
6699,112,1,40,ENFJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan work and personal things. If you don't plan, it's hard to start and you feel uncomfortable."
6700,112,1,40,ENFJ,40,"<neutrality>  I usually try to think positively, so I rarely feel insecure, but when there is a safety-related problem, I tend to think of the worst situation, so I feel extremely anxious at times."
6701,112,1,40,ENFJ,41,"<neutrality> It depends on the case. For inquiries or consultations, it is more convenient to write in writing, but I feel more comfortable talking on the phone when I need to make casual conversations with acquaintances or make public contact."
6702,112,1,40,ENFJ,42,"<neutrality> Basically, since each person has a different opinion, I think it is possible to have an opinion that is different from mine, and if you have a very different opinion, I am more curious about why that person has such a different opinion, so I try to understand it. I do. However, if you have an irreconcilable difference with my opinion, I may not make an effort to understand."
6703,112,1,40,ENFJ,43,"<no>  It's rare that I ask to meet first, and it's usually my friends who ask me to meet first."
6704,112,1,40,ENFJ,44,"<Yes> If there is a setback to the plan, I tend to try to go back to the original plan whenever possible. Recently, my daughter has an important event, so the whole family moves by car, but it took longer than planned. Moving is the fastest way to get there, so I was frustrated when it didn't go as planned."
6705,112,1,40,ENFJ,45,"<Yes>  I am a person who makes many mistakes and thinks a lot, so there are often cases where I regret the mistakes of a long time ago."
6706,112,1,40,ENFJ,46,<no> We believe that all human beings have a value and that their lives have a reason.
6707,112,1,40,ENFJ,47,"<no>  I believe that if I am swayed by my emotions, I will make mistakes or regret it, so I try to control my emotions and make rational decisions."
6708,112,1,40,ENFJ,48,"<Yes> There is no need to save face when a mistake is made with a deliberate and malicious mind, but if the wrongdoing occurs due to the other person's mistake or wrong judgment, the other person is embarrassed and regrets the result, so rather know the mind. Because I want to give and comfort."
6721,113,0,20,ENFJ,1,"<Yes>  The reason is that I tend to talk to interns at facilities for the disabled and new disabled users when they first go to work or during lunchtime. As for the experience, I was nervous when I first came 8 years ago, but I tend to adapt as I approach new friends."
6722,113,0,20,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  The reason is that during lunch (free) time at facilities for the disabled, these days, due to COVID-19, we do not eat zigzag, but rather sit at a table at a facility for the disabled and eat. After eating, I personally do not brush my teeth due to corona. Now sit back and enjoy your phone game free time."
6723,113,0,20,ENFJ,3,<Yes>  cry in my heart. The reason is that teachers at facilities for the disabled are embarrassed when we cry together. I approach you and tell you comforting words.
6724,113,0,20,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  I notify the disability facility teacher when things go wrong or when I find a defective piece of work. The reason is that if you don't call the teacher at the facility for the disabled, you may get into trouble."
6725,113,0,20,ENFJ,5,"<no>  The reason is that if you can't keep your composure, you don't have the strength to carry heavy things."
6726,113,0,20,ENFJ,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk to friends or church teachers I already know at church. The reason is that after the worship service, before going home, I get a snack and communicate with the teacher."
6727,113,0,20,ENFJ,7,"<no>  I have a break after working on bounding or polygons continuously. The reason is, in a word, tired."
6728,113,0,20,ENFJ,8,"<Yes> I'm happy when I have a company calendar or data labeling job. The reason is that the main company and the sub company have been separated, and they have been able to make a lot of money."
6729,113,0,20,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  I make plans using a smartphone memo app. The reason is that when a movie I like comes out at the cinema, I can go see it."
6730,113,0,20,ENFJ,10,"<no>  I know it sounds like a difficult question to understand, but I don't question your ability knowledge. It's hard to know why."
6731,113,0,20,ENFJ,11,<Yes> It's easy for me because I have someone I like to do like independent living. The reason is when you get a house later.
6732,113,0,20,ENFJ,12,<no>  I have no interest whatsoever. The reason can be explained by hoarseness and pain in the throat.
6733,113,0,20,ENFJ,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow friends of the opposite sex who will live independently. The reason is that I have a really happy face smile.
6734,113,0,20,ENFJ,14,"<Yes>  I'm making money. The reason is that the main company and Crowdworks work from home, so it's convenient."

6739,113,0,20,ENFJ,19,"<Yes>  The reason is that there are many things that companies like, such as data labeling, often don't know."
6740,113,0,20,ENFJ,20,<Yes>  I am often worried and if things go wrong... the reason is that I could be scolded by the teacher at 100%.

6846,115,0,40,ENTJ,6,"<neutrality>  At that time, each situation is different, but at familiar parties or events, I usually talk to people I know, and at new parties or events, I spend time actively introducing myself."
6847,115,0,40,ENTJ,7,"<Yes>  I tend not to enjoy so-called multitasking, but the reason is that if I create several tasks and process them simultaneously, I cannot clearly produce the desired result somewhere."

6849,115,0,40,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  recently got into the habit of organizing things to do, so I tend to record my schedule on my phone and do it at the right time."
6850,115,0,40,ENTJ,10,"<no>  A small mistake has no effect on the overall part. It's a small mistake, but it has little effect on the overall picture."
6851,115,0,40,ENTJ,11,"<Yes> In fact, I don't tend to approach and talk to people I'm interested in first, and most of the time, the other person talks to me first, but I respond without hesitation, so it's not difficult to have a conversation."
6852,115,0,40,ENTJ,12,"<Yes>  I don't think discussing various interpretations of artwork itself is an attitude towards art. A work of art is not a language of another country, nor an interpretation, but an individual feeling. Attempting to interpret something in it is an impure attitude."

6857,115,0,40,ENTJ,17,"<neutrality>  don't understand the question I want to ask whether all books and movies can be interpreted in their own way. Interpreting it in someone else's way means that you did it because you thought so, isn't it coercion?"
6858,115,0,40,ENTJ,18,"<no>  I feel satisfied whenever the success of others is of any benefit to me, and there is no reason to prioritize my success without any reason or condition."

6862,115,0,40,ENTJ,22,"<no>  tend to value reason more than emotion, but that doesn't mean I don't have artistic tendencies. This is because they come into contact with many works of art."
6863,115,0,40,ENTJ,23,"<Yes>  Since there is an impulse in all emotions, I think that the world can be a better world only when it values reason."
6864,115,0,40,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  Because they pursue a perfect personality, they finish their chores and take a break before taking a complete break."

6868,115,0,40,ENTJ,28,<Yes>  get annoyed because I'm not doing my best when I'm doing similar or identical tasks and I'm noticeably less efficient than I am.
6869,115,0,40,ENTJ,29,<no>  What needs to be done can be done quickly and at the right time and in the right circumstances to achieve the best results.
6870,115,0,40,ENTJ,30,"<no>  The current world is much more complicated than the afterlife, and there are many things to do."
6871,115,0,40,ENTJ,31,"<no> These days, spending time alone to prepare for the next task is better than spending time with other people."
6872,115,0,40,ENTJ,32,"<neutrality>  I think theory-centered discussions are very important, but we are so obsessed with them that the theoretical discussions are boring."
6873,115,0,40,ENTJ,33,"<Yes>  At the center of rational thinking is caring for the other person and starting from the following, so even if the background is different, you can easily sympathize."
6874,115,0,40,ENTJ,34,<no> Any decision should be made as quickly as possible. The reason is that you are given time to prepare for the next action faster than anyone else.
6875,115,0,40,ENTJ,35,<Yes>  You have to put an end to the decision you have already made so that you can make a bold decision without hesitation in the next decision.

6878,115,0,40,ENTJ,38,"<no>  Understanding other people's feelings is one of the easiest things. People tend to talk about their worries well, and I listen well too."
6879,115,0,40,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  From planning everything to thinking that you are already doing it, it is essential to get the job done the right way."
6880,115,0,40,ENTJ,40,"<Yes> There is no special reason, it seems to be a natural tendency. Many times I don't feel any anxiety at all."
6881,115,0,40,ENTJ,41,"<Yes>  I think making a phone call is a last resort, so avoid making a phone call as much as possible and thoroughly explain in advance to prevent the question itself by calling."
6882,115,0,40,ENTJ,42,"<neutrality>  I try to converge opinions that are very different from mine, but I don't put a lot of time into it."
6883,115,0,40,ENTJ,43,"<Yes> If necessary, most of them contact me first and ask to meet, so I tend to meet with my friends."
6884,115,0,40,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  If something goes wrong with the plan, I try to go back to another version of the plan I had in mind."
6885,115,0,40,ENTJ,45,"<no>  I do not regret things that have already passed, but I think about whether there is something I missed in that situation."
6886,115,0,40,ENTJ,46,<no>  I tend to spend a lot of time thinking about how human existence should have meaning.
6887,115,0,40,ENTJ,47,"<no>  Being swayed by emotions is no different from animals, so it is easier and more familiar to control emotions."
6888,115,0,40,ENTJ,48,<no>  There is nothing to overlook the other person's obvious faults in consideration of face and relationship. Point out each one so that you do not make repeated mistakes.
6901,116,1,30,ENFP,1,<no>  I don't try to make new friends regularly. I always think that I should pay more attention to my old friends.
6902,116,1,30,ENFP,2,"<neutrality>  I use my free time to explore my interests, but my interests are limited and not diverse. These days, I'm interested in companion animal health, so I'm reading related books."
6903,116,1,30,ENFP,3,"<neutrality>  When I see other people crying, sometimes I want to cry too. When I see her crying, it feels like that emotion is conveyed intact."
6904,116,1,30,ENFP,4,"<Yes> No matter what I do, I always have a plan in place. The future is unpredictable, so if you don't prepare in advance, you feel anxious."
6905,116,1,30,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to keep my composure well in any environment. Recently, I had the experience of taking on someone else's work and being pressured, but I persevered and successfully completed the task."
6906,116,1,30,ENFP,6,"<Yes> When I am exposed to a new environment outside of my daily life, I tend to talk to people I already know. Rather than blindly approaching new people, I tend to slowly approach them over time."
6907,116,1,30,ENFP,7,"<Yes>  I tend to finish one project and then start another. When I participated in several projects, I had to finish one project first so that I could work on the next project with peace of mind. Otherwise, I couldn't work because I was constantly worrying about unfinished projects."

6913,116,1,30,ENFP,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. Maybe that¡¯s why people around me tend to ask me when there¡¯s something to be decided rationally. Sometimes I hear that I am cold.
6914,116,1,30,ENFP,14,"<neutrality>  I like to improvise, but sometimes I feel like I need a plan. There are times when I wonder if I would have been more efficient if I had thoroughly planned my work."
6915,116,1,30,ENFP,15,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I worry that I won't look bad to others. There was a time when I had a minor misunderstanding with another person, and if I hadn't resolved that misunderstanding, I think they would have continued to look at me negatively. I'm a little worried that this kind of misunderstanding will happen again."
6916,116,1,30,ENFP,16,"<Yes>  like group activities. I tend to get energy when I spend time with other people. No matter how busy I am, I always spend time with my friends on weekends, exercising and talking."
6917,116,1,30,ENFP,17,"<no>  I like the ending as the producers intended. I recently watched a movie called Matilda, and it was nice that it didn't require any special interpretation and showed good luck and evil."
6918,116,1,30,ENFP,18,"<no> It would be satisfying to help others succeed, but I think my success is more important. I think that if I succeed, there will be more people who can help."
6919,116,1,30,ENFP,19,"<no>  Even if I have a lot of interests, I tend to focus on the things I am most interested in. There are a lot of things I want to do lately, so I've studied them all, but I'm only focusing on the one thing I like the most."
6920,116,1,30,ENFP,20,<no>  tend not to think that things will go wrong. I think it's more efficient to do my best in what I'm doing now rather than worrying in advance.
6921,116,1,30,ENFP,21,"<Yes>  I try to avoid leadership roles in groups as much as possible. I know the responsibility of being a leader is heavy, so I want to avoid it if possible."
6922,116,1,30,ENFP,22,"<neutrality>  I don't think I have any artistic inclinations. I've been learning the piano for a long time and I like classical music, but I'm not good at art."
6923,116,1,30,ENFP,23,"<no>  I don't think the world would be a better place if reason was more important than emotion. Humans are animals of emotions, and I think if emotions were ignored, the world would be very desolate."
6924,116,1,30,ENFP,24,"<Yes>  It's good to finish your chores and take a break. There is still work to be done, but I don't feel comfortable taking a break."
6925,116,1,30,ENFP,25,"<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. I don't like to see people like that because most of the time when we're arguing, our feelings get hurt."
6926,116,1,30,ENFP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. No matter what I do, I try to solve it quietly without anyone else's touch."
6927,116,1,30,ENFP,27,"<Yes>  tend to have extreme emotional changes. Even if I'm in a bad mood because of something bad, when I listen to the music I like, my mood gets better and I smile."
6928,116,1,30,ENFP,28,"<no>  I don't get annoyed at seeing people who aren't effective. Even if the team members I work with are slow, I tend to understand and wait."
6929,116,1,30,ENFP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. I have a project that started a week ago and is due today, but I kept putting it off and started it today."
6930,116,1,30,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  I think the question about the afterlife is interesting. Since I have not experienced death, many predictions, including whether or not there is an afterlife, are interesting."
6931,116,1,30,ENFP,31,"<neutrality>  I think we need both time to be alone and time to spend with others. I work alone on weekdays, but on weekends I always spend time with other people."
6932,116,1,30,ENFP,32,"<no>  I don't think the original story is boring. I usually enjoy talking about theories, and I think that grounds are important in everything."
6933,116,1,30,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  I tend to relate easily to anyone, even from a different background. I think that I am the only one, and that all people are different, so I tend to accept and sympathize with everyone."
6934,116,1,30,ENFP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to think a lot before making a decision. I don't change my decisions, so I try my best and make my decisions carefully."
6935,116,1,30,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  I do not reconsider the decisions I have already made. Once you start thinking about it, there is no end to it, so I tend to think and believe that the decision was right."
6936,116,1,30,ENFP,36,"<Yes>  tend to have fun meetings to relieve the fatigue of the week. At least once a week, I gather with my friends and have a party at my house."
6937,116,1,30,ENFP,37,<Yes>  I like going to art galleries. I search for exhibitions regularly and go to the ones I want to go to.
6938,116,1,30,ENFP,38,<no>  It's easy to understand other people's feelings. You can roughly guess what happened just by looking at your friend's voice or expression.
6939,116,1,30,ENFP,39,"<no>  don't like planning my daily to-dos. Rather than systematically planning, I tend to act freely within the line of setting goals and successfully completing them."
6940,116,1,30,ENFP,40,"<neutrality>  Very occasionally I feel insecure. I try to make my mind as comfortable as possible because I think that if I am frightened and anxious, I will not be able to do anything."
6941,116,1,30,ENFP,41,<Yes>  I want to avoid making phone calls. It's easier to think slowly and write down than to talk over the phone.
6942,116,1,30,ENFP,42,"<no>  I'm not the type to spend a lot of time trying to understand other opinions. Rather than taking time to think, I tend to accept other opinions whenever possible."
6943,116,1,30,ENFP,43,<no>  I'm not the type to contact my friends to meet them first. I usually meet because my friends contact me first.
6944,116,1,30,ENFP,44,"<Yes> If there is a setback in my plans, I try my best to go back as planned. Recently, the deadline suddenly came up earlier, so I canceled all existing appointments and had a hard time meeting the deadline."
6945,116,1,30,ENFP,45,"<Yes>  There are many times when I regret the mistakes of a long time ago. Lately, I'm regretting not being a little more kind to my estranged friend."
6946,116,1,30,ENFP,46,"<Yes>  tend not to think deeply about the reason for human existence. If you think about it, there is no end, so I tend to do my best in the given life and try to live it as enjoyable as possible."
6947,116,1,30,ENFP,47,"<Yes>  I have a hard time controlling my emotions. Especially when I see someone who abuses animals, I have a hard time controlling my anger, so I tend to tell people around me to calm down."
6948,116,1,30,ENFP,48,"<Yes> Even if the other person makes a mistake, I tend to try to save the face of the other person. I don't want the other person to be more embarrassed, and I think everyone can make mistakes."
6961,117,1,30,ENFJ,1,"<Yes>  It's good to stay with old friends for a long time, but the more you stay with each other, the more tired you are, and there's the joy of meeting new people."
6962,117,1,30,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, I'm interested in data leveling and coding. And I'm interested in the barista side that makes coffee again!"
6963,117,1,30,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  I think it might be a similar feeling to wanting to cry when watching a sad movie. I can sympathize with your feelings, so I feel sad even though it's not my job."
6964,117,1,30,ENFJ,4,"<neutrality>  There are times when I think of countermeasures, and there are times when I don't, but I think it's case by case. When it comes to things that are prudent, it seems that the more prudent they are, the more they think about countermeasures."
6965,117,1,30,ENFJ,5,"<neutrality>  It's hard to keep your composure completely. However, I am trying to overcome it somehow. Recently, when I was learning barista work, I learned from someone who put a lot of pressure on me, but I still tried to overcome it with a smile."
6966,117,1,30,ENFJ,6,"<no>  Of course I would have a conversation with someone I know, but when I meet someone new, I tend to start with greetings and exchanges. It's not just a gathering of friends, it's a party and event!"
6967,117,1,30,ENFJ,7,"<neutrality>  It depends on the job, but most tend to try to do that. When many things overlap, the plan goes awry."
6968,117,1,30,ENFJ,8,"<Yes>  It's embarrassing, but I often cry while watching movies, listening to songs, or reading novels. There are times when I get lost in sentimentality and struggle with lingering feelings."
6969,117,1,30,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  really like it! I tend to use an electronic calendar more often than a handwritten diary, so it helps if I write down important things every day."
6970,117,1,30,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  I guess I'll do it. So, for example, if I said I was studying barista, would I be at this level? If I made a guess and made a mistake, it might not have been, but it turned out."
6971,117,1,30,ENFJ,11,"<Yes> You are a person who is interested. If you're hooked on that person, you'll already be planning how to talk to them, but it's easy to put that plan into action. Most did."
6972,117,1,30,ENFJ,12,"<no>  It's good to discuss various interpretations, and I think it's good to meet many people and listen to their opinions."
6973,117,1,30,ENFJ,13,<no>  I tend to follow my emotions. The evaluation of the surroundings is similar. They say that I am a very emotional person and easily get caught up in my emotions. whatever feelings
6974,117,1,30,ENFJ,14,"<no>  I want to plan my itinerary for the day! Even if it's not detailed, what to eat today, what to do today. What did you decide to do today! It's good to think of the same thing."
6975,117,1,30,ENFJ,15,"<neutrality>  I used to be a bit like that, but these days I don't worry too much. Even if others hate me, it's enough for me to like them!"
6976,117,1,30,ENFJ,16,<Yes>  like meeting a lot of people and hearing a lot of stories. It's good to have different opinions.
6977,117,1,30,ENFJ,17,<neutrality>  It's difficult to choose between a closed ending and an open ending... There are movies I like with open endings. I like Interstellar.
6978,117,1,30,ENFJ,18,"<Yes>  My own success is also a great joy, but when I help others succeed, hearing 'It's thanks to you' makes me feel good enough."
6979,117,1,30,ENFJ,19,"<neutrality>  These days, there are a lot of things that can be used as hobbies, so there are a lot of things that interest me! However, we do plan step by step. Do a jewel cross-stitch first, then a quilt... something like that."
6980,117,1,30,ENFJ,20,"<Yes>  Maybe it comes from the fear of the plan going awry. It would be nice if the world went back as planned, but there are many variables."
6981,117,1,30,ENFJ,21,"<neutrality>  Rather than stepping forward, I want to play a supporting role. However, if everyone says they can't do it, then I can leave."
6982,117,1,30,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I don't think there are any at all. However, it is not enough compared to those who make this field their business. It feels like that."
6983,117,1,30,ENFJ,23,"<neutrality> To be honest, I think it would have become a more heartless world. I don't like a world where a sick old woman falls down on the street and says, 'I might be late, so let's get past it.'"
6984,117,1,30,ENFJ,24,"<Yes>  After finishing all the housework, taking a shower, I want to relax and go to sleep. If you don't clean up, it's like there's something that hasn't been resolved."
6985,117,1,30,ENFJ,25,"<no>  I think debate is absolutely necessary, but I don't want to see a lot of debate. I like peaceful conversation."
6986,117,1,30,ENFJ,26,"<Yes>  If you draw attention and move forward, you won't be able to see the faces of the people behind you. It's difficult for someone with a personality who wants to take care of every single person."
6987,117,1,30,ENFJ,27,"<Yes>  My emotional ups and downs are so severe... I came out crying after watching a sad movie, but when I see a funny message from a friend, I end up laughing."
6988,117,1,30,ENFJ,28,"<no>  It can be frustrating, but not annoying. For example, if there is a person in front of me who has difficulty using the kiosk, I want to help quickly. No matter how long it takes, it will take less than waiting."
6989,117,1,30,ENFJ,29,"<no>  If you procrastinate and procrastinate, there are fewer and fewer things you can solve. So let's break it down quickly. It has been like that until now and it hasn't changed recently."
6990,117,1,30,ENFJ,30,<neutrality>  I do not know. Maybe you feel it's not interesting. I have never thought so deeply about the world after death. I'm hoping it's a good place.
6991,117,1,30,ENFJ,31,"<Yes>  I want to have a conversation with other people, even on trivial topics. These days, it hasn't changed, so I tend to talk a lot with my friends through KakaoTalk. I also call."
6992,117,1,30,ENFJ,32,"<Yes>  I don't think theories and principles are unnecessary or bad, but I think we should talk about experiences and cases more than just dealing with them. This is what I always thought when I had theory-based discussions in college."
6993,117,1,30,ENFJ,33,"<Yes> very much Even if you come from a completely different background, you are still a person. The important thing is not the background, but the emotions of the people themselves. Most of my friends who come to me for counseling do not have the same background as me, but I didn't have any trouble empathizing with them."
6994,117,1,30,ENFJ,34,"<no>  If you put off making a decision, you will have more worries. Making a decision without thinking is a problem, but the decision to postpone and procrastinate is definitely a problem. I tend to decide as soon as possible after thinking carefully."
6995,117,1,30,ENFJ,35,"<Yes>  Unless something big enough to overturn the decision already made, looking back will only leave regrets and regrets. I don't think there is a 100% good decision in the world."
6996,117,1,30,ENFJ,36,"<Yes>  I need a break by myself for the fatigue accumulated over the week, but I also like events. Even if it's consumption. I want to gather and talk with people."
6997,117,1,30,ENFJ,37,"<Yes> Rather than going alone, it's better to go with someone and talk about your impressions after watching it all."
6998,117,1,30,ENFJ,38,"<no>  Not at all. If it's a complicated emotion, there are times when I can't understand all of it, but the clearest emotion on the outside is definitely conveyed. For example, if it's 'I'm sad because I broke up with my boyfriend and I hate him', even if you don't know the hate right away, you can understand the sadness."
6999,117,1,30,ENFJ,39,"<Yes>  like you. And you have to write it down like this so you can do it without forgetting it. If you organize it in your head, you might forget it unless it's an AI."
7000,117,1,30,ENFJ,40,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I don't. There are times when I am anxious that my plans will go awry, but I also feel relieved because there are people who are with me. It seems to be an innate tendency."
7001,117,1,30,ENFJ,41,"<no>  I don't know why making phone calls is difficult. If you don't have enough time or are busy, you can."
7002,117,1,30,ENFJ,42,"<neutrality>  It's not that I don't want to understand, but rather than spending a lot of time, I just admit it and move on. 'That person has that kind of opinion. This is my opinion,' he concluded. There were many such things."
7003,117,1,30,ENFJ,43,"<neutrality>  There are only friends like me around me. Sometimes I contact you first, and sometimes my friends contact me first."
7004,117,1,30,ENFJ,44,"<neutrality>  There are times when I want to go back, and when I think it would be better to make a new path than going back, I go on a new path. Recently, while working on a project, there was something that went in a completely different direction from the plan, but I thought it would consume too many things to go back, so I proceeded in a random way, and it turned out pretty well. Nothing ever went according to plan."
7005,117,1,30,ENFJ,45,"<Yes>  Usually, I think I regret when I hurt someone's feelings. I shouldn't have hurt you so much back then. There could have been a better response. Like that."
7006,117,1,30,ENFJ,46,"<Yes>  The deeper you dig into the reason for your existence and life, the more frantic you become to find evidence to support your reason. In fact, even without such evidence, we exist and life goes on."
7007,117,1,30,ENFJ,47,"<neutrality>  When I was young, I was very emotionally swayed. And as I grow up, I try a lot to make it a little more bearable. Even so, people around me still say that I am swung around."
7008,117,1,30,ENFJ,48,"<Yes>  It's because there's nothing coming back to me even if I step on my face and cut down on my mistakes. So, rather than because I like the other person, this is basically a board of consideration. I want to be taken care of like that too."
7021,118,0,20,INTP,1,"<neutrality>  It's fun to make new friends, so people don't mind coming, but they value the time spent in existing relationships, so they don't go out to meet."
7022,118,0,20,INTP,2,"<Yes>  If I can earn money, I want to help society, so I am taking lectures aloud. The purpose is to donate readings to the braille library in the future."
7023,118,0,20,INTP,3,"<Yes> When we see a person crying, we are moved by imagining their situation. So I'm trying to think of words and comforts that can help."
7024,118,0,20,INTP,4,"<no>  It is important to prepare for when things go wrong, but I have learned throughout my life that if you do your best to make things go well, you will forgive yourself for the mistakes that follow."
7025,118,0,20,INTP,5,"<Yes> The less excited you are, the better the solution will be to get better results, so I usually manage my mind with yoga to maintain my composure."
7026,118,0,20,INTP,6,"<Yes>  When you talk with acquaintances, people naturally approach you. It's because the conversation with the people who approached first was more empirical."
7027,118,0,20,INTP,7,"<no>  When there are multiple tasks given, I look at the whole as if baking a draft, and when I work, I sometimes get another insight while working on one, so I do that."
7028,118,0,20,INTP,8,"<Yes>  When I come into contact with the media, I tend to feel the deep meaning that others have not felt or feel the warmth of others."
7029,118,0,20,INTP,9,"<no>  I don't tend to look back on what I write down after work, so I consider it a waste of time unless it's a long-term memory."
7030,118,0,20,INTP,10,<no>  It's not like that because I've experienced social recognition compared to the past.
7031,118,0,20,INTP,11,"<no>  Reaching out to new people has always been difficult. However, if I feel that he is the right person for me, I muster up the courage to approach him first and talk to him."
7032,118,0,20,INTP,12,"<no>  I am interested in talking about works of art. For artists, art is a means of communication. Therefore, I think talking to people about what they are saying enriches social communication."
7033,118,0,20,INTP,13,"<no>  I think honest words about feelings produce better results if concrete alternatives are followed. Even if you think about your surroundings, a conversation that contains emotions is more convenient for communication."
7034,118,0,20,INTP,14,<Yes>  I enjoy the joy I get when things go well rather than the disappointment I get when things go wrong.
7035,118,0,20,INTP,15,"<Yes>  think I have the basic skills to not look bad in society when I judge myself. Therefore, we do not set other people's standards when censoring ourselves."
7036,118,0,20,INTP,16,"<no>  These days, as an introvert, I feel the importance of taking time to focus more on myself."
7037,118,0,20,INTP,17,<Yes>  I liked the polished and condensed ending of 'My Liberation Journal'. Leaving room for interpretation in one's own way is considered more sophisticated and not pretentious than not.
7038,118,0,20,INTP,18,<no>  I am trying to become a person who can give and share my success with others without ending my success with personal success.
7039,118,0,20,INTP,19,"<no>  It's not when I'm working for a company, but when I'm doing personal things, I tend to be immersed in one thing. Enjoy the pleasure of immersion."
7040,118,0,20,INTP,20,"<no>  can't help but worry about it, but I'm trying to reduce it as much as possible. Rather than wasting time worrying, we do our best to pay for things and quickly find a way to fix things."
7041,118,0,20,INTP,21,"<no>  It's because doing what you can do on your own comes with a risk, but with a greater sense of accomplishment."
7042,118,0,20,INTP,22,"<no>  I also make music as a hobby, and I think that sensitivity and artistic inclination are sometimes necessary even when doing office work."
7043,118,0,20,INTP,23,<no>  I think that reason lacking emotion leads to the wrong omnipotence and gives rise to hatred and discrimination. Efforts to understand emotions must be accompanied to create a good society.
7044,118,0,20,INTP,24,"<Yes>  We know that a break after doing what needs to be done is sweeter than a rest without. If you can't finish what you had in mind, it's hard to fall asleep as it leaves an afterimage."
7045,118,0,20,INTP,25,"<Yes>  If it is a meaningful conversation, you will learn that it is more efficient to say this in such a situation."
7046,118,0,20,INTP,26,<no>  Receiving attention from others is a natural human pleasure to form one's ego through relationships. I find myself working harder when appropriate praise and rewards follow.
7047,118,0,20,INTP,27,<no>  Maintaining a calm attitude prevents unnecessary situations and leads to a stable life.
7048,118,0,20,INTP,28,<no>  I'm trying to calmly tell you a more efficient way. I enjoy teaching.
7049,118,0,20,INTP,29,"<Yes>  It was not intentionally delayed, but better results were obtained when a lot of information and concerns were followed. Even now, when it doesn't work out, I'm working with the same attitude."
7050,118,0,20,INTP,30,"<neutrality>  The question about the afterlife is interesting, but has languished a little since it has already been concluded."
7051,118,0,20,INTP,31,"<no>  As an introverted person, I feel the importance of focusing more on my inner self and developing my inner self more recently while watching introverted people."
7052,118,0,20,INTP,32,<no>  I think that the individual and the spirit are missing in all practices without principle. No one likes a politician who only chases votes without thinking.
7053,118,0,20,INTP,33,"<no> With different backgrounds, it is impossible to empathize. Even if it is not sympathy, I think it is society that strives to approach with understanding and tolerance."
7054,118,0,20,INTP,34,<neutrality>  We know the difference between things that can afford to produce better results through reflection and things that need to be done quickly.
7055,118,0,20,INTP,35,<Yes>  It is more important to think about how to better solve the next step when a decision has been made.
7056,118,0,20,INTP,36,"<no>  I think relatively unproductive conversations take place for smooth communication in places where more than 5 people are conversing. Therefore, I tend to relieve fatigue by meeting a few people I like, reading books alone, or watching my favorite video media."
7057,118,0,20,INTP,37,"<Yes>  I like the sound and atmosphere of art museums, and I also like to appreciate art works because it gives me new inspiration."
7058,118,0,20,INTP,38,"<Yes>  As I work, I feel a lot that each person has a different way of thinking, just as there is a word 'thinking style'. Understanding emotions is understanding the way of thinking itself, and I don't think it can be done absolutely. Therefore, I try to approach my feelings with understanding and tolerance as much as possible."
7059,118,0,20,INTP,39,"<no> Rather than planning things, I improvise first and then fix them in a better way or even turn them over completely."
7060,118,0,20,INTP,40,"<Yes>  Efforts were made to minimize anxious thoughts that were negative to me, and as a result, I became a tendency not to keep anxiety itself in mind on a daily basis."
7061,118,0,20,INTP,41,"<Yes>  Compared to face-to-face conversations or elaborate writing, there are many risks associated with phone calls. Because the emotional part is not expressed."
7062,118,0,20,INTP,42,"<Yes>  Even if it's inefficient, if you don't understand this problem now, you risk running into the same problem again in another situation, so I think it's beneficial in the long run. The effort to actually understand it made it easier to understand in the same way in the next situation."
7063,118,0,20,INTP,43,"<no>  He doesn't take good care of his surroundings. Instead, focus on the time you meet and try to convey your heart."
7064,118,0,20,INTP,44,"<no>  My colleagues forgot their appointments and the schedule was disrupted, but considering the situation so far, I asked for their understanding and adjusted the schedule in my favor."
7065,118,0,20,INTP,45,"<no>  Regret, like worry, I tried not to do it, so at some point I stopped doing it. It is better to solve something that cannot be undone by regretting it than to regret it."
7066,118,0,20,INTP,46,<no>  I spend a lot of time thinking and reading books because I believe that every decision comes from the thoughts I have about existence and the reason for living.
7067,118,0,20,INTP,47,<no>  Controlling your emotions is more efficient in many ways than being manipulated. People around me acknowledge the efficiency of my emotions that I actively reveal when necessary because they know me who is normally calm.
7068,118,0,20,INTP,48,"<no>  If it is not a part related to evaluation, it is important for the efficiency of the person and everyone to point it out at the time when the situation occurred."
7081,119,1,30,INFP,1,"<no>  You don't make new friends on a regular basis. The reason is because I prefer to share my feelings while meeting a friend, so I think making new friends periodically is tiring."
7082,119,1,30,INFP,2,"<Yes>  I am exploring food, ingredients, cafes, etc. because I like to make food, search for delicious food, cafes with a good atmosphere, or explore and use newly released products or ingredients."
7083,119,1,30,INFP,3,"<no> It's not like that. There are times when I feel embarrassed when I see someone else crying, and there are times when I want to cry when I hear or see a sad situation or story rather than seeing someone else cry."
7084,119,1,30,INFP,4,"<no>  Quite the opposite. Rather, there are times when it is difficult to handle the back work because you work without setting up a contingency plan."
7085,119,1,30,INFP,5,"<neutrality>  I can't answer precisely because I don't think of a high-pressure environment. But overall, I think it's half and half when I look at the ability to cope with situations."
7086,119,1,30,INFP,6,<Yes>  Talk to someone you already know. It is to relieve tension and have comfort because there is a lot of tension.
7087,119,1,30,INFP,7,"<no>  I tend to do both at the same time. Since I have a hard time focusing on one thing, doing several things at the same time seems to be the way I don't get bored easily."
7088,119,1,30,INFP,8,"<Yes> It's deeply sentimental. When we see stories of poor people or sad news, we are easily assimilated and shed tears."
7089,119,1,30,INFP,9,"<no>  Not at all. I want to make a plan and keep it well, but I'm lazy and can't put it into action."
7090,119,1,30,INFP,10,"<neutrality>  Rather, I tend to think that it can. However, when I do the same thing as others, if I make a mistake alone, I blame myself or doubt my ability. It seems to be suspicious when there is a comparison target."
7091,119,1,30,INFP,11,"<Yes>  I want to get to know someone I'm interested in, so I greet them first or approach them with a smile and have a conversation."
7092,119,1,30,INFP,12,<no>  Rather the opposite. I'd like to discuss it further to know what other thoughts there are for different interpretations.
7093,119,1,30,INFP,13,<no> There are many things that I regret following my feelings. Even things that would have gone well if we waited for a while and judged the situation before taking action often go unresolved after our emotions preceded us.
7094,119,1,30,INFP,14,"<Yes>  Most of the time, it happens spontaneously and without planning. It is the tendency to set a big boundary and leave without planning a trip."
7095,119,1,30,INFP,15,"<no>  Rather, I am concerned. There is a strong tendency to want to be seen as a good person who is bright and positive rather than dark."
7096,119,1,30,INFP,16,"<no>  Because I like working alone or being comfortable without being noticed, I don't prefer groups because there is a lot of tension."
7097,119,1,30,INFP,17,"<no>  I prefer movies or books with clear endings. If there is no clear ending, it is frustrating because there are various interpretations."
7098,119,1,30,INFP,18,"<no>  Success is more important to me. However, I do not think that the standard of success is high because it is self-satisfaction."
7099,119,1,30,INFP,19,<no>  I'm worried because I have no interests. I think you need to have an interest that you can be deeply interested in.
7100,119,1,30,INFP,20,"<Yes>  Influenced by my mother, I tend to think negatively, so I tend to worry about buying it."
7101,119,1,30,INFP,21,"<Yes>  I feel pressured to take responsibility, so I think it's better to act as a staff member or a second person rather than a leader."
7102,119,1,30,INFP,22,"<no>  I think you have a great artistic inclination. This is because I write, draw, or listen to my favorite songs until I get tired of them, and the people around me evaluate my creations well."
7103,119,1,30,INFP,23,"<no>  If people's sentiments and emotions were more taken into consideration when enforcing the law, criminals' sentences would have been heavier."
7104,119,1,30,INFP,24,"<Yes> It is not uncomfortable to rest in a clean state after finishing all the housework. If you have to do housework after a break, you cannot take a full rest because of anxiety."
7105,119,1,30,INFP,25,<Yes>  It's interesting to know other people's thoughts and see the difference in their thoughts.
7106,119,1,30,INFP,26,"<Yes>  It's burdensome to receive attention from others, and I feel quite tired because I'm nervous without knowing it."
7107,119,1,30,INFP,27,"<Yes> Emotional ups and downs are very severe. Even if you are depressed, you can easily become positive with the comfort of others, but if the results are not good or the expected results do not come out, you will quickly fall into depression."
7108,119,1,30,INFP,28,"<Yes>  Because I'm not efficient, there are times when I feel frustrated and annoyed when I see someone similar to me."
7109,119,1,30,INFP,29,"<Yes>  If it's something I have to do but don't want to do, I tend to put it off until I can. I keep putting it off with the mindset that somehow it will work out."
7110,119,1,30,INFP,30,"<Yes>  Stories about the afterlife are interesting, and stories about mystery and shamanism are also interesting."
7111,119,1,30,INFP,31,"<Yes>  I was a person who liked and enjoyed spending time alone, but as the corona became longer and the isolation life became longer, I felt lonely."
7112,119,1,30,INFP,32,"<Yes>  This is because they put theory first, think that principled stories are easy to tell, and think that they are not necessary unless they are supported by experience."
7113,119,1,30,INFP,33,"<Yes>  Since people can learn different things from their own experiences and backgrounds, they try to empathize and understand, thinking that it must be a habit or personality learned from that person's own background."
7114,119,1,30,INFP,34,"<no>  I think about it, but I think it's good to make a decision quickly because I don't like long thoughts, headaches, and complicated things."
7115,119,1,30,INFP,35,<no>  have a lot of regrets. I tend to regret and reflect on the decisions I have already made. I regret whatever decision I made.
7116,119,1,30,INFP,36,"<no>  One or two fun parties and events are enough, and after that, alone time is essential. He rarely meets people and is satisfied with a one-time event."
7117,119,1,30,INFP,37,"<Yes>  I don't know much about it, but I like to visit art galleries, exhibitions, museums, etc."
7118,119,1,30,INFP,38,"<no>  I tend to empathize and understand. You can do that, you can do that is a habit."
7119,119,1,30,INFP,39,"<no>  When I plan and fail to achieve, I feel lethargic and disappointed, so I try to cope with the situation and work accordingly."
7120,119,1,30,INFP,40,"<no>  Quite the opposite. He often feels insecure, and although he seems to have a natural tendency to feel depressed, he seems to have been influenced a lot by his mother's negative mindset."
7121,119,1,30,INFP,41,"<neutrality>  I want to avoid phone calls for work and want to leave a history via e-mail, but I want to talk to my acquaintances."
7122,119,1,30,INFP,42,"<no>  They struggle to understand, but don't spend much time. I'm just going with the mindset that I can come up with an opinion like that."
7123,119,1,30,INFP,43,"<no>  I don't bother contacting you to meet first. It's because going out is annoying, so you might make an appointment to meet first and then feel like you don't want to go out."
7124,119,1,30,INFP,44,"<no> If there is a setback in the plan, the first thing I want to do is give up. Rather than trying to deal with it, I put my hands on it, and after a lot of time has passed, I try to recover my energy."
7125,119,1,30,INFP,45,<Yes>  I have many regrets. What if most of them had made a different choice at that time? I have a lot of regrets about why I made such a mistake then.
7126,119,1,30,INFP,46,"<no>  why do humans exist Humans think about why they live, why they were born, and why they exist. They don't give specific answers, but they ask a lot of questions."
7127,119,1,30,INFP,47,"<Yes>  There have been many times when I have been swayed by emotions and overwhelmed by those emotions, and have said or done things that I shouldn't have done."
7128,119,1,30,INFP,48,"<Yes>  Rather than saving face, I try not to embarrass myself. Especially if you are close friends."
7141,120,1,20,ESTP,1,"<neutrality>  don't necessarily try to make new friends. The reason is that there are no good conditions to meet new friends. However, I hate boring things and always pursue new things, so if there is an opportunity to meet new people, I do not hesitate to take the opportunity."
7142,120,1,20,ESTP,2,"<Yes>  have a variety of interests and spend a lot of time exploring them. My interests are, first of all, finance, exercise, blogging, beauty, reading, and growing plants. Jae-tech is studying about a platform to create additional income. Crowdworks is one of them. I like sports because I enjoy physical activities. I promote myself to people through my blog."
7143,120,1,20,ESTP,3,"<neutrality> Depending on what reason the person is crying, there are times when I want to cry along and times when I don't. There are times when I can relate to, when I have had a similar experience, or when I am immersed in the person in a difficult situation, and I also shed tears along with it. At times like these, we shed tears and comfort each other. When this isn't the case, I'm embarrassed because I don't know how to comfort them, and that situation is difficult."
7144,120,1,20,ESTP,4,"<neutrality> Depending on what kind of event it is, I sometimes make preparations and sometimes I don't. For things that will have a big impact on my life, such as my career path and employment, I make preparations in case something goes wrong. It's because you have to make a hole to survive even if one thing perishes. However, for most trifles, travel plans and the like, they don't make preparations. The reason is that it's annoying. If things really go wrong, it's never too late to think and decide."
7145,120,1,20,ESTP,5,<no>  It is difficult to maintain composure in a high-pressure environment. I haven't felt any pressure lately. I don't have the most recent memories...
7146,120,1,20,ESTP,6,"<neutrality>  When I meet people, I probably greet and talk to people I know first, but gradually shift my attention to new people. Meeting new people and learning new things is exciting."
7147,120,1,20,ESTP,7,"<no>  I have a short attention span, lose interest easily, and get bored, so I tend to start, start, and finish a project before it's completely finished. When I work at a company, I work on one thing, but I work on another task as it comes to my mind, and I work on several things at the same time, solving the things that come to mind in order, and the things that interest me in order. (Assuming the priorities and deadlines are the same)"
7148,120,1,20,ESTP,8,<Yes>  This is because I am easily moved when someone gives me a present or does something that thinks of me.
7149,120,1,20,ESTP,9,<no>  I don't like making plans. I like to spontaneously do things that come to my mind and things that attract me. I don't even use diary electronic tools. It's annoying to log. It's good to act and feel it with your body in the time to record.
7150,120,1,20,ESTP,10,"<no>  I don't doubt my abilities. I consider myself to be a special person. However, I do not think or look down on other people. Other people think they are wonderful people in their own way. When I report my work to my boss during work, I praise myself in my heart for thoroughly preparing and reporting."
7151,120,1,20,ESTP,11,"<Yes>  If there's someone I'm interested in and I want to get to know him/her better, I'm free to talk. I ask what the person's interests are, ask questions from the person's answer again, and try to get closer to the person by playing pranks."
7152,120,1,20,ESTP,12,<no>  am very interested in works of art. Because I'm curious about different people's thoughts and it's interesting to think about different possibilities.
7153,120,1,20,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  I follow reason rather than emotion. There are times when you are shaken by emotions. But at the crucial moment, I always follow logic, reason over emotion. People around me usually feel a lot of determination in my words and actions and talk about whether I have no emotions or whether I am a robot."
7154,120,1,20,ESTP,14,<Yes>  I like to improvise. That doesn't mean that there are no plans at all. There are times when you plan for that date several days in advance. But I don't mind ruining my plans if something interesting happens that day that appeals to me.
7155,120,1,20,ESTP,15,"<Yes> My life is mine, so I don't worry about what others think of me. I'm curious, but whatever they think of me doesn't affect my actions. I only know."
7156,120,1,20,ESTP,16,"<Yes>  I attend a wine gathering that meets regularly once a month. The rest of the weekend, I enjoy spending time with friends."
7157,120,1,20,ESTP,17,"<no>  like the closed ending. Rather than multiple interpretations, one clear ending seems to leave no room, so it's neat and nice. The books I read with interest these days are books related to economics."
7158,120,1,20,ESTP,18,<no>  I am satisfied with the work I do to help my success. I prioritize my own success over helping others succeed because I am my highest priority.
7159,120,1,20,ESTP,19,"<Yes>  have a lot of interests, so I sometimes worry about what to do. On weekends when there are no appointments, I am wondering whether I should blog first, read a book, or take care of plants first. There are too many interests."
7160,120,1,20,ESTP,20,"<no>  I don't worry often. Because it will happen somehow. My basic mindset is ""it will work somehow""."
7161,120,1,20,ESTP,21,"<neutrality>  want to be a leader in things that interest me. That's because I can direct and lead in the direction I want. However, I don't want to be a leader in activities or organizations that I'm not interested in. The reason is that I do not know when I will leave the organization, and if I become the leader of the organization, my free time and free will may be infringed by the responsibility as a leader."
7162,120,1,20,ESTP,22,<neutrality>  don't think I have any inclination towards the art I do myself. But I think you have an eye for appreciating the art that has been created. Absolute pitch makes it easy to find the harmony of sound when listening to music.
7163,120,1,20,ESTP,23,"<neutrality>  I believe that emotions and reason should be in proper harmony. Whether it is emotion or reason, there is nothing better between the two. This is because situations that require emotions and situations that require rationality coexist with anyone."
7164,120,1,20,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I want to finish my chores before taking a break. Otherwise, you won't be able to rest comfortably even when you're resting, and you'll be constantly distracted by housework that needs to be done someday."
7165,120,1,20,ESTP,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy arguing. I enjoy the debates I'm in, but I also enjoy watching other people's debates. Because it's interesting to see how many people's ideas collide."
7166,120,1,20,ESTP,26,"<no>  I don't care too much about other people's attention. It's because I do what I want to do, and I don't do what I don't want to do, regardless of other people's eyes or attention. (as long as it doesn't harm others)"
7167,120,1,20,ESTP,27,"<Yes> My emotions change very quickly. I feel like I'm about to cry because I'm suddenly depressed, but suddenly I feel excited when a package arrives, or I suddenly feel better when I hear a KakaoTalk message from a friend."
7168,120,1,20,ESTP,28,<no>  I don't really care who's efficient or not. It's just that I get annoyed when that person's inefficiency takes a toll on me.
7169,120,1,20,ESTP,29,"<Yes> We put things off until the end. I am taking classes online, and many of them have had the experience of hastily filling out and submitting assignments almost on time."
7170,120,1,20,ESTP,30,<no>  I'm not curious about the afterlife. I want to focus more on the present and talk about it.
7171,120,1,20,ESTP,31,"<Yes>  like to spend time with other people. Being alone is empty and boring. When I talk with others, my brain is full of energy and I have the energy to do the things I need to do."
7172,120,1,20,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  am not interested in theory-oriented, principled stories. What I am interested in is what I can see, touch, and feel with my own eyes. For example, my interests are personal colors, sports, playing musical instruments, and finance. Things that actually help me, things I can touch and see with my own eyes, and things that can affect my life."
7173,120,1,20,ESTP,33,"<no>  I can only relate to what I have experienced and what I know. If it's completely different from what I've experienced, I'm not sure how to react."
7174,120,1,20,ESTP,34,<Yes>  I don't make decisions easily. It's because I'm very fickle and I don't know when and how my mind will change.
7175,120,1,20,ESTP,35,"<no>  Even for a decision I made once, I didn't bother to reverse it, but I thought, 'What if I made a different decision?' I do think. In fact, there were times when I regretted the decisions I made. There are times when I dwell on past decisions."
7176,120,1,20,ESTP,36,"<Yes>  Even after a hard day at work, I am energized by the thought of attending an upcoming event. We hold on for a week in anticipation of the event."
7177,120,1,20,ESTP,37,"<neutrality>  am not very interested in going to art galleries or seeing other works of art with my own eyes. It's boring. Rather than that, I like to be able to move my body and do things myself. But I like listening to classical music. It's because I like to listen to the harmony of various instruments and find each sound when various sounds come together."
7178,120,1,20,ESTP,38,"<Yes> It is difficult to empathize and understand the feelings of others. When someone is angry, it's hard to understand why they're angry, and they're not sure how to respond. That's why it's often awkward when giving an emotional reaction."
7179,120,1,20,ESTP,39,"<neutrality>  don't like planning in my daily life. Even if you make plans for the weekend, you only have a general idea of what you are going to do, and you can change it whenever you feel like it when the time comes. When I'm at work, I tend to improvise when there's not much work to do, but when I'm busy and have a lot of work, I make a to-do list and deal with them in order of urgency."
7180,120,1,20,ESTP,40,"<Yes>  don't feel very anxious. It's because there is always a fallback plan when things don't go well, and when the situation hits, it somehow works out on its own. It's not a natural inclination, but because of my adventurous inclination since childhood, I put myself into a crisis, and I think it's because I learned that I can survive even in a crisis through the experience of overcoming that difficult environment."
7181,120,1,20,ESTP,41,"<no>  prefer talking on the phone to typing. The reason is that my fingers hurt when I type letters, and it takes a long time and is frustrating. This is because when talking verbally over the phone, you can hear the other person's immediate response and do not have to write long texts."
7182,120,1,20,ESTP,42,<no>  You don't need time to understand opinions that differ from mine. I think it's okay for people to have different opinions. Because everyone's environment is different.
7183,120,1,20,ESTP,43,<Yes>  I often contact my friends to meet up first. It's because meeting and talking with friends is fun and that in itself gives me strength.
7184,120,1,20,ESTP,44,"<no>  have no intention of going back to the plan I came from. If the plan goes wrong, I enjoy it with the mindset of 'I rather like it'. Recently, I was not able to go to the restaurant I had planned due to communication problems with the taxi driver and was directed to another restaurant. I enjoyed it with the thought, 'This must be a more steamed restaurant because it was guided by a local taxi driver.'"
7185,120,1,20,ESTP,45,<Yes>  I often dwell on mistakes made long ago. I often think about what would have happened if I had made a different decision under some circumstances in the past. Maybe it's because I'm not satisfied with my life right now.
7186,120,1,20,ESTP,46,<Yes>  Most of the time I don't think much about human existence and life. Thinking about those things makes me more unhappy than happy. So I decided to focus on my current life.
7187,120,1,20,ESTP,47,"<neutrality>  seem to be swayed by my emotions a lot. There are a lot of things in my head, and various emotions come and go in my heart. Those feelings don't seem to have a decisive influence on my behavior. The mind is shaken a lot, but in the end, the action is based on rational judgment. In my opinion, I feel like I'm being swayed by my emotions, but the evaluations around me often say that I don't seem to have any emotions."
7188,120,1,20,ESTP,48,"<neutrality>  don't try very hard to save the other person's face. However, it seems that he does not openly disrespect in front of many people. I understand that no one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. However, if intentionality is seen in the other person's fault, or if the fault is repeated, it seems that he will speak loudly even where there are people."
7201,121,0,30,INTJ,1,"<no>  I like people who don't intentionally make friends, but who meet naturally and get close to each other. It's because you can't feel the lack of human relationships normally."
7202,121,0,30,INTJ,2,"<no> If I had a lot of free time, I would be interested in various fields, but I am not able to do that because I do not have enough time."
7203,121,0,30,INTJ,3,<no>  There is usually very little time to cry in situations like that. I feel like I should solve the problem.
7204,121,0,30,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  The more important things are, the more likely it is to make one or two preparations. This is to prevent things from going wrong."
7205,121,0,30,INTJ,5,"<Yes>  When I have a lot of things to do, I regain my composure and try to do it step by step and efficiently."
7206,121,0,30,INTJ,6,"<Yes>  I don't feel comfortable talking to strangers, so I prefer to talk to people I know."
7207,121,0,30,INTJ,7,"<no>  It is intended for time-efficient processing by coming and going as needed. While labeling data, priority is given to items that are urgent and those that have a lot of rewards."
7208,121,0,30,INTJ,8,<no>  usually think realistically and don't have too many sentimental thoughts. It's because I've rarely had the experience of falling into sentimentality naturally.
7209,121,0,30,INTJ,9,<Yes>  I always organize things into a list. It is processed by writing it down on paper at the desk and erasing it one by one.
7210,121,0,30,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  Teaching students, I sometimes think about that when I get stuck."
7211,121,0,30,INTJ,11,"<no> If you don't start a conversation after deciding what topic to talk about, it's a bit difficult to lead a long conversation naturally."
7212,121,0,30,INTJ,12,"<Yes>  I think the opinion of the person who created the work is the most important, but I don't think the subjective opinions of those who don't have much meaning."
7213,121,0,30,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  People around me also say that, and I usually make rational decisions and focus on handling work."
7214,121,0,30,INTJ,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to plan and proceed with my normal routine, but I tend to improvise rather than plan during travel."
7215,121,0,30,INTJ,15,"<Yes>  The older I get, the less I pay attention. I feel that way when I find myself naturally not conscious of others."
7216,121,0,30,INTJ,16,"<no>  don't enjoy working as a group in any activity. It's not that my inclination doesn't change well, but I still enjoy activities that I do alone or in small groups."
7217,121,0,30,INTJ,17,"<no>  When I watch a book or movie, the ending doesn't come out properly, which leaves a lot of room for thought, but the biggest reason I watch movies is because I want to finish watching without thinking, but I don't like it because it doesn't satisfy that."
7218,121,0,30,INTJ,18,"<no> Depending on the situation, I usually feel more satisfied with my achievements."
7219,121,0,30,INTJ,19,"<no>  Even if I have a lot of interests, I tend to prioritize and decide, so I think I'll go through it step by step. I don't have time for that lately, so I don't have to."
7220,121,0,30,INTJ,20,"<no>  I usually prepare well, so I try not to worry as much as possible."
7221,121,0,30,INTJ,21,<Yes>  I don't like the leadership role because I don't like group activities.
7222,121,0,30,INTJ,22,"<no>  I play the guitar, but I don't think so because I have a lot of experience that has been recognized around me."
7223,121,0,30,INTJ,23,"<no>  We believe that a harmonious world can be created only when each person's talents and thoughts are different. If it was a world that only valued reason, it would have been very frustrating."
7224,121,0,30,INTJ,24,"<Yes>  like to do things after organizing my surroundings, so I think that's the case with the question. This is because it is inconvenient to rest comfortably when there is work to do in the eyes."
7225,121,0,30,INTJ,25,"<Yes>  It's nice to be able to observe the thoughts of those people, so I can get a chance to think too."
7226,121,0,30,INTJ,26,"<neutrality>  Normally, they feel comfortable staying unnoticed, but when they encounter a problem or need a solution, they tend to step up and solve it."
7227,121,0,30,INTJ,27,"<Yes>  Emotions change quickly when things that you don't like are repeatedly exposed to people around you, apart from work, during a busy schedule."
7228,121,0,30,INTJ,28,<Yes>  I'm annoyed that I act without thinking of a quick solution.
7229,121,0,30,INTJ,29,"<no>  Usually, we work by priority, and if not, we may be pushed back, but usually we try to solve it in a short time."

7232,121,0,30,INTJ,32,<Yes>  don't think it suits my aptitude to spend time with theoretical stories because I like to evaluate practical utility. You can tell from the fact that I chose engineering instead of pure science.
7233,121,0,30,INTJ,33,"<neutrality>  Empathy can be difficult, but I think it will be interesting to hear the story."
7234,121,0,30,INTJ,34,"<neutrality>  Depending on the kind of work you have to do, the variance is huge. I tend to make decisions quickly when it comes to solo work, and a little late when it comes to joint work."
7235,121,0,30,INTJ,35,"<Yes> Since the situation can't be undone, I tend to think about what to do next."

7240,121,0,30,INTJ,40,"<no>  I feel a lot of anxiety, but I'm consciously trying to put it to sleep. Because it doesn't help in life."
7241,121,0,30,INTJ,41,<Yes>  This is because it is difficult to leave evidence for sure and it is difficult to refine words quickly.
7242,121,0,30,INTJ,42,"<neutrality>  I try to admit even very different opinions, unless they are completely wrong."
7243,121,0,30,INTJ,43,"<no>  Usually, rather than contacting me first, I tend to contact them first and meet them."

7248,121,0,30,INTJ,48,"<neutrality>  It depends a lot on who your opponent is. The more interested people are, the more they try to tell you what's wrong."
7261,122,1,40,ISFP,1,<no>  I don't talk to people I don't know because I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.
7262,122,1,40,ISFP,2,"<neutrality>  I've been playing games for over 5 years and sometimes I make what I need. For example, make a loofah."
7263,122,1,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  I cry because I am sad, I cry because I am happy, and I have a lot of tears, so when someone cries, tears just come out of my eyes."
7264,122,1,40,ISFP,4,"<neutrality>  I don't know what's going to go wrong, so I think little by little, but I don't make a specific plan."
7265,122,1,40,ISFP,5,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on the situation. I recently had a biopsy, and I'm worried, but I think there will be good results."
7266,122,1,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I don't know what to say to a new person, and I can't approach them first because I'm afraid I'll make a mistake again."
7267,122,1,40,ISFP,7,"<Yes>  I had to register the contract with the association while writing the estimate, but I first made the estimate and worked on the contract. If it's too complicated, I'm out of my mind."
7268,122,1,40,ISFP,8,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on how I feel at the time. When I'm in a good mood, the autumn leaves look pretty too."
7269,122,1,40,ISFP,9,"<no>  First of all, I don¡¯t like writing things down by hand, and I tend to avoid complicated things."

7273,122,1,40,ISFP,13,"<no>  Though I should be calm in my thoughts, I scold the children with my actions. Once in a while, the kids said my eyebrows went up."

7275,122,1,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  If I care about people's eyes, that's stressful, so I'm the type to just do it in my own style."
7276,122,1,40,ISFP,16,"<no>  I don't like it because when I go to places with a lot of people, I feel distracted and blank for some reason. These days, I live in a company house repeatedly."
7277,122,1,40,ISFP,17,"<no>  I like history books, so I tend to think of them as they are. It's been a year since I last read a book."

7280,122,1,40,ISFP,20,"<Yes>  I made a mistake while working, and I had to raise my commission this month, but I raised it the next month and lost money."
7281,122,1,40,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  First of all, places with a lot of people are distracted and my head hurts. I'm embarrassed to pay attention."
7282,122,1,40,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  I'm not good at drawing or making things. I made clay with the kids, but they say I'm a poop hand."
7283,122,1,40,ISFP,23,"<Yes>  There will be no guerrilla warfare, and I don't think there will be a war like the war in Ukraine."
7284,122,1,40,ISFP,24,"<Yes>  I have a lot of time to rest when I finish all the housework, so I tend to rest after finishing everything. I get a little annoyed when something happens in the middle of a break."
7285,122,1,40,ISFP,25,<no>  It's a bit cramped when you're fighting. I think we should make some concessions to each other.
7286,122,1,40,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  In a situation where you raise your hand and ask a question in the midst of a lot of people, you just skip it even though you have a question."

7301,122,1,40,ISFP,41,"<neutrality>  I don't avoid talking on the phone, but I don't think I'm calling because I have nothing to say."
7302,122,1,40,ISFP,42,"<no>  If you disagree with me, I think you just follow the other opinion. If you think deeply, your head hurts and you have to pay attention."

7359,123,0,20,INTJ,39,"<neutrality>  I like to plan out my daily to-dos, but I also like to splurge on days. The reason is because there is another fun if you do a sudden job while doing the scheduled work."

7418,124,1,20,ENTP,38,<Yes>  I can't understand the attitude towards the appointment time. I can't understand if you treat me strictly and get angry when you promise to meet at a certain time and don't keep the time.

7486,125,1,30,ESFJ,46,<Yes>  Human beings are so diverse that I don't give meaning to what I think about the existence of human beings themselves and the reasons for each life. I wonder if there is a need for that. I am too busy living.

7488,125,1,30,ESFJ,48,"<neutrality>  First of all, it will depend on the depth of the wrong committed by the other person, but if you are close to me, you tend to save your words in front of others, so I don't think it means saving face."

7502,126,1,40,ESFP,2,"<Yes>  I have many fields of interest. These days, I want to try something new, not what I used to do, so I'm looking for a barista license with interest."

7506,126,1,40,ESFP,6,"<no>  I tend to approach new people first. It's good to get to know new people, and there are many cases where the other person can't approach first, so I tend to approach first and try to get closer."
7507,126,1,40,ESFP,7,"<Yes>  tend to focus on one thing. When you are given multiple tasks at once, your mind gets busy and your ability to do the actual work decreases. It is better to build a sequence and solve it one by one."
7508,126,1,40,ESFP,8,"<Yes>  I am sentimental. Even in one objective situation, why did this happen? I tend to think about various situations and try to understand them."
7509,126,1,40,ESFP,9,<no>  don't like making plans. I get angry when things don't go according to my plan. So I try to act according to the situation at that time.

7511,126,1,40,ESFP,11,"<Yes> I'm not difficult. It's good if I have a crush on you first and approach you and maintain a good relationship, but not everyone has the same mind as me, so if the other person doesn't want a relationship, I don't get hurt."
7512,126,1,40,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in works of art. Because each person has a different opinion, I don't want to discuss things that differ from mine."
7513,126,1,40,ESFP,13,"<Yes>  In the past, emotions took precedence, but now, considering the economic situation, I think more realistically, so I prioritize rational judgment."
7514,126,1,40,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  I like to improvise. The reason is that when things don't go according to plan, I feel frustrated and annoyed, and when things go spontaneously, I look forward to and get excited about the future."

7516,126,1,40,ESFP,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy group life these days. In the past, I liked group activities with many people, but in my late 30s, I don't want to waste unnecessary energy in a crowd of people."
7517,126,1,40,ESFP,17,"<no>  like tight endings. I care about open endings when I'm curious about the writer's intentions and when my thoughts differ from other people's. Recently, I enjoyed watching Mr. Sunshine starring Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-ri."

7519,126,1,40,ESFP,19,"<Yes>  I have a lot of interests these days. I don't know what career path to pursue after leaving my current job. So, I'm researching a lot about various things, but I haven't decided yet which one should be prioritized sequentially."
7520,126,1,40,ESFP,20,"<Yes>  tend to worry a lot. It was hard to cope when things I thought didn't go as planned. So if I have something planned, I'm very worried that it might go wrong."
7521,126,1,40,ESFP,21,<Yes>  I want to avoid the leadership role. I get frustrated and annoyed when people don't act as I planned and demanded.
7522,126,1,40,ESFP,22,"<Yes>  don't think I have artistic inclinations. Ever since I was in school, I had no aptitude for art, music, or sports activities, and I had no desire to do well. And creating something is difficult."
7523,126,1,40,ESFP,23,"<neutrality>  I think it may or may not be. If reason was more important than emotion, it would have been an efficient world, but I think there would be many people whose hearts are difficult to endure in that world."
7524,126,1,40,ESFP,24,"<no>  I prioritize rest first. If I do housework first, there will be things I have to do again and again, and I may not have time to rest later, so I tend to prioritize rest first."
7525,126,1,40,ESFP,25,"<neutrality>  don't enjoy other people's arguments. When I see people who have different opinions than I do, I feel tired because I have to pay unnecessary attention, but sometimes it is helpful to know other people's various thoughts."
7526,126,1,40,ESFP,26,"<Yes>  I hate getting attention. I don't want to be in a situation where I cause harm to someone because of me, and I don't want to attract other people's attention because I'm worried that I won't live up to that person's expectations when I receive attention."
7527,126,1,40,ESFP,27,"<Yes>  I have severe emotional ups and downs. For example, even if you feel very angry after a fight with your husband, if you think about it, your anger will subside quickly and you will quickly turn your attention to other things."
7528,126,1,40,ESFP,28,"<Yes> If a colleague who is in charge of the same job, but is much less than me, the work progresses because of that one person, and other people suffer damage, so I feel frustrated and annoyed."
7529,126,1,40,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  I tend to procrastinate. Recently, I have to organize my luggage before moving, but I keep putting it off because I am tired and think that it is not urgent right now."
7530,126,1,40,ESFP,30,"<Yes> The afterlife is interesting to me. Personally, I think it exists, but it's interesting that there are many different stories about the afterlife, but no one can prove it."
7531,126,1,40,ESFP,31,"<no>  I like my alone time these days. When I was young, I thought spending time alone was boring and wasteful, so I liked spending time with others, but now I like spending time alone because I can do a lot of different things on my own, so I don't have to worry about other people."
7532,126,1,40,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  Original stories feel boring because they think the answer is fixed, so they are not interesting. I have my own thoughts and ways, but it feels frustrating and boring because they don't seem to be accepted."
7533,126,1,40,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  am very empathetic towards others. I grew up in a normal family, but I think that people who do not have no choice but to have different thoughts from me depending on the environment in which they grew up, and I understand their thoughts and the way they have lived."
7534,126,1,40,ESFP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone the decision as much as possible. Before making a decision, I keep thinking about various things and worrying about it, so I think of the best possible way to deal with things if things go wrong, so I tend to make decisions late."
7535,126,1,40,ESFP,35,"<Yes>  I tend not to reconsider my decisions. I think the answer won't change just because I thought about it in a lot of different ways before making a decision, and thinking again after making a decision."
7536,126,1,40,ESFP,36,"<neutrality> It depends on the condition of the body. These days, my stamina is very weak, so I want to hang out with my acquaintances, but I am too tired, so I often take a break by myself. If I am in good physical condition, I want to spend a good time with my acquaintances."
7537,126,1,40,ESFP,37,"<no>  I don't like art galleries. Even when I look at a museum or a work of art, I am not sure of the intention or feeling of the artist. I like things that are clearly given. I am tired of thinking and feeling myself."
7538,126,1,40,ESFP,38,"<no>  I tend to try to understand other people's feelings. Recognizing that all people are inevitably different from me, I tend to understand and empathize with that person¡¯s situation."

7540,126,1,40,ESFP,40,"<Yes>  I don't feel very anxious. I live as much as I can on my own, and if something doesn't go well because I'm lacking in it, I think it's not my fault, it can't be helped."
7541,126,1,40,ESFP,41,"<no>  like to talk on the phone. In the case of a text message or KakaoTalk conversation, there are things that can cause misunderstandings between me and the other person, so I prefer phone calls because I can feel the conversation."
7542,126,1,40,ESFP,42,"<neutrality>  If you have a very different opinion from mine, it can be hard to understand, so even if I don't completely understand the person's opinion, I try to accept it as it is."
7543,126,1,40,ESFP,43,"<Yes>  I prefer to contact you first. If I want to see a friend, I tend to contact them first and make an appointment."
7544,126,1,40,ESFP,44,"<no>  I'm trying to go with the flow. If you try to go back to the original plan in a state where there is a setback in the plan, more nerves and effort are needed, so I try to find the next alternative by changing to another plan depending on the situation at the time."
7545,126,1,40,ESFP,45,"<neutrality>  regret my mistakes, but I try not to take them to heart. Even if I keep regretting it, I can't undo the past, so rather than just blaming myself for my mistakes, I'm trying not to make the same mistakes."
7546,126,1,40,ESFP,46,"<Yes>  I've never really thought deeply about existence and why I live. I'm just living as I'm given, and in that state, I think I'm living in a given environment as much as I try, so I've never thought about life and existence."
7547,126,1,40,ESFP,47,"<no>  In the past, it was difficult to control my emotions, but now I am trying to control my emotions as much as possible and make rational decisions."
7548,126,1,40,ESFP,48,"<no>  I don't bother pointing out the other person's faults and I don't try to save face. I think I have to take responsibility for what the other person did wrong, and I don't want to try to save face in that situation."
7561,127,1,20,ENFJ,1,"<Yes>  I tend to make new friends to gain more energy, learn what I lack, and grow further."
7562,127,1,20,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, I have a lot of interest in stocks and real estate, so I'm learning and learning through YouTube or the community."
7563,127,1,20,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  Because we easily assimilate and relate to other people's emotions, there are times when we feel sad and want to cry together."
7564,127,1,20,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  Things don't always go as planned, so I tend to plan in advance because I feel anxious if I don't make preparations."
7565,127,1,20,ENFJ,5,"<neutrality>  I try to keep my composure in a high-pressure environment, but depending on the situation, I can't do that, so I try to keep my composure as much as possible."
7566,127,1,20,ENFJ,6,"<neutrality>  like to introduce myself to new people first, but when the situation calls for it, I introduce myself first and then talk."
7567,127,1,20,ENFJ,7,"<Yes>  I tend to finish one project and start another, because I'm not perfect when I'm working on multiple projects at once."
7568,127,1,20,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I think it's not good to be easily influenced by the feeling of the moment, so I'm trying to make a rational decision."
7569,127,1,20,ENFJ,9,<Yes>  I tend to plan ahead because the tablet gives me an idea of what I'm going to do and allows me to act flexibly within the framework.
7570,127,1,20,ENFJ,10,"<Yes> Recently, while writing a resume, I thought I checked it thoroughly, but I sent it in a state where the file could not be opened, so I sent it again as a re-attachment. It's not a big deal, but there was a time when I felt like an idiot for sending it without checking it one more time."
7571,127,1,20,ENFJ,11,"<neutrality>  I do approach and talk to people I'm interested in, but I tend to start when they show a little crush first. The other person didn't want to talk, but it's because if you start a conversation first, you may feel uncomfortable with each other."
7572,127,1,20,ENFJ,12,"<Yes>  I like watching and enjoying art works, but I'm not very interested in discussing because it's difficult to find an exact answer because so many different opinions come out during discussions."
7573,127,1,20,ENFJ,13,"<Yes>  If you get too caught up in your emotions, it's difficult to make an accurate judgment on the situation, so you make a rational decision as much as possible. People around me always ask for my opinion when making accurate judgments."
7574,127,1,20,ENFJ,14,<no>  I tend to plan and practice as much as possible in advance because planning and setting up a schedule helps me manage my time better and I can do what I want.
7575,127,1,20,ENFJ,15,"<no>  Since I'm not the only one living in the world, I tend to worry and put in a lot of effort so that others can see me as a decent person."
7576,127,1,20,ENFJ,16,"<Yes> These days, I play badminton, but the exercise itself is difficult to do alone, so after finishing it, I tend to drink beer and enjoy friendship."
7577,127,1,20,ENFJ,17,"<no>  I like books and movies with clear endings and pleasant content, so I can enjoy them lightly without thinking too much, and these days, I like Top Gun."
7578,127,1,20,ENFJ,18,"<no>  First of all, I think that I can feel satisfaction when I help others after I do well, so I think my success comes first."
7579,127,1,20,ENFJ,19,"<Yes>  These days, there are so many things that I am interested in, such as investment and diet, and there is a lot of information, so I have a lot of things to filter and see, so I worry a lot about what to do first."
7580,127,1,20,ENFJ,20,"<no>  If I do well, things won't go wrong, and worrying first won't change the situation, so I try not to worry."
7581,127,1,20,ENFJ,21,<no>  think it's good to take on a leadership role because you have to experience the leadership role so that you can act flexibly based on the experience you've had when doing a certain job later.
7582,127,1,20,ENFJ,22,"<neutrality>  Artistically, I tend to be interested in the fields I like, but I don't have any professional experience."
7583,127,1,20,ENFJ,23,"<no>  If everyone judges and acts rationally, the world is too harsh and difficult, so I think that emotional people can coexist and live."
7584,127,1,20,ENFJ,24,"<Yes>  You should rest in a clean house. Breathing fresh air purifies it, so I tend to finish my housework first and then take a break."
7585,127,1,20,ENFJ,25,"<no>  The end of the argument only hurts each other's feelings, so I think it's good to act by establishing opinions as much as possible."
7586,127,1,20,ENFJ,26,"<neutrality>  Depending on the situation, there are times when I need to receive attention and stand alone, so I tend to draw attention."
7587,127,1,20,ENFJ,27,"<neutrality>  My emotions don't change very quickly, but I tend to change and act according to the mood."
7588,127,1,20,ENFJ,28,"<neutrality>  Each person is different, and just because that person is not efficient doesn't mean they can't work. Each person has a different way, but if there's a good way, I tend to let them know."
7589,127,1,20,ENFJ,29,"<no>  It's something I have to do anyway, but if I put it off until the end, the perfection of the work will also decrease, so I tend to take care of it in advance."
7590,127,1,20,ENFJ,30,<Yes>  Questions and answers about the afterlife seem very interesting and mysterious because people always wonder where they go when they die.
7591,127,1,20,ENFJ,31,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation, but since I spend a lot of time alone these days, I tend to spend time with other people and gain energy."
7592,127,1,20,ENFJ,32,"<no> Since the story that is fundamental to the theory is the original theory, I don't think it's boring because it's easier to understand if you know it first and have a theory-centered discussion."
7593,127,1,20,ENFJ,33,"<neutrality>  Since each person may have a different background and different thoughts, it may be difficult to easily sympathize with each other's thoughts, but I try to empathize."
7594,127,1,20,ENFJ,34,"<Yes>  It's not good to make a decision quickly, so I tend to listen to various opinions and make a decision at the end."
7595,127,1,20,ENFJ,35,"<no>  Decisions already made are not always accurate, so I tend to ask for other people's opinions one more time and combine as many opinions as possible with my own to make a decision."
7596,127,1,20,ENFJ,36,"<neutrality>  It's best to mix time alone with parties and events so that the balance is right, so we tend to enjoy each other appropriately."
7597,127,1,20,ENFJ,37,"<neutrality> Sometimes I like to go to the exhibition hall to see and enjoy it when I want to gain knowledge, but it is difficult to go often due to the location and conditions."
7598,127,1,20,ENFJ,38,"<no>  Looking into a person's eyes and seeing their actions show their emotions, so I tend to quickly grasp and understand them."
7599,127,1,20,ENFJ,39,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it's faster and better to plan and act, and sometimes it's better to improvise, so I tend to act according to the situation."
7600,127,1,20,ENFJ,40,"<neutrality>  There are times when I feel uncomfortable, but if I show it all, I become a sensitive person and make the other person uncomfortable, so I tend to express it according to the situation."
7601,127,1,20,ENFJ,41,<no>  I prefer to do it over the phone because I have to talk on the phone so I can hear the voice and know how the other person feels.
7602,127,1,20,ENFJ,42,"<no> Since each individual has a different opinion, other opinions, including mine, may also have good opinions, so I tend to understand and accept them quickly."
7603,127,1,20,ENFJ,43,"<neutrality>  When I miss you, I contact my friends first, and my friends contact me when they are curious about me and want to see me, so I tend to contact each other and communicate often."
7604,127,1,20,ENFJ,44,"<neutrality> On a recent trip, I had the experience of visiting another store because the store I wanted to go to was closed. First of all, because you don't know how the situation will turn out, even if you try to go back to the plan you made, you will fail from the beginning, so you act according to the situation."
7605,127,1,20,ENFJ,45,"<no>  It's not a situation that will change again even if you regret it, so based on that time, I'm trying not to make a second mistake now."
7606,127,1,20,ENFJ,46,"<neutrality>  tend to think about why humans are born and why each person lives differently, but thinking deeply doesn't change anything, so I tend to live faithfully to reality."
7607,127,1,20,ENFJ,47,"<neutrality>  There are times when you have to make rational decisions, so you try to be as emotional as possible, but there are times when you act emotionally."
7608,127,1,20,ENFJ,48,"<neutrality>  Even when the other person's fault is obvious, the act of cutting the other person is toxic to me, so I tend to act according to the situation as much as possible."
7621,128,1,30,ENTP,1,<Yes>  I love making friends in new places. The reason is that it is fun to listen to and sympathize with various people's stories.
7622,128,1,30,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  I spend most of my free time reading books or chatting with people around me, and I am interested in various fields. These days, I am interested in AI technology, so I watch a lot of videos on the Internet."
7623,128,1,30,ENTP,3,"<Yes>  Sometimes when I see someone else crying, I want to cry too. Especially when a friend cries while talking about their worries, I also cry."
7624,128,1,30,ENTP,4,"<no>  Even if we make various preparations, there are always many new things that happen, so we try to respond flexibly to the situation."
7625,128,1,30,ENTP,5,"<neutrality>  Depending on the situation, sometimes you stay calm and sometimes you don't. My friend's father passed away recently, and I was in trouble because I had to work overtime on the day I was going to visit the funeral home. I was nervous because things were not going well."
7626,128,1,30,ENTP,6,"<no>  At events, I usually introduce myself to new people first to get acquainted with them. Because meeting new people is always fun."
7627,128,1,30,ENTP,7,<no>  I usually work on multiple projects at the same time because it takes a lot of time to fully complete one project. I try to keep a detailed record of my progress.
7628,128,1,30,ENTP,8,"<no>  Even if you read a sad movie or a touching book, you seem to have a strong tendency to think rationally."
7629,128,1,30,ENTP,9,"<no> Making a schedule or list is too tiring for me. Usually, in a diary, you write things that happened in the past tense."
7630,128,1,30,ENTP,10,"<neutrality>  I doubt myself for small mistakes, but I try not to doubt it because it doesn't help me."
7631,128,1,30,ENTP,11,<Yes>  I tend to start a conversation centered on daily life with someone I'm interested in and try to find a consensus.
7632,128,1,30,ENTP,12,<Yes>  usually don't discuss it because I'm not very interested in art.
7633,128,1,30,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. Because emotions make judgments in an instant, but reason makes decisions based on past data, so reliability is high. I'm not sure about the reviews around it."
7634,128,1,30,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  I don't like to plan my day, so I usually like watching a movie or meeting friends on the fly."
7635,128,1,30,ENTP,15,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different depending on the situation. I'm the type of person who doesn't care about other people's gazes, but in some situations, gazes do bother me."
7636,128,1,30,ENTP,16,"<Yes>  I tend to enjoy group activities with people, such as going mountain climbing or riding a bicycle with people at work."
7637,128,1,30,ENTP,17,"<Yes>  used to prefer closed endings, but these days I also like open endings where I can create an ending with my imagination. The drama ""My Name is Kim Sam-soon"" had an open ending, which was good."
7638,128,1,30,ENTP,18,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. I don't want to help the success of people I don't like, but I find satisfaction in helping the people I want to succeed succeed."
7639,128,1,30,ENTP,19,"<Yes> My future aspirations were diverse, such as being a pilot, an astronaut, and a film director. There are still many things I want to do. These days, I like to travel and I also like to write."
7640,128,1,30,ENTP,20,"<no>  I realized that even if I worried about things going wrong, the results were always different. So don't worry."
7641,128,1,30,ENTP,21,"<no>  The group needs a leadership role, and if that's me, I think I can step out. It's about working with people and helping them."
7642,128,1,30,ENTP,22,"<neutrality>  I think I have a bit of an artistic inclination, but it's hard to say because it's not enough to say I have skills."
7643,128,1,30,ENTP,23,<Yes>  I think mistakes are usually made with a lot of mixed feelings. So I think the world would have been better if reason was more important.
7644,128,1,30,ENTP,24,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the mood of the day. There are times when you want to do housework after a break.
7645,128,1,30,ENTP,25,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on what the subject is. I think it would be fun to look at the controversy when it comes to science topics that I love.
7646,128,1,30,ENTP,26,"<no>  I tend to approach people first, or show off if I know something to get their attention."
7647,128,1,30,ENTP,27,"<no>  Because I usually try to act rationally, my emotions don't change quickly. After suppressing emotions, think and act."
7648,128,1,30,ENTP,28,<neutrality>  I guess it depends on my condition and environment. But I try not to be irritable.
7649,128,1,30,ENTP,29,<Yes>  I have often tried to rush things later by putting things off until the end. That's how most things work.
7650,128,1,30,ENTP,30,<Yes>  think people gather somewhere after they die. I believe it is true not only for humans but also for animals. This is because research on the afterlife continues.
7651,128,1,30,ENTP,31,"<no>  Because I am so bored with my alone time, I try to be with people around me, such as talking or eating."
7652,128,1,30,ENTP,32,"<neutrality>  I think the degree of boredom is different depending on the topic of the original story. I am interested in theory-based discussions, but the principled story differs from time to time."
7653,128,1,30,ENTP,33,"<neutrality>  I don't easily empathize with people whose backgrounds are completely different from mine, but I try to empathize."
7654,128,1,30,ENTP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to make decisions quickly and spend less time thinking about them. It's because I'm the type of person who thinks that no matter how much I worry about it, it's meaningless."
7655,128,1,30,ENTP,35,<Yes>  I tend to forget about decisions I have already made. Because replaying is bad for your mental health.
7656,128,1,30,ENTP,36,<Yes>  I tend to relieve my fatigue with fun parties and events. The energy I get from hanging out with people is my driving force.
7657,128,1,30,ENTP,37,<neutrality>  I like to go to art galleries from time to time because I especially like to see works of art by my favorite artists.
7658,128,1,30,ENTP,38,"<neutrality> Sometimes it's hard for me to understand other people's feelings, but I try to empathize as much as I can. It is when a friend brings up a sad story."
7659,128,1,30,ENTP,39,"<no>  I hate planning things. When it comes to work, I tend to plan, but I hate personal things."
7660,128,1,30,ENTP,40,<Yes>  I don't think my innate tendency itself makes me feel insecure. I don't feel anxious except when I'm in a hurry to go to the bathroom.
7661,128,1,30,ENTP,41,<Yes>  I think face-to-face conversation rather than phone calls is more convenient and efficient in conveying information.
7662,128,1,30,ENTP,42,"<neutrality>  Depending on the situation, I tend to try to understand opinions that are different from mine. Sometimes I don't try to understand other opinions if they don't align with my values."
7663,128,1,30,ENTP,43,<Yes>  usually contact my friends to meet first. Because you don't have friends who tend to contact you first.
7664,128,1,30,ENTP,44,"<Yes>  When something unexpected happens, I try to remember what happened in the past and deal with it similarly, and I try to be as flexible as possible."
7665,128,1,30,ENTP,45,"<no>  I tend not to think about the mistakes I made a long time ago, and even if I feel regret, I try to forget it right away."
7666,128,1,30,ENTP,46,<Yes> Human existence and the reason for living is such a difficult subject for me. So I don't think too deeply about it.
7667,128,1,30,ENTP,47,"<no>  Rather than being swayed by emotions, I tend to control my emotions and live a rational life. The evaluation of the surroundings is also similar."
7668,128,1,30,ENTP,48,"<no>  If the other person's fault is obvious, actions to save the other person's face may look foolish, so refrain from doing so."
7681,129,1,40,ISFJ,1,<no>  don't think you need a new friend. I think we can become friends in a relationship that leads naturally.
7682,129,1,40,ISFJ,2,<Yes>  I am watching with interest in the knowledge needed to raise children's sex education and sons.
7683,129,1,40,ISFJ,3,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation or who the person is. In situations where I can fully sympathize, I want to cry with them, but in situations where I don't, I tend to try to understand the other person."
7684,129,1,40,ISFJ,4,<Yes>  I have several numbers in mind in case things go wrong or my plans change. This is to avoid embarrassment when unexpected situations arise.
7685,129,1,40,ISFJ,5,"<neutrality>  I tend to try to keep my composure in a high-pressure environment. At first, I felt afraid and anxious because of the pressure, but as time passed, I regained my mind and tried to do it to the end."
7686,129,1,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  Since the party or event is already an unfamiliar environment, you can get a sense of the atmosphere by talking to a familiar person you already know."
7687,129,1,40,ISFJ,7,"<no>  I am curious about other things, and because I tend to get bored easily after doing one thing, I tend to take on multiple projects."
7688,129,1,40,ISFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I'm not very sentimental, but sometimes I get moved by the little things or get emotional."
7689,129,1,40,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  I don't write detailed items in detail, but I tend to write down schedules and things I have to do in my diary."
7690,129,1,40,ISFJ,10,"<Yes>  There was a work that I had a lot of companions during my recent work, and at that time I thought that I was still lacking a lot."
7691,129,1,40,ISFJ,11,"<no> Rather than approaching the person I'm interested in first, I tend to wait for that person to approach me first. Even if I am interested, the other person may not want it."
7692,129,1,40,ISFJ,12,"<neutrality>  I think it is natural for various interpretations because each person has their own perspective and thoughts. If you have a different opinion than mine, I usually accept it and end it."
7693,129,1,40,ISFJ,13,"<neutrality> You try to follow your reason rather than your emotions, but sometimes you see that you follow your emotions. It seems to depend on the situation. People around me tend to follow reason rather than emotion."
7694,129,1,40,ISFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I plan a schedule for the day, but I tend to do things that I want to do when things don't go awry."
7695,129,1,40,ISFJ,15,"<Yes>  I wonder if other people think so too. I don't have any reason, but I want to be seen as a good person to the other person."
7696,129,1,40,ISFJ,16,"<no>  I am more comfortable working individually than working in a group. If you think it's absolutely necessary, you can participate in group activities, but most of the cases are not, so I'm not participating."
7697,129,1,40,ISFJ,17,"<neutrality>  I don't think any story has an ending. I prefer a closed ending, but in the end, I think it's also an open ending, not an ending."
7698,129,1,40,ISFJ,18,<Yes>  It is because I can eventually grow myself by helping others succeed. I don't think I can help others succeed without my own growth.
7699,129,1,40,ISFJ,19,"<neutrality>  I tend to focus on several things rather than one, but I work according to the natural stream of consciousness."
7700,129,1,40,ISFJ,20,<Yes>  am often worried that things will go wrong. Sometimes you see me worrying too much. I seem to get anxious easily when things don't go the way I thought.
7701,129,1,40,ISFJ,21,<Yes>  There seems to be a fear of taking great responsibility for something. There seems to be a fear of not being able to complete things perfectly.
7702,129,1,40,ISFJ,22,<Yes>  I don't think I have that tendency because I'm not very interested in artistic things and I haven't expressed them well.
7703,129,1,40,ISFJ,23,"<no>  Sometimes it seems that emotions save people more than reason. Reason should be valued, but emotions are also a very important part of our lives."
7704,129,1,40,ISFJ,24,<Yes>  Because taking a break after finishing housework is a real break. Taking a break before finishing is not comfortable even if you rest.
7705,129,1,40,ISFJ,25,<no>  don't like it because there are a lot of arguments in which each other only asserts their opinions. I don't enjoy the debate itself.
7706,129,1,40,ISFJ,26,<Yes>  I tend to do things that need to be done quietly rather than attracting other people's attention. I feel burdened by the attention of others or the attention that comes to me.
7707,129,1,40,ISFJ,27,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation, but I tend to try to control my emotions on my own. Even if you get angry with someone, you control your emotions again at that moment and try to understand the other person."
7708,129,1,40,ISFJ,28,"<Yes>  It hurts my heart when I see people who work inefficiently when they can handle things efficiently. It's convenient when you do laundry if you sort and divide the laundry in advance, but it's annoying to see you keep mixing them all in one place."
7709,129,1,40,ISFJ,29,"<Yes>  What you need to do but don't want to do, you put off until the end. I have to fold the laundry, but I'm putting it off to do it before bed."
7710,129,1,40,ISFJ,30,"<Yes>  think there is an afterlife, so I tend to look at those questions with interest."
7711,129,1,40,ISFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I like and enjoy my time alone, but I also like to spend time with my close friends. Unless that time is too long."
7712,129,1,40,ISFJ,32,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on which theory. I wouldn't be bored if it was a field I'm interested in, but I would be bored in a field I'm not interested in."
7713,129,1,40,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on what situation you are in. Even if the background is completely different, there are issues that can be sympathized with, and even if the background is the same, there are issues that are not sympathetic. It seems to depend on the situation and who it is rather than the background."
7714,129,1,40,ISFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to spend quite a bit of time before making a decision. I don't make decisions easily, so I think about it until the end and make a decision."
7715,129,1,40,ISFJ,35,"<Yes>  I tend to think a lot about problems before making decisions, so I tend not to think about decisions I have already made. Because if you think twice, you will make the same decision."
7716,129,1,40,ISFJ,36,"<no>  It's fun at first when I go to places with a lot of people, but I tend to get tired easily. I tend to recharge my energy through alone time."
7717,129,1,40,ISFJ,37,<no> Art is not a field of interest and I do not enjoy it because I do not have knowledge about it.
7718,129,1,40,ISFJ,38,"<no>  It's not hard to understand because I think it might be. But I don't bother trying to understand something I don't understand. It's just different from me, so I understand that you might feel that way."
7719,129,1,40,ISFJ,39,"<Yes>  I know things won't always go as planned, but I tend to organize my to-dos for the day in the morning."
7720,129,1,40,ISFJ,40,"<no>  often feel insecure I tend to worry a lot, and those worries often create anxiety. It seems to be an innate tendency."
7721,129,1,40,ISFJ,41,<Yes>  I don't like talking on the phone and it's hard to carry on a conversation when I can't see my face.
7722,129,1,40,ISFJ,42,"<Yes>  After meeting someone who had the exact opposite opinion on a political issue, I had time to think about why that person thought that way."
7723,129,1,40,ISFJ,43,"<neutrality>  In the case of close friends, they sometimes call to meet first, but most of them are on the side of receiving calls. The meeting time is fixed, so it doesn't matter who contacts first."
7724,129,1,40,ISFJ,44,"<Yes>  There was a deadline when there was a deadline, but while I was working, other things kept popping up and the schedule was misaligned. So, I took more time and completed the work before the deadline through additional work."
7725,129,1,40,ISFJ,45,"<neutrality>  I often wonder if I would have a better life now if I hadn't made mistakes in the past. However, since I can't change the past anyway, I'm on the side of trying to live without regrets."
7726,129,1,40,ISFJ,46,"<neutrality>  I live according to the flow of everyday life, but sometimes I think about human existence and the reason for living. When you know the existence of human beings and the reason for living, your daily life seems to become deeper."
7727,129,1,40,ISFJ,47,"<neutrality>  Rather than controlling my emotions, I tend to try to control them. Sometimes I feel emotions that I can't control, but even after such emotions, I try to understand the situation by collecting my thoughts and emotions again."
7728,129,1,40,ISFJ,48,<Yes>  Because the other side thinks it might be. Because I too make mistakes or mistakes.
7741,130,0,20,ESFJ,1,"<neutrality> Rather than making friends periodically, I do not shake off the upcoming ties in a given environment and make them well."
7742,130,0,20,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, I am interested in car specifications and design to buy a car, so I use my free time to search through YouTube or Naver."
7743,130,0,20,ESFJ,3,"<no>  I don't want to cry with you, I feel like I want to find the cause of the crying and solve it."
7744,130,0,20,ESFJ,4,"<Yes>  Because I know that things don't go as planned, I tend to have a thorough plan B."
7745,130,0,20,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  I try to keep my composure because I know it won't matter as time passes. Although they have been under pressure for their experimental performance lately, they have solved the problem with a prepared plan."
7746,130,0,20,ESFJ,6,"<neutrality>  Of course, the beginning is to start a conversation with someone you know, but it is a place to naturally communicate with new people and introduce each other."
7747,130,0,20,ESFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I just want to quit and start something new. However, there were many overlapping tasks, so when it was about 80% done, I would start a new project."
7748,130,0,20,ESFJ,8,<no>  I usually try to see things as they are. Because that is the only way you can see the real you.
7749,130,0,20,ESFJ,9,<Yes>  write in my diary every morning and make sure my plans are working. The most used ones are handwritten diaries and iPhone notepads.
7750,130,0,20,ESFJ,10,"<neutrality>  When the results of an experiment do not come out as desired, I often doubt my ability if the cause is a minor mistake on my part. However, it seems that there was little to doubt about the problem of the experimental equipment."
7751,130,0,20,ESFJ,11,"<Yes>  think there are similarities in the way we have lived our lives. When you ask questions and listen to the relevant parts, new questions arise, and as these things are repeated, it seems that the conversation opens up."
7752,130,0,20,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  The intention of the original author of a work of art is one, and it is an area that has already been revealed, so I do not think it is meaningful to try to interpret this part anew."
7753,130,0,20,ESFJ,13,<Yes>  I felt empirically that it was the fairest when judged rationally. The evaluation of the surroundings was similar.
7754,130,0,20,ESFJ,14,"<no>  Even when I wanted to leave spontaneously, it seems that I made a plan with a somewhat large outline and moved."
7755,130,0,20,ESFJ,15,"<no>  I think how I look to others is very important. The reason is that when evaluating a person, the evaluation is made by combining really diverse parts."
7756,130,0,20,ESFJ,16,"<Yes>  Recently, I have been actively participating in the research team's soccer club, and as I participate, I am more and more interested."
7757,130,0,20,ESFJ,17,"<no>  I like clear conclusions. I like genres that have a clear connection, like the recent movie 'Top Gun'."
7758,130,0,20,ESFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I think my success comes first, but I think my thoughts may change if the other person is a family member or someone I cherish."
7759,130,0,20,ESFJ,19,<no>  I have experienced fatigue when I have too many interests. I like to dig deep into the interests of a few.
7760,130,0,20,ESFJ,20,"<neutrality>  It depends on the field. I worry a lot about the parts that can directly affect the future, but if it's a trivial part, I'm the type of person who just ignores it."
7761,130,0,20,ESFJ,21,"<no>  In fact, I have a lot of experience working as a leader. Maybe it's because I haven't seen a leader-like person in my previous experience."
7762,130,0,20,ESFJ,22,"<Yes> After graduating from science and engineering, the work I am currently doing is also an experiment, so I think I have little artistic inclination."
7763,130,0,20,ESFJ,23,<no>  I think it's always a problem to lean to one side. I think the world has developed because emotions and reason have been valued in a balanced way.
7764,130,0,20,ESFJ,24,<Yes>  He is the type of person who finishes everything for the sake of rest. The reason is that it is more painful to see what needs to be done while resting.
7765,130,0,20,ESFJ,25,"<Yes>  It's interesting to hear what others have to say about why, logically, rather than just talking about an argument."
7766,130,0,20,ESFJ,26,"<Yes>  Anything that draws attention gets too much attention and I hate it. Therefore, it seems to be closer to the side of subtly appealing to the presence in the organization."
7767,130,0,20,ESFJ,27,<no>  They usually keep their emotions calm. I tend not to be emotionally agitated for anything.
7768,130,0,20,ESFJ,28,"<neutrality>  When I see people who work very inefficiently, there are some uncomfortable parts, but they don't seem to be annoyed."
7769,130,0,20,ESFJ,29,<no>  I never procrastinate because I feel comfortable when I finish what I have to do.
7770,130,0,20,ESFJ,30,"<no>  As the world we live in is interesting enough and has many fun elements, I don't think it's interesting to ask questions about the afterlife."
7771,130,0,20,ESFJ,31,"<Yes>  Spending time alone is good, but spending time with others recharges your energy."
7772,130,0,20,ESFJ,32,"<no>  Usually, I don't think it's boring because most things are implemented as the theory is applied."
7773,130,0,20,ESFJ,33,"<neutrality>  It's hard to empathize easily, but when I think of my colleagues, I think I can go to the stage where I can empathize as I spend time with many conversations."
7774,130,0,20,ESFJ,34,"<no>  I try to make a decision as quickly as possible, and after making a decision, I try to move it quickly."
7775,130,0,20,ESFJ,35,"<no>  Even if a decision has already been made, it seems that I always worry about whether the choice was right. The reason is to make the job go well."
7776,130,0,20,ESFJ,36,"<neutrality> Recently, there have been a lot of family events and acquaintances' gatherings, but I think it was the best combination for me after meeting people every other week and having time alone."
7777,130,0,20,ESFJ,37,"<no>  I have seen art works, such as art galleries and musicals, a few times, but I don't think I'm very interested."
7778,130,0,20,ESFJ,38,"<no>  When I talk to people, I tend to understand their emotions easily. I hear that people around me have excellent empathy skills."
7779,130,0,20,ESFJ,39,"<Yes> Take time to plan your work and personal matters at the beginning of the day, and organize them at the end of the day."
7780,130,0,20,ESFJ,40,<Yes>  I think it's because I inherited my parents' personality at the same time as my natural tendency. They usually do not feel anxious and try to maintain emotional stability.
7781,130,0,20,ESFJ,41,<no>  Phone calls are preferred because they are a more accurate and faster means of communication than KakaoTalk or text messages.
7782,130,0,20,ESFJ,42,"<neutrality>  usually try to understand, but I have experienced giving up when I think it takes too much time."
7783,130,0,20,ESFJ,43,"<neutrality>  At a rate of 50%, it seems to be the opposite rate of the rate of contacting my friend to meet."
7784,130,0,20,ESFJ,44,<Yes>  I have experience in reorganizing the experiment by returning to the original plan when the experiment did not produce the desired result.
7785,130,0,20,ESFJ,45,"<neutrality> There are definitely times to regret. However, I try not to think too long since I realized that thinking this way doesn't help me."
7786,130,0,20,ESFJ,46,"<neutrality>  Lately, I've been thinking shallowly about why I exist in the world and why I live, but I try not to think deeply."
7787,130,0,20,ESFJ,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions well. He is evaluated as a smile man who is always smiling around him.
7788,130,0,20,ESFJ,48,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the type of fault. I try to save face for minor mistakes, but I think it is a better choice to clearly point out mistakes that can lead directly to accidents."
7801,131,0,30,INFJ,1,"<no>  I don't necessarily try to find new friends. The reason is that I want to make new friends, but I think it's more important to get along well with friends I already know."
7802,131,0,30,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  I devote a lot of my free time to my interests. The weather has suddenly become chilly these days, so I'm interested in health and how to dress appropriately for the weather."
7803,131,0,30,INFJ,3,"<no> Even if I see someone else crying, I don't think I'll want to cry with them unless it's for a reason I sympathize with. If you see someone else crying, you may feel sad or sorry for them, but I don't think you want to cry with them simply by seeing them cry without a reason to sympathize with them."
7804,131,0,30,INFJ,4,"<neutrality>  usually only make backups if things are likely to go wrong. For example, if you plan to go on a trip and a typhoon comes, you make preparations such as finding places to enjoy indoors, but under normal circumstances, you do not anticipate that things will go wrong and make preparations."
7805,131,0,30,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  tend to maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. Recently, there was a case where I was late for an appointment due to a sudden rush to an appointment with an important person in my work. He seems to be trying to keep his composure even though he is anxious and impatient because he thinks he is at increased risk."
7806,131,0,30,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  seem to be looking for people I know mostly at parties and gatherings. If the purpose of the meeting or event was sales or something else, you would greet new people, but in general social gatherings, it is easier to talk to people you already know than to meet new people, and to know more than to know a lot of people. I think it's more important to manage the people who are there, so I don't think I'll introduce myself to new people unless I have a purpose."
7807,131,0,30,INFJ,7,"<neutrality>  prefer to start another project after completely completing one project, but since there are many cases where I have to do other things in the middle of the situation, I adjust according to the surrounding situation."
7808,131,0,30,INFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I consider myself a little more sentimental than the average male my age. The reason is that there are many acquaintances who like to appreciate art, such as going to concerts or exhibitions, but I think I was just genetically born that way."
7809,131,0,30,INFJ,9,"<neutrality>  I love to make plans, but I do most of them in my head, and less often organize them in a diary or electronic tool."
7810,131,0,30,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  basically don't think that most of what I know is certain. Most common knowledge is often obtained through media such as TV or the Internet rather than through direct experience, and in the case of knowledge obtained in this way, even if it is news or what a person with a social position says, it may be different from the truth. I don't think that the knowledge I know is certain."
7811,131,0,30,INFJ,11,"<no> I'm basically an introvert, and I'm shy, so even if I'm interested, I rarely approach and talk to people I'm seeing for the first time, and it's not easy. When I'm talking to someone I'm interested in, I usually start off with a casual topic like the weather, and after that, it seems like we're talking in the direction of finding common interests. And when I approach and talk to them first, there are many cases where I have a good feeling for them, so I tend to agree with them even if I'm not interested in what they say."
7812,131,0,30,INFJ,12,"<neutrality>  find it interesting and interesting to discuss different interpretations of works of art. However, I don't like to talk to people who aren't very interested in art or rude people who think they're right unconditionally, so I usually have discussions with people I know, and I rarely have discussions with people I don't know well. I prefer to listen rather than express my opinion."
7813,131,0,30,INFJ,13,"<neutrality>  I am usually rational, but in difficult and complex situations I tend to follow my emotions. It seems that the evaluation around me is a little more emotional than I thought."
7814,131,0,30,INFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to like to plan my day, but I don't plan in detail and deal with the situation from time to time."
7815,131,0,30,INFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to worry a lot about who I look to other people. The reason I thought so was because I felt comfortable when I went to a place where there were many people mentally, even though it was uncomfortable to wear a mask because of the corona."
7816,131,0,30,INFJ,16,"<no>  It's okay to do group activities with people I'm close to, but I'm uncomfortable doing group activities with people I'm not close to. The more people there are, the more likely it is that various variables will occur. Recently, I went on a trip to Jeju Island with three acquaintances during the holiday season."
7817,131,0,30,INFJ,17,"<neutrality>  I like books and movies with open endings, but I want to know the author's or director's clear thoughts or opinions, and sometimes I hate them because they feel unfinished."
7818,131,0,30,INFJ,18,"<Yes>  I seem to get more satisfaction out of helping others succeed than I do myself. The reason is that I'm not satisfied with anything, and it's good to see other people like it or be happy."
7819,131,0,30,INFJ,19,"<Yes>  Sometimes I pay attention here and there, but there are times when I can't do anything. Recently, while shopping on the Internet, there are cases where I wanted to buy all kinds of things, so I was worried and didn't buy anything."
7820,131,0,30,INFJ,20,<no>  I try to see things positively and I don't often worry about things going wrong.
7821,131,0,30,INFJ,21,"<Yes> I'm bad at coordinating and leading people, so I'd like to avoid taking on leadership roles."
7822,131,0,30,INFJ,22,"<no>  I like doing art activities such as exhibitions and orchestra performances, and I don't have a lot of artistic inclinations, but I think I have a little bit."
7823,131,0,30,INFJ,23,<neutrality>  I think emotions and reason should be in harmony. I don't think rational choices are efficient and better.
7824,131,0,30,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  If I have chores to do before going to bed, I like to finish them first. The reason is that you don't want to be disturbed while taking a break."
7825,131,0,30,INFJ,25,"<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. Arguments that try to find an unsentimental way are fine, but I feel bad for an argument that's emotional and contains profanity."
7826,131,0,30,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. That's why when you look at the clothes in your closet, most of them are achromatic clothes that are not noticeable."
7827,131,0,30,INFJ,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. If the mood is good, it tends to stay the same unless there is something special in the middle."
7828,131,0,30,INFJ,28,"<Yes>  Sometimes when I see someone who is not efficient, I understand the mind or situation, but there are times when I feel frustrated. For example, when cooking, you have to put the ingredients in order according to the set time, but when you see someone who is impatient and unnecessarily distracted, sometimes it's not annoying, but sometimes it's frustrating."
7829,131,0,30,INFJ,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. Even recently, when it comes to personal matters, I seem to set a time in my mind and put off the work until that time, then finish the work."
7830,131,0,30,INFJ,30,"<no>  I tend to think that death is the end, so I have little interest in the afterlife."
7831,131,0,30,INFJ,31,"<no>  like spending time with my close friends, but I also like and think it's necessary to spend time on my own without worrying about other people."
7832,131,0,30,INFJ,32,"<no>  I don't enjoy theory-centered, principled stories, but I think it's necessary because it's a basic foundation."
7833,131,0,30,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  seem to be able to empathize with people from different backgrounds than mine. Even if I do things that are difficult to understand because my inclination or background is completely different from mine, I think that if I grew up in that background, I could act similarly."
7834,131,0,30,INFJ,34,"<neutrality>  When I have a decision to make, I usually make it quickly. But complex decisions seem to be postponed."
7835,131,0,30,INFJ,35,"<neutrality>  tend not to think about decisions I've already made because nothing will change if I rethink them, but sometimes I imagine what it would be like if I made a different choice."
7836,131,0,30,INFJ,36,"<no>  When I think I'm tired, I prefer to relax by myself rather than meeting other people."
7837,131,0,30,INFJ,37,"<Yes>  like to go to art galleries often and appreciate works of art. Recently, I haven't been able to go often because of Corona, but the most recent thing I went to was the Michael Craig Martin exhibition exhibited at the Hangaram Art Museum in July."
7838,131,0,30,INFJ,38,"<no>  I usually don't find it difficult to understand other people's feelings. However, it is difficult to understand the feelings of a malicious person or a psychopath."
7839,131,0,30,INFJ,39,"<neutrality>  don't plan anything specific to do every day. The reason is that there are many repetitive things in the case of daily work, so I don't really plan, but I think I choose according to the situation or mood."
7840,131,0,30,INFJ,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure, and when I thought, it seems to be an innate tendency."
7841,131,0,30,INFJ,41,"<Yes>  avoid talking on the phone with people I don't know. There are too many useless phone calls these days, and I don't like talking on the phone with people I don't know because talking on the phone seems to be more emotional than writing or talking about useless things."
7842,131,0,30,INFJ,42,"<no>  If there is an opinion that is very different from mine, I tend to think it can be done even if it is difficult to understand, and I do not spend a lot of time in particular."
7843,131,0,30,INFJ,43,"<no>  sometimes contact my friends to meet up, but usually other friends contact me first."
7844,131,0,30,INFJ,44,"<no>  If my plan is disrupted, I change my plan depending on the situation. When I went to Jeju Island this holiday season, a typhoon suddenly came and I discarded the existing plan and re-planned and executed it focusing on what I could do indoors according to the situation."
7845,131,0,30,INFJ,45,<Yes>  often regret mistakes made a long time ago. The reason seems to be that there is an aspect of dissatisfaction with the current situation.
7846,131,0,30,INFJ,46,<no>  I often think about the reason for my existence and life. I often think about the reason for living in order to know what I want to do and what I should do.
7847,131,0,30,INFJ,47,"<neutrality>  usually control my emotions and don't show them, but sometimes I get emotional. People around me who don't know me very well or who haven't known me for a while think I'm rational, and people who've known me for a long time seem to think I'm a bit emotional."
7848,131,0,30,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  I tend to try to save face even when the other person is wrong. The reason is that if I were in the opposite situation, I think the other person would want to do this, and I think it's mutually better."
7861,132,1,40,ESTJ,1,<no>  I spend more time with my current friends than making new ones. The reason is that familiar people are more comfortable than meeting someone new.
7862,132,1,40,ESTJ,2,<no>  My interests are not diverse. I don't have any special interests and I like to meet people in my free time.
7863,132,1,40,ESTJ,3,"<Yes>  often cry with others when they cry. The reason is that there are times when I sympathize with him and cry, and when I see him crying, there are times when tears flow for no reason."
7864,132,1,40,ESTJ,4,"<no>  I don't make preparations in advance. The reason is not thinking in advance that things will go wrong, but thinking about what to do when things go wrong."
7865,132,1,40,ESTJ,5,"<neutrality>  I've rarely been under a lot of pressure. Even under pressure, I tend not to get nervous or anxious."
7866,132,1,40,ESTJ,6,<Yes>  I don't approach new people first. The reason is that I worry about what the other person will think of me and I don't know how to talk to them first.
7867,132,1,40,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  I finish what I was doing and do other things. The reason is that I can't multitask, so I can't concentrate when doing multiple things, so I finish one task and move on to the next."
7868,132,1,40,ESTJ,8,"<neutrality>  I am different from time to time. The reason is that it seems to be sentimental in small and trivial matters, but there are many times when it is rational in big things."
7869,132,1,40,ESTJ,9,<no>  I don't make any special plans. The reason is that there are many times when we set up a schedule according to the situation at the time and work improvisedly.
7870,132,1,40,ESTJ,10,"<no>  think everyone can make mistakes. No one is perfect, so even if you make a mistake, try not to repeat the same mistake next time."
7871,132,1,40,ESTJ,11,"<neutrality>  At first, I don't talk easily, but when I have common interests, I open up and talk."
7872,132,1,40,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  I don't know much about art and I'm not very interested in it, so I don't interpret or discuss it."
7873,132,1,40,ESTJ,13,<neutrality> Sometimes I'm emotional and sometimes I'm rational. It seems to depend on the situation.
7874,132,1,40,ESTJ,14,<Yes>  I prefer doing what I want to do at the time rather than planning something. I don't like making a frame called a plan.
7875,132,1,40,ESTJ,15,"<neutrality>  I'm not always like that, but sometimes I worry about what the other person will think of me. There is no special reason, but it seems to be because of a slightly timid personality."
7876,132,1,40,ESTJ,16,<no>  I don't find group activities on my own. I don't like to go out and it's burdensome to work with a large number of people.
7877,132,1,40,ESTJ,17,<no>  I like that the ending is fixed. Because what if it ends without an ending? There are thoughts and things that are hard to understand.
7878,132,1,40,ESTJ,18,<no>  am more satisfied and proud when I succeed in something than when others succeed. I love the sense of accomplishment that comes when you achieve something.
7879,132,1,40,ESTJ,19,<no>  I don't have a lot of interests so there's never a time when I don't know what to do.
7880,132,1,40,ESTJ,20,"<no>  Even if things go wrong, I don't worry too much because I can do it again or find another way."
7881,132,1,40,ESTJ,21,<Yes>  am ashamed to stand in front of others. I have the burden of being the only one paying attention and the worry that I might make a mistake.
7882,132,1,40,ESTJ,22,"<Yes>  I consider myself a person far from art. I feel that it is very difficult to draw or create, and I feel that I lack creativity."
7883,132,1,40,ESTJ,23,<no>  do not believe that people must make rational judgments to make the world a better place. I don't think that making a rational decision doesn't necessarily mean that you only get good results in certain things.
7884,132,1,40,ESTJ,24,"<Yes>  It's something I have to do anyway, so it's comfortable to finish it quickly and take a break."
7885,132,1,40,ESTJ,25,"<no>  I don't like to raise my voice and argue. I am a person who believes that good is good, so I like to tune in and share opinions."
7886,132,1,40,ESTJ,26,<Yes>  am burdened by other people's eyes. I'm ashamed to get people's attention.
7887,132,1,40,ESTJ,27,"<no>  My feelings don't change much. Unless you're really angry or anything, you don't have big emotional ups and downs."
7888,132,1,40,ESTJ,28,"<neutrality>  I myself am sometimes inefficient, so I don't get annoyed when I see people like that. But sometimes when you want to do it too much, you get annoyed."
7889,132,1,40,ESTJ,29,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. When you do something you don't want to do, there are times when you put it off until you can put it off."
7890,132,1,40,ESTJ,30,<no>  I have no interest in the afterlife. I don't wonder if it's because I think it's the end when a person dies.
7891,132,1,40,ESTJ,31,<Yes>  I tend to be lonely a lot. So I feel happy when I am with someone.
7892,132,1,40,ESTJ,32,<Yes>  I'm not interested in theories. This is because theory is only theory and often differs from reality.
7893,132,1,40,ESTJ,33,"<no>  I think if you come from a different background than me, you think differently. I don't think I can sympathize 100% because the environment I've lived in is different and my experience is different."
7894,132,1,40,ESTJ,34,<Yes>  It's very difficult for me to decide what to do. So I tend to think a lot and make decisions.
7895,132,1,40,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  I don't look back at decisions I've already made. It's already been decided, so I can't go back, and I tend not to regret it whether it goes well or not."
7896,132,1,40,ESTJ,36,"<Yes>  Rather than spending time alone, meeting people and chatting or traveling is the energy of my life."
7897,132,1,40,ESTJ,37,"<no>  I don't have much interest in painting and I don't know much artistically, so I don't like to visit."
7898,132,1,40,ESTJ,38,<no>  I think that each person feels differently. So try to understand the other person's feelings.
7899,132,1,40,ESTJ,39,"<no>  I don't like to plan anything. At that time, work or decide according to the situation."
7900,132,1,40,ESTJ,40,<Yes>  I don't feel particularly anxious or have much to do. It seems to be an innate tendency.
7901,132,1,40,ESTJ,41,"<no> I'm not the type to call often. However, I do not intentionally avoid or avoid phone calls."
7902,132,1,40,ESTJ,42,"<no>  Just because your opinion differs from mine, I don't spend my time trying to understand it. I think it's just his opinion and I don't think about it anymore."
7903,132,1,40,ESTJ,43,"<no>  I'm not very good at contacting you in the first place. It's so nice to be contacted, but I don't think I'm going to contact you first."
7904,132,1,40,ESTJ,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, I think of other alternatives and do not try to go back to the previous plan."
7905,132,1,40,ESTJ,45,"<no>  Mistakes made a long time ago are already in the past, so I tend to try not to make the same mistakes rather than regret them."
7906,132,1,40,ESTJ,46,"<Yes>  I didn't think deeply about human existence. I'm just alive, so it seems like I'm living trying to maintain life."
7907,132,1,40,ESTJ,47,<no>  Don't be swayed by other people's feelings. I think I'm on the side of trying to control my emotions.
7908,132,1,40,ESTJ,48,"<no>  When the other person is wrong, point out and talk about it. There are times when the other person doesn't know what they did wrong, so I tell them objectively."
7921,133,1,30,INTP,1,"<no>  don't make it on purpose, except for the friends I've met at school or at work. It's because the more people you know, the more energy you have to pour into it."
7922,133,1,30,INTP,2,"<Yes>  I am naturally curious, so I like to look into things. While browsing YouTube, if there is something that looks interesting, I will watch it, but these days I often watch movie introduction channels."
7923,133,1,30,INTP,3,"<no> Unless there is a specific context about the situation before and after that, there is not much inspiration with just a fragmentary image of a person crying."
7924,133,1,30,INTP,4,"<Yes>  Even if it is not a variety of preparations, plan A and B are prepared. This is because if you think of only one countermeasure and then a variable occurs, you may get flustered and miss work."
7925,133,1,30,INTP,5,"<Yes>  I tend not to panic even under pressure. Due to the nature of work, work can be crowded all at once on the same deadline, so you can solve it as quickly as possible by first working on the work that takes time to receive confirmation and then requesting approval, and then processing the rest of the work that does not require approval while the approval is completed. keep it under control."
7926,133,1,30,INTP,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk mainly to people I know well. It's because I don't want to meet a new person who doesn't have information, and I don't want to pour energy to get to know him."
7927,133,1,30,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  If it's not complicated, I tend to do it simultaneously, but if it's complicated and needs attention, I tend to finish it to some extent first and then move on to the next project."
7928,133,1,30,INTP,8,"<no>  Usually, rather than being sentimental about a situation, I tend to think about how to solve the situation first."
7929,133,1,30,INTP,9,"<no>  I think about the big frame to some extent, and the rest of the specific parts proceed flexibly depending on the situation at the time. Therefore, I only write down what time it is on the calendar and think about the rest of the details at that time."
7930,133,1,30,INTP,10,"<no>  Everyone can make mistakes, and I don't think you can sell the whole thing just because you made a few mistakes."
7931,133,1,30,INTP,11,"<no>  Basically, you don't know what to say to someone you don't know first, and you don't start talking in the first place unless it's clear later that you have common interests."
7932,133,1,30,INTP,12,"<no>  don't believe there is a set answer for a particular subject, so I like to compare different interpretations from different perspectives."
7933,133,1,30,INTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. There are times when there is a difference between following the heart and following the head, because it is usually better for the future to choose the one that follows the head. But I'm not sure what the people around me think."
7934,133,1,30,INTP,14,"<Yes> Rather than planning a schedule for the day, I open my eyes and do what I want to do as soon as I think of it."
7935,133,1,30,INTP,15,"<Yes>  I don't care about other people's eyes. No matter what other people think, I'm not the type to allow it to affect my life."
7936,133,1,30,INTP,16,"<no>  I prefer to work alone. Because having multiple people makes you tired. Therefore, offline club activities are not conducted at all."
7937,133,1,30,INTP,17,"<Yes>  No matter who sees it, I prefer works that allow multiple interpretations rather than fixed endings. For this same reason, my favorite movie is Nolan's 'Memento'."
7938,133,1,30,INTP,18,"<no>  I prioritize my life over the success of others. It's a complicated life, but I can't afford to care about other people."
7939,133,1,30,INTP,19,"<Yes> The time given in a day is limited, but I often worry about it because I can't play Netflix, YouTube, and games at the same time."
7940,133,1,30,INTP,20,"<no>  I think it's impossible to have everything in life go well. So, it's only natural that things can go wrong, and if things don't work out the way you think, it's okay to think about the next best thing."
7941,133,1,30,INTP,21,"<Yes> The role of a leader comes with a lot of responsibility and a lot of work, but I hate troublesome things, so I want to avoid them."
7942,133,1,30,INTP,22,"<no>  Ever since I was young, I've been told many times that arts and sports would be more suitable for me."
7943,133,1,30,INTP,23,"<no> Regardless of my personal inclination, I believe it is difficult to create a better world with reason alone. Reason should act as a tool, because when it becomes the main thing, it is no different from a machine. If you think that only machines and gears roll, the underprivileged will inevitably be abandoned by utilitarianism, but I don't think that's the right world."
7944,133,1,30,INTP,24,"<Yes>  I tend to finish the chores first because if there are still chores left in my heart, I can't take a full rest."
7945,133,1,30,INTP,25,<Yes>  stand by the sidelines of arguments because I can get a glimpse of someone else's point of view through their arguments and supporting opinions.
7946,133,1,30,INTP,26,<Yes>  Doesn't like to attract attention. I prefer to be without a presence as if it were just there.
7947,133,1,30,INTP,27,"<no>  When a situation arises, it is not the first thing to feel about it, but to figure out the situation and think about how to react first. After that, the reaction comes out accordingly, so the emotional response is one beat slower."
7948,133,1,30,INTP,28,"<no>  I'm just not impressed with how other people behave, because I don't think it matters."
7949,133,1,30,INTP,29,"<Yes>  I prefer to cram. In terms of business, I'm not the only one working, so I do it in advance to some extent, but if it's not related to someone else, I'll take care of it at the last minute."
7950,133,1,30,INTP,30,<Yes>  think the afterlife is also interesting because it is a topic that is bound to have various interpretations and perspectives.
7951,133,1,30,INTP,31,"<no>  By nature, I prefer to be alone, so I avoid spending time with other people."
7952,133,1,30,INTP,32,"<no>  No matter how basic a story is, I think it is absurd to move on to the next one without discussing it anyway, so I think theory-centered discussions are also important."
7953,133,1,30,INTP,33,"<no>  If the environment is completely different, it is difficult to empathize because it is difficult to empathize."
7954,133,1,30,INTP,34,<no>  I tend to make decisions as quickly as possible because I have to make a decision before I can think about what comes next.
7955,133,1,30,INTP,35,"<Yes> Looking back at a decision once made is also time consuming, so I tend to stick with it once I've made it. It's because if you keep in mind the road you didn't go, your ankles will be caught and you will only see the past."
7956,133,1,30,INTP,36,"<no>  It's better to go somewhere alone. This is because just participating in a party or event does not relieve fatigue, but rather builds it up."
7957,133,1,30,INTP,37,"<Yes> The museum itself is quiet and comfortable, and I like viewing the work because I can see the perspective of the artist who painted it."
7958,133,1,30,INTP,38,"<Yes>  Especially in dramas and movies, there are times when you don't understand the situation between a man and a woman. There are times when you want to check the other person's feelings, but I'm not sure why you feel so desperate for that."
7959,133,1,30,INTP,39,"<no>  That day, go to the day and look at the situation and judge. I don't feel the need to make a specific schedule."
7960,133,1,30,INTP,40,<Yes>  I rarely feel insecure. I think it's just because I'm optimistic from the beginning.
7961,133,1,30,INTP,41,<Yes>  I just don't like having contact with other people. Including face-to-face as well as phone calls.
7962,133,1,30,INTP,42,"<no>  If you have a different opinion than mine, I'll just skip it. In other words, 'it could be' seems stronger."
7963,133,1,30,INTP,43,"<no>  Since meeting and doing something itself is a matter of pouring energy, I don't bother calling first until someone asks to meet."
7964,133,1,30,INTP,44,"<neutrality>  I do it when it's better to go back to my original plan, but sometimes I just go the other way when I feel like it doesn't have to go the way I originally thought."
7965,133,1,30,INTP,45,"<no>  Once a decision is made, it is unlikely to be reviewed again. So no regrets."
7966,133,1,30,INTP,46,"<neutrality>  When I'm busy, there are times when I'm just living my life and I don't think about anything, but sometimes I ponder what life is and why it's so hard."
7967,133,1,30,INTP,47,"<no>  When going through a situation, I tend to try to choose the best way regardless of how I feel about the situation. I've never heard of anyone being emotional."
7968,133,1,30,INTP,48,"<no>  don't deliberately report wrongdoing, but I don't even bother trying to save face. It is up to the other party to take responsibility for the mistake."
7981,134,1,20,ENTJ,1,<neutrality>  I think I tend to make new friends regularly. The reason is because it's fun to talk to new people and be active based on your interests from time to time.
7982,134,1,20,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  large portion of my free time is devoted to exploring a variety of interests. The reason is that learning new things feels like fun. These days, I'm interested in tennis, so I'm taking lessons twice a week."
7983,134,1,20,ENTJ,3,<no>  I don't often want to cry when I see someone else cry. The reason is that we believe that crying along with others cannot solve the problem.
7984,134,1,20,ENTJ,4,<Yes>  I have several contingency plans in case things go wrong. The reason is because I don't like having other work disrupted by sudden circumstances. And because I don't want to create an embarrassing situation where my plans change and I have to rush things.
7985,134,1,20,ENTJ,5,"<Yes>  tend to maintain my composure even under pressure. The reason is that what I am doing right now is a job where there is a high chance of making mistakes if I am not focused, so I am feeling pressured, but I am trying to keep my composure."
7986,134,1,20,ENTJ,6,<Yes>  I usually talk to people I already know. The reason is that you want to first understand the atmosphere of the party or event while talking to someone you already know and adopt an appropriate attitude.
7987,134,1,20,ENTJ,7,"<Yes>  I tend to complete one project before starting another. The reason is that you think that doing multiple things at once increases the chance of making mistakes. When I was given multiple tasks at once while working, I had a hard time handling them without hesitation."
7988,134,1,20,ENTJ,8,"<no>  I don't think I'm sentimental. The reason is that I don't have many memories of being greatly moved by a certain work. Even in everyday life, I tend to use logic and reason first to judge situations rather than sentimentality."
7989,134,1,20,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  like to make plans with a schedule or list. The reason is that when a plan is in place, what I need to do next becomes clear and I feel like things are on track. So, I have been writing a diary regularly."
7990,134,1,20,ENTJ,10,"<no>  I don't think I doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. The reason is that I usually believe in myself and have the confidence that I am doing well, so I don't think I'm too obsessed with trivial mistakes."
7991,134,1,20,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  It's not difficult for me to approach and strike up a conversation with someone I'm interested in. The reason is that I don't think I'm going to treat people differently from other people because I'm interested in them. I don't show off to that person, so I tend to have conversations thinking that I can just do it the way I do to others."
7992,134,1,20,ENTJ,12,"<no>  I am interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. The reason is that when you appreciate a work from multiple perspectives, you can find hidden meanings that cannot be thought of from one perspective, and I think that helps to understand the work more deeply."
7993,134,1,20,ENTJ,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. The reason is that I think rational judgment can solve things neatly. It seems that the evaluation of the surroundings is similar to the judgment of the person.
7994,134,1,20,ENTJ,14,"<no>  like to work on a schedule for the day. The reason is that it is comfortable to move according to a plan. Sometimes it's fun to improvise what you want to do, but if you do that all your life, you'll be embarrassed because there are many unexpected situations."
7995,134,1,20,ENTJ,15,"<Yes>  think I tend not to worry about who I look to other people. The reason is that in the end, I think and move as I set my mind. It's not that I don't care about other people's eyes, but I don't think I'm the type to be easily swayed by other people's opinions. I ask for advice from people around me, but in the end I decide according to my thoughts."
7996,134,1,20,ENTJ,16,"<Yes>  enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is because I think that doing something with others is more fun and more efficient than doing it alone. However, I don't often participate in group activities these days."
7997,134,1,20,ENTJ,17,"<Yes>  like books and movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. The reason is that I can expand my thoughts in many directions through my work, and discover a new me in the process. So, my recent favorite book is 'A Thousand Blues' by Cheon Seon-ran."
7998,134,1,20,ENTJ,18,"<no>  find satisfaction in helping others succeed, but I consider myself a person who finds greater satisfaction in my own success. The reason is because I think that I can help others succeed only when I succeed. That's why I think it's a bit of a paradox to be helping someone else succeed when you're not succeeding."
7999,134,1,20,ENTJ,19,"<Yes>  have so many interests that sometimes I don't know what to do next. Recently, I've been thinking about whether to play tennis, get petty, or take musical instrument lessons. There are so many other things I want to do that I often wonder where to start."
8000,134,1,20,ENTJ,20,"<no>  don't think I'm the type to worry about things going wrong. Rather than having a special reason, if I did my best, the next situation is not something that can be decided by my will, and worrying won't solve the problem, so I tend to choose a way to find something else I can do."
8001,134,1,20,ENTJ,21,"<no>  do not wish to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group. The reason is that it is easier for me to become a leader and give instructions and help to others than to be instructed by someone else, and I do not think that taking on a leadership role is something that should be avoided."
8002,134,1,20,ENTJ,22,"<Yes>  think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that you can't draw a picture as you think with your head, and the song isn't sung like your heart. I don't think I have the ability to explain my listening ears or my impressions of the work in a nice way."
8003,134,1,20,ENTJ,23,"<no>  don't think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. It's because I think the world can be desolate if there are too rational people. Because different people come together, I think fresh ideas can come out and interesting things can happen."
8004,134,1,20,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  like to finish my chores before going to bed. It's because it's comfortable to relax after all the work is done. Sometimes when I'm too tired, I might choose to take a break, but in most situations, I think it's more important to feel comfortable, so I prefer to take a break after work. Also, it's because I think that a break is sweeter when I'm done and rested, and I can rest more properly."
8005,134,1,20,ENTJ,25,"<Yes>  enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is because I think it's important to solve it properly and move on because there are many problems that happen again due to the situation when you just want to go over well. And in the process, it feels fun to compete with logic."
8006,134,1,20,ENTJ,26,"<Yes>  tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. When I do something, I tend to do it without showing it to others until it is completed. Even when I achieve something, I don't think I'm the first to announce it. I don't think I want to go ahead with the work while drawing attention to the thought that something that will be known will be known someday."
8007,134,1,20,ENTJ,27,"<no>  It seems to me that emotions rarely change very quickly. There are times when I get angry or excited, but I tend to try to stay calm as quickly as possible even in such situations."
8008,134,1,20,ENTJ,28,"<Yes>  I tend to get annoyed with people who aren't efficient. I don't express it directly to that person, but I've been angry when I've seen people do other things or waste energy where they don't need it while working together."
8009,134,1,20,ENTJ,29,"<no>  don't often put things off until the end. I tend to plan and prepare in advance, especially if I have to do it. Recently, I had a deadline for a task, but I finished it in advance because I thought that it would overlap with other tasks and I would not be able to fully concentrate on it."
8010,134,1,20,ENTJ,30,"<Yes>  I think the question of the afterlife is interesting. Because it is a world that no one who can have a conversation with alive has ever experienced, I am always curious about what exists behind death, and if so, what it is."
8011,134,1,20,ENTJ,31,"<Yes>  I would rather spend time with other people than alone. These days, it's especially like that. I need time to spend alone, but these days, I want to spend more time with other people because I want to experience new cultures through exchanges with people."
8012,134,1,20,ENTJ,32,"<no>  I don't think theory is everything, but that doesn't mean theory-centered discussions and principled stories are boring. I think the theory is definitely useful, so I think the process of discussing it in the theoretical part is important, but I don't have any particular experience that comes to mind right now."
8013,134,1,20,ENTJ,33,"<Yes>  I think I can easily relate to someone whose background is completely different from mine. If I think of myself as a different person, I think I can empathize with that person better. I think that no two people in the world can be exactly the same, and once you understand that you can think that way while meeting people who live in various ways, you can empathize with other people's situations."
8014,134,1,20,ENTJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone making decisions until the end. I tend to think through and make decisions at the end because I want to make the best possible decision, but sometimes it's easy to make a decision if the conclusion doesn't change much anyway."
8015,134,1,20,ENTJ,35,"<no>  try not to think twice about decisions I've already made, but it doesn't seem to work. I think I'm the type of person who keeps thinking and thinking and retracing to be sure of my choice to see if this was the right decision."
8016,134,1,20,ENTJ,36,"<no>  I tend to relieve the fatigue of the week through alone time. It's not intentional, but I don't have many parties or events in particular, so I spend a lot of time alone. However, spending time with people can sometimes fill you up with energy."
8017,134,1,20,ENTJ,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries or looking at works of art. I think I should go to the exhibition, but I haven't actually been to many. I don't have many opportunities to come across it, and I don't feel much interest."
8018,134,1,20,ENTJ,38,"<no> It's not often hard to understand other people's feelings themselves. However, it seems that I do not blindly sympathize with the situation. Bad feelings don't particularly want to be contagious, so they seem to put up a bit of a shield."
8019,134,1,20,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos. I think I tend to plan everything, both work and personal. Regardless of whether or not you actually stick to your plan, planning seems to make you feel better."
8020,134,1,20,ENTJ,40,"<neutrality>  don't often feel anxious, but it's not rare either. It's not like this with a special occasion, it just seems normal."
8021,134,1,20,ENTJ,41,<Yes>  There are some things you want to avoid making phone calls to as much as possible. It's because I don't think it's easy to react to the opponent's unexpected reaction in real time. And it's because the static that comes during a call feels awkward.
8022,134,1,20,ENTJ,42,"<no>  I don't spend that much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. If there is a difference of opinion, I tend to accept it immediately if I can understand it logically, and if I do not understand it, I will try to understand it."
8023,134,1,20,ENTJ,43,"<no>  I don't often contact my friends to meet up first. If necessary, I will contact you first, but I don't think there are many cases where you have to contact me to meet first, and it seems that there are more cases when friends ask to meet up after making a plan."
8024,134,1,20,ENTJ,44,"<Yes> If the plan is disrupted, we try to get back to it as quickly as possible. I don't think there were many situations where big problems arose because I prepared in advance in case there was a setback in the plan and even made plans for the next one."
8025,134,1,20,ENTJ,45,"<no>  There aren't many times when you regret making mistakes long ago. I don't have many regrets because I tend to erase old mistakes so that I can learn from them, but sometimes I do. If you have to look for it, it seems that there is such a side in the part like mistakes."
8026,134,1,20,ENTJ,46,"<no>  I tend to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. Human beings often worry about what and why they live, and how to live a life well lived."
8027,134,1,20,ENTJ,47,"<no>  think I tend to control my emotions. When I get emotional, I think I can't properly look at the problem and solve it, so I think I'm on the side of trying to control it, and I think the evaluation of the people around me is the same."
8028,134,1,20,ENTJ,48,"<Yes> Even when it is clear that it is the other person's fault, we try to save the other person's face. If it's not to break that person down, there's nothing good to be done by putting down the other person, so I think I'm on the side of trying to avoid a conflict situation by trying to make the person feel as bad as possible."
8041,135,0,30,ESFP,1,"<Yes>  I often make new friends because I often participate in new gatherings such as student councils, watching soccer, and clubs."
8042,135,0,30,ESFP,2,"<Yes> It seems that there is always something new to learn in life. Currently, my wife is 8 weeks pregnant, so I am studying parenting and childbirth."
8043,135,0,30,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  Because I work as a social worker, I often consult with them, but they tend to empathize easily, so they often cry with me. Even if you're not sad, emotions follow."
8044,135,0,30,ESFP,4,"<neutrality> Personally, I tend to act without worrying too much about what will happen later. However, as I recently got married and shared my thoughts with my wife, I realized the importance of preparing for the unexpected, so I am preparing several things."
8045,135,0,30,ESFP,5,"<no>  When difficult things come up or I get a little busy, it's difficult for me to keep my composure and I get dizzy. Last week, I was given several things at the same time at the company, but I felt dizzy because I couldn¡¯t organize them."
8046,135,0,30,ESFP,6,"<neutrality>  There are a lot of times I participate in new meetings, so it's not difficult to introduce myself. But as I get older, I need someone I can talk to, so it's better to talk to someone I know."
8047,135,0,30,ESFP,7,"<no>  It is difficult to set the order of work and I am very spontaneous, so if I lose my concentration while doing one thing, I take a break and do other things."
8048,135,0,30,ESFP,8,<neutrality>  I think I'm sentimental because I tend to act based on my feelings or the mood of the people around me rather than intuition or experience.
8049,135,0,30,ESFP,9,<no>  Planning itself feels like work and is stressful. I only write down important events on my smartphone calendar app and do not plan anything else.
8050,135,0,30,ESFP,10,"<Yes> As the ranks in the company increased, the responsibilities increased. The proportion of making mistakes also increased, and as I was scolded so often, there were times when I wondered if I had been promoted and occupied a position despite my incompetence."
8051,135,0,30,ESFP,11,"<Yes>  I started dating my now wife a month after I first got to know her. I'm nervous when I first start a conversation, but it's not difficult."
8052,135,0,30,ESFP,12,<Yes>  I don't think it's fun to interpret or discuss it because I'm not very inspired by looking at art works.
8053,135,0,30,ESFP,13,"<neutrality>  I try to think and act as rationally as possible, but I often act according to my current mood or emotions. I don't know how people around me evaluate it."
8054,135,0,30,ESFP,14,"<Yes> After marriage, impromptu work decreased, but before marriage, it seems that I tended to stay still and act as I thought. There were things that I was lying at home and just went to the end of any subway line or suddenly went to see the sea."
8055,135,0,30,ESFP,15,"<Yes>  In fact, when I was young, I acted without paying much attention, but at my previous job, I was misunderstood by many employees for my trivial actions, so I became cautious."
8056,135,0,30,ESFP,16,"<Yes> After getting married, the frequency of participation decreased, but now I voluntarily participate in various organizations such as K-League Suwon Samsung supporter activities, early soccer, baseball, and the chairman of the Mutual Aid Society at work."
8057,135,0,30,ESFP,17,"<Yes>  When I watch a movie or novel, I like to imagine the lives of the main characters after the ending. Even if the ending is definitely decided, I can't imagine it at will. For this reason, there is nothing good about a particular work."
8058,135,0,30,ESFP,18,"<Yes>  I am satisfied with my current job and the work I do is not too difficult. And my job is a social worker, and I mainly provide initial counseling and professional counseling services for the elderly. Every time I hear that the situation of the elderly people I care for has improved, I feel good."
8059,135,0,30,ESFP,19,"<no> Although I participate in various meetings, it is not too difficult as the field is mainly unified towards sports and small groups, not Jung-gu heating."
8060,135,0,30,ESFP,20,"<no>  Rather than worrying that things might go wrong, there are many things to regret after things have already gone wrong."
8061,135,0,30,ESFP,21,"<no>  don't prefer the role of leader, but I don't shy away from it because I think it'll be fun because it makes me friendly with new people or new things happen. I have held or currently serve as the president of the student body of a university, the president of a mutual aid society at the current workplace, and a member of the workers' side of the labor-management committee."
8062,135,0,30,ESFP,22,"<Yes>  I am not very inspired by art works, and I have difficulty in situations that require activities such as drawing or creating."
8063,135,0,30,ESFP,23,"<neutrality>  Whether people are emotional or rational, it doesn't seem to have had a big impact on how the world goes and develops."
8064,135,0,30,ESFP,24,"<no>  Housework is out of sight when you need a break. If I have to wash the dishes after dinner, I tend to go to bed and do it the next morning."
8065,135,0,30,ESFP,25,"<no>  I don't like being involved in conflict situations, and it's hard for me to see such things happening around me. I tend to get agitated easily."
8066,135,0,30,ESFP,26,"<neutrality>  tend to keep quiet as much as possible, but sometimes when I speak or act without thinking, I sometimes catch the attention of people around me."
8067,135,0,30,ESFP,27,"<no>  It's emotional, but it doesn't seem like the change of emotions is fast. Instead, when there is a conflict situation around you or something to be scolded for, you tend to look down easily."
8068,135,0,30,ESFP,28,"<no> Since I consider myself to be a very lacking person, I think I can be like that even if there are people like that around me. Because everyone has their own inclinations."
8069,135,0,30,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone it until I can postpone it as long as I can, and then work while regretting it. Recently, the account settlement date for the Community Chest of Korea was notified a month ago, but I didn't do it, but I did it 2 days ago."
8070,135,0,30,ESFP,30,<Yes> I've been curious since I was young. People have thought a lot about what happens after death.
8071,135,0,30,ESFP,31,"<Yes>  When I'm alone, I have nothing to do and I don't know what to do. At least, on days when my wife is not around, I just lie down."
8072,135,0,30,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  I tend to have a hard time understanding difficult words. I was not good at studying, and due to the nature of my job, I had to participate in meetings and outside education a lot, but I couldn¡¯t listen and understand at once."
8073,135,0,30,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  The job itself is training because you have to listen to and empathize with other people's stories. Even if I hear things that are different from my subjectivity or that I have never experienced, I tend to understand that I can do that."
8074,135,0,30,ESFP,34,"<neutrality>  I think about really important things until the moment I have to execute them, but I often regret making decisions on unimportant things right away without thinking."
8075,135,0,30,ESFP,35,<neutrality>  I don't think much about what has already happened because I can't do anything about it in the future.
8076,135,0,30,ESFP,36,"<Yes>  Before marriage, I lived by going to the soccer field every weekend or doing small group activities on weekdays. Now my wife is pregnant and I am refraining from meetings."
8077,135,0,30,ESFP,37,"<no>  Other than going to art galleries and museums for assignments or work, I personally rarely went there. I don't even go on a date."
8078,135,0,30,ESFP,38,<no>  It's not hard. I tend to think first of all how this person would talk or act like this if the environment he was in was like that.
8079,135,0,30,ESFP,39,<no>  I tend to only know the general flow of work and act as I think of it at that time.
8080,135,0,30,ESFP,40,"<no>  I have a personality that procrastinates, but that doesn't mean I'm comfortable. I worry a lot."
8081,135,0,30,ESFP,41,"<no> In the beginning of my social life, it was difficult to do business over the phone. But now, I don't avoid phone calls because the content is delivered quickly."
8082,135,0,30,ESFP,42,"<no>  When I hear other people's opinions, even if I don't immediately understand it in my head, I think I can do it in my heart. That way, it's quicker to understand other opinions than mine."
8083,135,0,30,ESFP,43,"<no>  In the case of clubs, the schedule is fixed, so I don't make a separate appointment, I don't make other appointments first, and I tend to follow when others call."
8084,135,0,30,ESFP,44,"<no>  I tend to give up easily when things go wrong with my plans. If it's a really important task or situation, I'll try to the minimum, but if it's not, I'll just let it go."
8085,135,0,30,ESFP,45,"<no>  I've definitely made a lot of mistakes and regretted it, but I guess my memory isn't good, so after a while, I forget the situation and the mood at that time."
8086,135,0,30,ESFP,46,"<Yes> I'm not the type to enjoy difficult content or situations. I'm really curious about death in the above questions, but I haven't thought about existence and life."
8087,135,0,30,ESFP,47,"<Yes>  It is difficult to control. I tend to get intimidated and depressed easily when I am in a difficult situation. Instead, don't get angry."
8088,135,0,30,ESFP,48,"<Yes>  don't try to put down or gossip about the other person because I think I'm lacking myself. When I witness such a situation, I tend not to talk about it or to talk about it separately later when the situation has passed."
8101,136,1,40,ESFP,1,"<<Yes>  I make new friends regularly. The reason is because I like meeting people, and I get along well with people I meet for the first time without any discomfort."
8102,136,1,40,ESFP,2,"<<Yes>  large portion of my free time is devoted to exploring a variety of interests. Recently, I have become interested in issues related to the law."
8103,136,1,40,ESFP,3,"<<Yes>  When I see someone else crying, I want to cry. It's because you are good at empathizing with that person's heart."
8104,136,1,40,ESFP,4,"<no>  I don't make preparations for when things go wrong. When things go wrong, we look for solutions."
8105,136,1,40,ESFP,5,<<Yes>  tend to maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. I try to control my mind so that I don't stress myself.
8106,136,1,40,ESFP,6,"<no>  I introduce myself first to new people at parties and events. The reason is that even if you meet new people, you are not unfamiliar."
8107,136,1,40,ESFP,7,"<no>  I don't start another project after fully completing one project. Even if you are working on a project, if another project arises, do it at the same time."
8108,136,1,40,ESFP,8,"<Yes>  I am very sentimental. When I listen to music or hear a good phrase, I feel very emotional and uplifted."
8109,136,1,40,ESFP,9,"<<neutral>  I am neither a fan of nor a dislike of making plans with schedules or lists. Sometimes I plan with a schedule or list. I write a diary only in the beginning and neglect it, and I enjoy using electronic tools."
8110,136,1,40,ESFP,10,<no>  You don't doubt your ability or knowledge with small mistakes. The reason is that everyone can make mistakes.
8111,136,1,40,ESFP,11,"<<Yes>  I find it easy to approach and start a conversation with someone I'm interested in. I have a comfortable impression, so I tend to approach others without being a burden."
8112,136,1,40,ESFP,12,<<Yes>  am not very interested in discussing the different interpretations of works of art. The reason is that I have no interest in art at all.
8113,136,1,40,ESFP,13,"<<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. Instead of getting angry when something happens, think about how it happened and how to fix it. We can't help what has already happened."
8114,136,1,40,ESFP,14,"<<Yes>  like to improvise and do what I want to do. When you improvise, you feel a greater sense of accomplishment and satisfaction."
8115,136,1,40,ESFP,15,<<neutral>  I think it's important to see what kind of person you are to others in your life. It's not something I'm too worried about though.
8116,136,1,40,ESFP,16,"<<Yes>  I enjoy participating in group activities. I don't have many opportunities these days, so I can't enjoy it much. But I like it."
8117,136,1,40,ESFP,17,<no>  I don't like books and movies where you can interpret the ending in your own way. I like to accept the ending given by the author.
8118,136,1,40,ESFP,18,<<Yes>  I find greater satisfaction in helping others succeed. I feel proud of seeing others succeed because of me.
8119,136,1,40,ESFP,19,<<No> There are never so many interests that you don't know what to do next. There is always one or two interests.
8120,136,1,40,ESFP,20,"<<No>  I don't often worry about things going wrong. If you did your best, you will have no regrets even if things go wrong, and you just have to find a solution."
8121,136,1,40,ESFP,21,<<Yes>  I would like to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group whenever possible. It's good to have a role to help the leader.
8122,136,1,40,ESFP,22,<<Yes>  think I have very little artistic inclination. Because I'm usually not interested in art.
8123,136,1,40,ESFP,23,<no>  I don't think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. The reason is that I think both emotion and reason are necessary.
8124,136,1,40,ESFP,24,<no>  You don't want to finish your chores first before going to bed. The reason is because I think you should take a break when you need it.
8125,136,1,40,ESFP,25,<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that even watching an argument can be stressful.
8126,136,1,40,ESFP,26,<no>  I'm not the type to avoid attracting other people's attention. The reason is that sometimes it's fun to be in the spotlight.
8127,136,1,40,ESFP,27,<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. I always try to do mind control.
8128,136,1,40,ESFP,28,"<<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who aren't as effective as I am. I get annoyed sometimes, but I don't express it."
8129,136,1,40,ESFP,29,<<Yes>  We often put things off until the very end. There was a time like that recently too.
8130,136,1,40,ESFP,30,<no>  I think the question of the afterlife is uninteresting. The reason is because I think the present is important.
8131,136,1,40,ESFP,31,<Yes>  I prefer to spend time with others rather than alone. Because I like to be with people rather than alone. So it is today.
8132,136,1,40,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I find principled stories boring. It's more fun when you tell other funny stories."
8133,136,1,40,ESFP,33,<Yes>  can easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds than mine. Because it is easy to understand other people's minds.
8134,136,1,40,ESFP,34,<Yes>  I tend to put off making decisions until the last minute. I postpone the decision as much as possible so as not to regret it.
8135,136,1,40,ESFP,35,<Yes>  I tend not to reconsider decisions I have already made. It's because thinking a lot doesn't change the result.
8136,136,1,40,ESFP,36,"<Yes>  Rather than spending time alone, I tend to relieve the fatigue of the week with fun parties and events. But these days I can't do that, so I'm a little bored."
8137,136,1,40,ESFP,37,<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. Because I'm not very interested in art.
8138,136,1,40,ESFP,38,"<no>  I don't often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. When you listen to the story, you understand and empathize."
8139,136,1,40,ESFP,39,<no>  I don't like to plan my daily to-dos. I tend to be spontaneous and plan only when there is important work to do.
8140,136,1,40,ESFP,40,<Yes>  I rarely feel insecure. It seems to be an innate tendency.
8141,136,1,40,ESFP,41,<Yes>  I would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. Having a face-to-face conversation with someone you don't know is a bit daunting.
8142,136,1,40,ESFP,42,<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. Because we know that everyone has different opinions.
8143,136,1,40,ESFP,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends to meet up first. If you want to see it, please contact me first."
8144,136,1,40,ESFP,44,"<no> If my plan is disrupted, I don't try to get back to it as quickly as possible. If plans get disrupted, look for other alternatives to get back on track."
8145,136,1,40,ESFP,45,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I regret my old mistakes. These days, I regret not having studied more."
8146,136,1,40,ESFP,46,<<Yes>  I tend not to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. I don't think so.
8147,136,1,40,ESFP,47,"<no> Rather than controlling my emotions, I tend not to be swayed by them. You know how to control your emotions, practice them, and control them."
8148,136,1,40,ESFP,48,<no>  I do not try to save the other person's face even when it is clear that it is their fault. Make the other person admit they were wrong.
8161,137,0,40,INTJ,1,"<no>  don't deliberately try to make new friends. I want to have my own time rather than spending uncomfortable time trying to make new friends. However, if he fits well with me and doesn't have any objection to me, I'll gladly try to be friends with him."
8162,137,0,40,INTJ,2,"<Yes> For me, rather than exploring various interests, I think finding new interests and focusing on them is more appropriate. My interest in work these days is to apply the motion graphics program I am using to other fields that I have in mind."
8163,137,0,40,INTJ,3,"<neutrality>  There are times when I want to cry when I see someone else crying, but not always. If you feel sincerity in the crying, there are times when you feel pity and want to cry, but if you feel fake, you won't feel the slightest sympathy."
8164,137,0,40,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  For every situation I can foresee, I tend to come up with countermeasures first and then go into action. It's because I don't like embarrassing situations that I'll face without a plan and I'm uncomfortable. But if you plan ahead, you can respond appropriately and feel comfortable."
8165,137,0,40,INTJ,5,"<no>  can't keep my composure in high pressure situations. Most of what I went through was pressure for the sake of pressure, and in that case, I didn't like people doing that, and I hated having to be in that situation."
8166,137,0,40,INTJ,6,"<neutrality>  It depends on what party or event it is and who you are. I hate uncomfortable situations, so I don't bother looking for new people, but if I feel sorry for them or learn something, I will approach them first."
8167,137,0,40,INTJ,7,"<Yes>  When I finish one thing, I tend to start another. If you are working on a project to mow the yard lawn and it rains, mow the lawn and go home and start the room cleaning project."
8168,137,0,40,INTJ,8,"<neutrality>  have a sentimental side, but I'm not immersed in sentimentality. Sometimes I look at objects such as streams or leaves, but depending on the situation, I am far from sentimental enough to be called cold-hearted."
8169,137,0,40,INTJ,9,"<no>  don't enjoy planning with a schedule or list per se. I don't like having to move on time, so I don't use diaries or other electronic tools for making lists or planning unless I need to take notes or make detailed notes at exact times."
8170,137,0,40,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  Even small mistakes make me feel down and doubt my ability or knowledge. There was a mistake while working on it recently, and I felt depressed thinking 'I'm only good at this'."
8171,137,0,40,INTJ,11,"<no>  It's not difficult for me to start a conversation with someone I don't know. If a person wants to talk to animals or plants, it wouldn't be strange to want to talk to people. But I don't start a conversation with someone who isn't human."
8172,137,0,40,INTJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in discussing works of art per se. This is because I believe that interpretation of a work of art is just interpretation, and that there is no right or best answer in the first place. However, I think that various interpretations are positive in terms of diversifying perspectives rather than forcing one interpretation."
8173,137,0,40,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason when emotions and reason are in conflict. Because in such a situation, there is only hatred and frustration in emotions, and there is a solution in reason."
8174,137,0,40,INTJ,14,"<neutrality>  prefer to plan the big picture of my schedule for the day, but I don¡¯t like having to set a detailed time and move exactly when the time is right. It's hard to breathe because I'm too tight on time and doing what I'm doing. So no matter where I plan to go, I want to see flowers and birds along the way."
8175,137,0,40,INTJ,15,"<no>  don't care how others see me. Unless I harm others, I don't want to worry about things and live an uncomfortable life, so no matter how others see me, I prefer to be comfortable with myself."
8176,137,0,40,INTJ,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy participating in group activities. Rather than the hustle and bustle and pretense of being in a group, I like leisure and time when I am alone."
8177,137,0,40,INTJ,17,<Yes>  I like books or movies that I can interpret in my own way. I prefer books and movies that make me think because they make me feel like me.
8178,137,0,40,INTJ,18,"<no> You don't always find greater satisfaction in helping others succeed. If someone is worthy of success, I'm willing to help them, but usually I don't care if they succeed or fail because I'm left behind."
8179,137,0,40,INTJ,19,"<no>  I have a lot of interests, but I tend to prioritize them according to my circumstances and needs, so I don't know what to do next. Currently, I am interested in travel and graphics... but considering my current circumstances, the order is set to graphics and travel."
8180,137,0,40,INTJ,20,"<neutrality>  I was often worried that things might go wrong, but this part is slowly changing. In hindsight, most worries don't prevent things from going wrong, and worries are just worries."
8181,137,0,40,INTJ,21,"<Yes>  I hate belonging to a group and I hate being a leader. I don't think I'm qualified to be the leader of a group, and I like quiet rather than noisy."
8182,137,0,40,INTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I tend to enjoy art, but I think I lack artistic inclination as a writer. When I look at a work of art, I see its value even if I don't intend it, but I feel difficulty in making a work of art."
8183,137,0,40,INTJ,23,"<neutrality>  tend to value rationality more than emotions, but I don't think that rationality alone would have made the world a better place. Emotion and rationality do not have to be chosen, because they complement each other."
8184,137,0,40,INTJ,24,"<Yes>  I tend to try to finish work before taking a break. It's not comfortable to take a break if you haven't finished your work, and you keep thinking about what's left."
8185,137,0,40,INTJ,25,"<neutrality>  It depends on what the subject of the debate is and whether you participate neutrally. It will be enjoyable if the subject matter of the debate is meaningful and the participants are neutral and candid without pretense. However, if you talk about meaningless topics or biased and obvious things, you will be offended and annoyed."
8186,137,0,40,INTJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't want to attract people's attention and if I have to be in the crowd, I just want to be quiet in the crowd. The reason is that I don't want to spend energy on things that aren't important to me, and I like the relaxation and relaxation that I can only feel when I'm alone."
8187,137,0,40,INTJ,27,"<Yes> It wasn't like that before, but looking at it recently, my emotions often change quickly. When I wake up in the morning, I feel frustrated for no reason, but at some point I feel relieved, and then I feel frustrated again."
8188,137,0,40,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  don't get annoyed with being inefficient, but I get annoyed with not having the heart to improve and just trying to get my hair done. In the past, there was an employee A who worked diligently and an employee B who was eager to show off that he was working rather than working itself. I didn't even like the sound of breathing."
8189,137,0,40,INTJ,29,"<no>  I'm not the type to procrastinate what I need to do now. If I put off what I have to do, it doesn¡¯t feel like I can rest even if I take a break, so even recently, if I can, I tend to take care of what I have to do."
8190,137,0,40,INTJ,30,"<neutrality>  I think the question of the afterlife is a bit interesting because everyone dies someday. But no one knows the answer to that question, so unless it's something like 'I think' or 'I want', I'll just live in the present and experience the afterlife after death."
8191,137,0,40,INTJ,31,"<no>  Unless you're close with family or close friends, you'd rather spend time alone than with other people. If I spend it with other people, there are many cases where I have to spend energy on things that are meaningless to me, so I'd rather spend time quietly by myself."
8192,137,0,40,INTJ,32,"<Yes>  am not interested in theory-based discussions and find them boring. I think the original theory is like the root of a tree, but I don't think a root without a stem is meaningless, so I'm not very interested in theory-based discussions."
8193,137,0,40,INTJ,33,"<neutrality>  I can sympathize with people from completely different backgrounds in some ways. For example, they probably have someone they love, and they can relate to that. And even if it's something I haven't experienced, if it's a pure and unfeigned emotion, I sympathize."
8194,137,0,40,INTJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone making decisions until the end. Until I make a decision, I try to consider my circumstances and the situations that may arise later as much as possible."
8195,137,0,40,INTJ,35,"<Yes>  Once I make a decision, I don't think about it again. When I make a decision, I think about it as much as possible until the end, and I don't think about a decision I've already made because I don't think it's meaningful to overturn it."
8196,137,0,40,INTJ,36,"<no>  Rather than participating in parties and events, I relieve fatigue through quiet time alone. Even these days, I like to spend time alone, and participating in parties and events doesn't feel like I'm getting tired and resting."
8197,137,0,40,INTJ,37,"<neutrality>  don't like all works of art, but there are some that I personally prefer. I have the idea that art should be creative, so I like creative works, and if not creative, at least the works should make me think."
8198,137,0,40,INTJ,38,"<neutrality>  There are times when I have a hard time understanding other people's feelings, and there are times when I naturally empathize without trying. For example, it's hard to understand that the person who cheated on you is rather angry, and you can naturally sympathize with someone you love who is having a hard time because they are sick."
8199,137,0,40,INTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my to-dos every day, but I don't like to plan too detailed and hourly. I don't like to be too bound by time, whether it's for work or personal things, and I like to set big things to do every day and do them step by step."
8200,137,0,40,INTJ,40,"<no> There are times when I feel insecure, not at all, but sometimes. I don't know if it's because of my innate tendency, but sometimes I suddenly feel insecure for no reason, but in those cases, something happens and I'm careful."
8201,137,0,40,INTJ,41,"<Yes>  I want to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. I'm not against talking on the phone, but unless I'm a close friend or family member, I prefer text messages or emails rather than phone calls because they feel more relaxed."
8202,137,0,40,INTJ,42,"<neutrality>  I try to understand opinions that are very different from mine, but that's not always the case. I almost got into an argument with a neighbor over parking in front of my house. The road in front of my house is not my land, so I can't say anything about parking, but I know that it shouldn't interfere with my house's traffic. Because of that problem, I thought 'why did that happen' for a while."
8203,137,0,40,INTJ,43,"<neutrality>  The contact with a friend to meet up varies a little from time to time, but on average it is half and half. Being a friend itself gives me something to gain, so sometimes I try to maintain a relationship with a friend."
8204,137,0,40,INTJ,44,"<no>  don't try to go right back to the plan just because there's a setback. Once I try to find a solution in that situation, I think I can go back to the plan if it is judged that there is no way."
8205,137,0,40,INTJ,45,"<no>  I feel embarrassed when I realize I made a mistake, but I don't regret it until after a long time has passed. I am not bound by the past because nothing will change even if I regret it now."
8206,137,0,40,INTJ,46,"<Yes>  Sometimes I think about why, but I don't think deeply. I think the existence itself is the reason, and since I can't figure out the correct answer just thinking about it, I want to spend the time I spend thinking about it on something more valuable."
8207,137,0,40,INTJ,47,"<neutrality>  usually control my emotions, but sometimes I can't control my emotions. When I'm swayed by my emotions, I sometimes hear from acquaintances saying, ""Why are you acting like you're not like you?"""
8208,137,0,40,INTJ,48,"<no>  When the other person's fault is obvious, I don't try to save the other person's face. I'm not trying to save face by just being honest or just letting it go. I don't even want to do it because I think it's just a pretense at that time."
8221,138,0,40,ISFP,1,"<no>  It's hard to form new relationships to make new friends, but more than anything, it's annoying."
8222,138,0,40,ISFP,2,"<Yes>  I have hobbies in various fields, but I am mostly interested in hobbies that I can do at home alone. These days, I'm interested in building Legos."
8223,138,0,40,ISFP,3,"<no> Just seeing someone else crying doesn't make you want to cry. When the situation overlaps with me or I understand it, I want to cry, but when it doesn't, I think about how to comfort myself so that I simply don't cry."
8224,138,0,40,ISFP,4,<neutrality>  It doesn't make many preparations. I usually think of one more fallback. It's because you're anxious if you don't have any preparedness.
8225,138,0,40,ISFP,5,"<Yes> In general, I tend to keep my composure. It was the first day of a new lecture recently, and I tried to control my mind to keep my composure."
8226,138,0,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  Rather than introducing myself to new people, I tend to get introduced by talking to people I already know. Because it's stressful to go ahead and introduce someone new."
8227,138,0,40,ISFP,7,"<Yes> In a situation where I have to prepare for several lectures at the same time, I tend to prepare for another lecture after completing one completely."
8228,138,0,40,ISFP,8,<no>  I don't think it's sentimental. This is because I have lived for over 40 years and have rarely shed tears while watching movies or dramas.
8229,138,0,40,ISFP,9,"<no> You don't seem to like making plans with schedules or lists. The reason is that I have to make a plan from time to time, think about it and put it into action, but I couldn't continue to execute it continuously."
8230,138,0,40,ISFP,10,"<no>  I make mistakes during my first lecture, but I don't care much because I tend to think of small mistakes as the process of becoming perfect."
8231,138,0,40,ISFP,11,"<no> Even if you are interested, it is not easy to approach and start a conversation first. Most of the time, I would start a conversation after getting to know other people around me."
8232,138,0,40,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  First of all, I'm not very interested in discussing things. I acknowledge that different people have different ideas, but I know that they won't convince me or change my opinion."
8233,138,0,40,ISFP,13,<Yes>  tend to try to follow reason rather than emotion. It's because there were many times when I did things based on my feelings and regretted them later.
8234,138,0,40,ISFP,14,<neutrality>  I tend to plan only what I absolutely have to do during the day and improvise what I want to do the rest of the day.
8235,138,0,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  I tend to worry about how others see me. When choosing clothes, I tend to wear things that look good to other people rather than clothes that I feel comfortable wearing."
8236,138,0,40,ISFP,16,<no>  I don't enjoy working in groups. I enjoy the work I do alone and it is comfortable for me.
8237,138,0,40,ISFP,17,"<no>  Rather than books and movies with open endings, I tend to like books and movies that have a clear ending because the ending is set. I like movies with clear endings like the recently watched Crime City 2."
8238,138,0,40,ISFP,18,<Yes> This is because there is greater satisfaction in helping others succeed and seeing them achieve it than in enduring the pressure to succeed.
8239,138,0,40,ISFP,19,"<Yes>  I have many hobbies, but since the time I can do is limited, I spend a lot of time choosing what to do in my free time."
8240,138,0,40,ISFP,20,"<no>  I don't often worry about things going wrong. Even if you worry, it's because it's already out of my hands, so it doesn't get better."
8241,138,0,40,ISFP,21,<Yes>  It's because you're uncomfortable with the pressure of taking on a leadership role and enduring the spotlight.
8242,138,0,40,ISFP,22,"<neutrality>  I don't think I have strong artistic inclinations, but I also don't think I have any. This is because, as a child, I enjoyed doing hand-made works such as printmaking."
8243,138,0,40,ISFP,23,"<neutrality>  think it depends on the standards of a better world. There may be scientific development, but I think that there will be problems such as respect for life."
8244,138,0,40,ISFP,24,"<neutrality>  It depends on the condition of the day. On days when I am very tired, I want to take a break and finish my chores, whereas in general, I want to finish my chores and rest."
8245,138,0,40,ISFP,25,"<Yes> It's because looking at other people's arguments, you can see that other people think differently about the same problem."
8246,138,0,40,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  I don't like to be noticed by others. This is because when other people's attention is focused on it, it is easy to get nervous and not be able to think smoothly."
8247,138,0,40,ISFP,27,<no>  I don't think that emotions change quickly. This is because the feelings of that morning often carry over into the evening.
8248,138,0,40,ISFP,28,"<no>  There are many frustrating parts when teaching my children, but I think that each person's position and speed are different."
8249,138,0,40,ISFP,29,"<Yes>  I usually put things off until the end. I don't just put it off because I don't want to do it, but I keep thinking back in my head and bring it out at the end to create results."
8250,138,0,40,ISFP,30,"<no>  I am a Christian. Therefore, regarding the afterlife, regardless of inclination, it is a matter of faith, not a matter of curiosity or interest."
8251,138,0,40,ISFP,31,<no>  I tend to prefer spending time alone rather than spending time with other people.
8252,138,0,40,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  I think theory-centered discussions are boring, and empirically, I tend to not be able to focus on the original story."
8253,138,0,40,ISFP,33,"<no>  Basically, I don't think of myself as someone who can easily empathize with others. But it's not easier to empathize with someone from a completely different background."
8254,138,0,40,ISFP,34,"<no>  If I have to make a decision anyway, I tend to make it quickly and prepare for the next one."
8255,138,0,40,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  tend not to rethink decisions I have already made. Because you've already made a decision, and even thinking about it again won't change anything."
8256,138,0,40,ISFP,36,<no>  I tend to have time alone to relieve the fatigue of the week. Because parties and events add more fatigue.
8257,138,0,40,ISFP,37,"<no>  It's not just art galleries, I'm not the type to enjoy appreciating works of art."
8258,138,0,40,ISFP,38,"<neutrality> It's not hard to understand other people's feelings, but even if you understand other people's feelings, you don't empathize."
8259,138,0,40,ISFP,39,"<no>  Rather than planning what to do every day, I tend to enjoy impulsively doing things for the day if I don't have important things to do."
8260,138,0,40,ISFP,40,<Yes>  I usually don't feel anxious. I tend to think positively.
8261,138,0,40,ISFP,41,"<Yes> Even if I do call, I'm the type to simply talk about business, because I have to force myself to say things that don't have to be difficult to end the call."
8262,138,0,40,ISFP,42,<no>  Because I don't think it will make sense in the end no matter how much time you spend on opinions that are very different from mine.
8263,138,0,40,ISFP,43,<no>  I don't usually make an appointment with a friend to meet first. Because I prefer to spend time alone rather than spending time with others.
8264,138,0,40,ISFP,44,"<Yes>  While giving a lecture, there are times when the lecture doesn't go as planned due to questions or other people's circumstances. In that case, I try to return to the original tempo as soon as possible."
8265,138,0,40,ISFP,45,"<no>  I don't tend to bring up old mistakes and think about them, so I don't have many regrets over my old mistakes."
8266,138,0,40,ISFP,46,"<no> As a devout Christian, I have a clear understanding of the reason for human existence and life."
8267,138,0,40,ISFP,47,<no>  My thoughts and other people's evaluations are the same. I tend to control my emotions rather than being swayed by them.
8268,138,0,40,ISFP,48,"<Yes>  If the other person's fault is obvious, the other person must be feeling it, but if you keep pushing it, problems can arise."
8281,139,0,40,ISFJ,1,<neutrality>  don't make any special efforts to make new friends outside of business-necessary relationships.
8282,139,0,40,ISFJ,2,<no>  I do not explore various interests in my free time. I spend most of my time watching YouTube or vlogs.
8283,139,0,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  If someone else is crying or watching a video like that, I too will cry and want to cry. It's sad because a consensus is formed depending on the situation."
8284,139,0,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  When I deal with work, I make 2-3 contingency plans. This is because they often panic when things go wrong without any preparation."
8285,139,0,40,ISFJ,5,"<neutrality>  I tend to keep my composure, but when the pressure is high, I can get confused or panic."
8286,139,0,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes> When I attend a party or event, I usually find people I know and talk to. Because I am shy, I find it difficult to meet new people."
8287,139,0,40,ISFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I tend to finish projects first when I'm free, but when I'm under pressure, I tend to do multiple projects together and be disorganized."
8288,139,0,40,ISFJ,8,<neutrality>  often think or appreciate while walking on the road or looking at the sunny sky outdoors. But I tend to make a mental commitment not to be too sentimental.
8289,139,0,40,ISFJ,9,<Yes>  I like to make plans by typing my schedule into my smartphone. Because you can organize the things you need to plan.
8290,139,0,40,ISFJ,10,<Yes>  Even small mistakes make me feel ashamed. I blame myself for why I made that mistake.
8291,139,0,40,ISFJ,11,"<no>  I find it difficult to talk to people even if I am interested in them. I'm interested and hang around, but it takes a lot of time to get close to talk."
8292,139,0,40,ISFJ,12,"<Yes>  I don't really care about art, so I think it's a waste of time to discuss it."
8293,139,0,40,ISFJ,13,"<neutrality>  prefer to follow reason rather than emotion. I try to change my mind emotionally, but I try to make a decision mainly by changing my mind rationally. However, there are times when people around me say that I am on the emotional side."
8294,139,0,40,ISFJ,14,<no>  I mainly like to plan and move. It's because I don't like to be confused because I don't know what to do when I start to improvise.
8295,139,0,40,ISFJ,15,<no>  tend to be very conscious of my surroundings. It's because you don't like being criticized or seen as odd by others.
8296,139,0,40,ISFJ,16,"<no>  I don't like group activities. Unless I have to do group activities because of my company life, I prefer to do activities alone or in small groups."
8297,139,0,40,ISFJ,17,"<neutrality>  I like movies with a fixed ending, but sometimes open endings are also novel, so I watch them occasionally. I was very impressed with Alien Covenant."
8298,139,0,40,ISFJ,18,<Yes>  I find satisfaction in helping. Helping me succeed as a helper is because I can realize that my value is that high.
8299,139,0,40,ISFJ,19,"<no>  I have little interest. So, after finishing the job I am interested in, I tend to find and research the next job I am interested in."
8300,139,0,40,ISFJ,20,"<neutrality> I'm not the type to worry often. Usually, I try to work comfortably with the mindset that it will work somehow, but when it comes to big projects or important things, I worry about whether I can finish the job well."
8301,139,0,40,ISFJ,21,<Yes>  I try to avoid the role of leader. It is because there is a heart that does not want to harm the organization members because of the burden of responsibility and doubts about the qualifications as a leader.
8302,139,0,40,ISFJ,22,<Yes>  don't think I have artistic inclinations. It's because I don't think I have the sense and creativity that artists have.
8303,139,0,40,ISFJ,23,<neutrality>  I believe that the world would be a better place if reason and emotion coexisted. It's because I think it's dangerous when I'm leaning to either side.
8304,139,0,40,ISFJ,24,<Yes>  I want to finish my chores and take a break. It's because I think it's right to take a break after completing a given task.
8305,139,0,40,ISFJ,25,<no>  I don't like to watch the controversy. It's because I think meaningless arguments are exhausting.
8306,139,0,40,ISFJ,26,<Yes>  I try not to attract other people's attention. Because they don't like to be noticed by anything.
8307,139,0,40,ISFJ,27,<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. Because you don't want to affect those around you with your sudden change of emotions.
8308,139,0,40,ISFJ,28,<Yes>  I sometimes get annoyed when I see people who aren't efficient. I get annoyed because there are people who don't listen to advice because they don't know well and work in a rough-and-tumble manner.
8309,139,0,40,ISFJ,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to prioritize what needs to be done, but I tend to procrastinate as much as possible when things are fearful of consequences or unlikely to work out."
8310,139,0,40,ISFJ,30,"<Yes>  I think about the afterlife. Because there is hope for heaven, there are many worries about how to live the present life."
8311,139,0,40,ISFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. It's because even if you spend time alone, you want to spend time with other people when the schedule fits. It doesn't get very entangled."
8312,139,0,40,ISFJ,32,"<Yes> I'm not really interested in discussion. This is because they want to participate in discussions where results can be drawn immediately, but in principle, they hate boring discussions and meetings."
8313,139,0,40,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I can't easily empathize with other people's backgrounds, but I try to empathize. It's because I think that empathy must precede in order to have a conversation and that it can melt into a conversation through that."
8314,139,0,40,ISFJ,34,<no>  I try to make decisions quickly. This is because it increases work efficiency.
8315,139,0,40,ISFJ,35,"<Yes>  I tend not to reconsider decisions. Because if you think about it, nothing will change."
8316,139,0,40,ISFJ,36,<no>  I prefer to spend time alone. This is because they think that parties and events consume more energy.
8317,139,0,40,ISFJ,37,<no>  I don't like art galleries. It seems that fatigue builds up more because of the low level of understanding of art works.
8318,139,0,40,ISFJ,38,"<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. Since I participate in the conversation with the thought that everyone can do that, I tend to understand and empathize with the emotions in the conversation itself."
8319,139,0,40,ISFJ,39,<Yes>  I like to plan things to do. It's because I think that working according to the plan will increase efficiency and be efficient.
8320,139,0,40,ISFJ,40,<Yes>  don't feel very anxious. It seems to be because of the tendency that has been passed on since the laid-back grandfather.
8321,139,0,40,ISFJ,41,<Yes>  I tend to avoid phone calls. This is because there are times when the message heard over the receiver is sometimes missed due to poor hearing.
8322,139,0,40,ISFJ,42,"<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand other opinions. I think it's a waste of time to spend a lot of time, so I'm going to admit it and move on."
8323,139,0,40,ISFJ,43,<no>  I'm not the first to contact you. That's why I feel sad that my friends don't contact me often and that I'm indifferent.
8324,139,0,40,ISFJ,44,"<Yes>  I try to work according to plan. If there is a setback in my plan, I tend to get stressed out, so I try to find out what went wrong and finish it as planned."
8325,139,0,40,ISFJ,45,"<Yes>  often regret my mistakes. When I think of the mistakes I made in my words, I blame myself for what I did."
8326,139,0,40,ISFJ,46,"<no>  I don't think deeply about human beings and their reasons for living. I don't think it's very meaningful, so I tend to understand and grasp the meaning through books and information."
8327,139,0,40,ISFJ,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions. Of course, there are times when he is swung around, but I hear stories that he reassures those around him by controlling his emotions."
8328,139,0,40,ISFJ,48,<Yes>  I tend to try to save the face of the other person. It's because I think it's right to tell and encourage the wrong part in a quiet place after saving face rather than reprimand in a public place.
8341,140,1,40,ISFP,1,<no>  I don't make friends every once in a while. The reason is that meeting new people and getting to know them takes a lot of time and energy and feels very exhausting.
8342,140,1,40,ISFP,2,<neutrality>  I crave free time very much and want to have some alone time. The reason is that he likes to experience various things through YouTube and just wants to be alone in his free time.
8343,140,1,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  have great empathy with others. We tend to cry together when we hear of other people's hardships, when others cry, or when there is a sad scene in a drama. In a way, I think it's a serious thing."
8344,140,1,40,ISFP,4,"<neutrality>  I think a lot and think a lot to solve the problem. On the other hand, I also have the mindset that something will work out. The reason is that if you have to take responsibility, you tend to prepare a lot of countermeasures, but in normal times, it's a big hassle."
8345,140,1,40,ISFP,5,"<no>  I hate mentally exhausting situations. I rather prefer physical fatigue and hate mentally difficult places, because I am vulnerable to stress. I've been having a hard time lately with emotional instructions from my boss at work."
8346,140,1,40,ISFP,6,"<neutrality> In normal situations, I tend to talk to someone I know first, but in a place where there are many people I don't know, I tend to talk to someone who has a similar disposition to me. The reason is because the person you know is comfortable."
8347,140,1,40,ISFP,7,"<Yes>  I often write proposals in companies. The reason is that a lot of information must be collected and a lot of data analyzed, such as the cause and reason, when doing one project, but it takes time and concentration. It is also because I want to do even one thing perfectly."
8348,140,1,40,ISFP,8,"<Yes>  I tend to focus more on emotion than reason. The reason is that, for example, when a colleague did not do a perfect job and the situation to handle the work was very poor than the person's ability, it is easy to accept and understand."
8349,140,1,40,ISFP,9,"<no>  hate making plans when there is an event. The reason is that the time and schedule for the plan are always wrong and the schedule is not right, so I tend to set a rough guideline and deal with it according to the situation."
8350,140,1,40,ISFP,10,"<Yes>  tend to feel a lot while working lately. The reason is that the new computer technology or document writing method lags behind that of young people, and whenever I make mistakes, I doubt my skills or abilities and become discouraged. For example, there have been times when I was instructed to put food in the refrigerator before it spoiled, but when I was concentrating on other things, I forgot to put it in the fridge and ended up spoiling the food. I get very depressed when my boss points it out and I tend to blame myself for my mistakes."
8351,140,1,40,ISFP,11,"<no> When I meet someone new that I'm interested in, it's hard to approach and talk to them first. The reason is because I don't know how that person evaluates me. For example, when I go to a new meeting or meeting, I tend to start a conversation when someone asks me a question, even if it's trivial."
8352,140,1,40,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in art and I don't like having discussions with others. The reason is that there are individual differences in each point of view, but I don't think my thoughts are exactly right."
8353,140,1,40,ISFP,13,"<Yes>  I have to handle things rationally, but it is often emotional. For example, when a colleague makes a mistake, I have to point out the wrong thing with a rational judgment, but I often process it emotionally because I think my colleague might not like my personal friendship or my intellectual quality, and my boss also tells me that my junior colleague is wrong objectively. I pointed out how to handle it well without pointing it out."
8354,140,1,40,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  It doesn't work in a planned way. Usually, when the date to submit work approaches, I tend to stay up all night, and on days when there are no major incidents, I work almost freely."
8355,140,1,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  am very sensitive to the opinions of others. For example, is it an evaluation of me if someone is talking to me? You will pay a lot of attention. No matter how hard I try to think that not everyone likes me, it's not easy. The reason is because I have a Cinderella complex."
8356,140,1,40,ISFP,16,"<neutrality>  I like activities that guarantee anonymity in groups. For example, you like group training, but dislike individual presentations in group activities."
8357,140,1,40,ISFP,17,"<Yes>  I usually like movies or novels with endings. This is because, if the end is not clear, the ending cannot be known, so I have to imagine various things and feel a more stuffy thirst. In The Witch 2, Da-mi Kim did not appear, so my curiosity exploded."
8358,140,1,40,ISFP,18,"<no> First of all, my success is fundamental and I love helping others. I'm tired of life and I don't want to help others in situations where I'm worse off than others and wish others success."
8359,140,1,40,ISFP,19,"<no>  I'm obsessed with my job or area of interest for a period of time, so I'm not curious about anything else. Recently, I am interested in the news of Son Heung-min, so I listen to a lot of news about soccer. I tend to only be interested in one thing."
8360,140,1,40,ISFP,20,"<Yes>  I often worry when I have to make a choice or wait for a decision. There is no particular reason, but I did my best, but I think it was because I thought that someone else could do better than me."
8361,140,1,40,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  don't want to be in charge. Most of the time, I've done a lot of responsibility, but in the end, I have to take responsibility for all the mistakes of my subordinates and team members, and I have to listen to others."
8362,140,1,40,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  When it comes to artistic inclination, I think that creativity and imagination must be developed. I have to think differently than others, but I have a stereotypical FM mindset and hate anything that stands out in particular."
8363,140,1,40,ISFP,23,"<no>  If everyone lives only with rational people, they think there is no humanity. Humans can make mistakes, and they can help. What makes them different from machines is that they can understand and empathize with others. That's why I think art has developed."
8364,140,1,40,ISFP,24,"<Yes> When I'm tired at home and want to rest, I want to finish cleaning or washing dishes and rest comfortably. The reason is that you can't rest completely comfortably because you think about things that have been pushed while taking a break."
8365,140,1,40,ISFP,25,"<no>  I like a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. In the simple intellectual part of a conversation with others, even if others give the wrong answer, I will teach you the correct answer only a few times. I think it's up to others not to change my mind even after that, and I hate fighting accents and emotional expressions during discussions."
8366,140,1,40,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  I hate receiving attention from others. In the process of presenting group assignments, I mainly like to be in charge of data research, but I don't like to present in front of everyone."
8367,140,1,40,ISFP,27,"<Yes>  I think emotions change very quickly. I get very annoyed when something doesn't go the way I thought it would. However, there are times when eating something delicious at that time makes you feel better right away."
8368,140,1,40,ISFP,28,"<neutrality>  It doesn't matter if it doesn't hurt me too much. But I get very angry when things I've instructed aren't executed properly, when mistakes are made, when I'm taking a break and not doing what I'm supposed to do."
8369,140,1,40,ISFP,29,"<Yes> If there is something that needs to be done until the end of the day, I put it off as much as possible and rush to work when the schedule approaches. Even recently, if there is nothing special to do, I work slowly and comfortably, and at the end of the day, I rush to enter the settlement and work at night."
8370,140,1,40,ISFP,30,"<neutrality>  I don't think much of it. I think there are ghosts, and when I hear or see unbelievable stories related to ghosts, I get curious, but since I haven't actually seen them, I'm not curious except for a little bit of curiosity."
8371,140,1,40,ISFP,31,"<no>  I get tired easily when I have relationships with people. Social relationships are more demanding than physical work, so I prefer to spend time alone."
8372,140,1,40,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  I like stories that come from real experience rather than theory. No matter how good the theory is, it may be different in practice."
8373,140,1,40,ISFP,33,"<neutrality>  It's a situation I've never been through, so I think it may not be easy to empathize. However, since all people's lives seem to be the same, I think there will be some sympathy. I heard about a friend's experience at work, but my company doesn't tolerate that kind of thing, but that company tolerates it differently from our company, so there are parts that I don't understand."
8374,140,1,40,ISFP,34,"<Yes>  I put off making decisions until the end. When making a decision, I tend to consider both good and bad points and ask a lot of opinions from people around me and family."
8375,140,1,40,ISFP,35,"<no>  I've already made a decision, but I always regret it. It's not a decision with only disadvantages, but there are pros and cons, so you always have a little regret for not choosing."
8376,140,1,40,ISFP,36,"<no>  Try to spend time alone. There are many corona and virus infections, so we are trying to reduce the opportunity to meet people as much as possible. For example, if you want to watch a movie, you try to watch the latest movie on the Internet."
8377,140,1,40,ISFP,37,"<no>  I don't like the action of moving. They do not have much interest in viewing art galleries, works of art, or art activities. Rather, I prefer to watch it on TV at home."
8378,140,1,40,ISFP,38,"<no>  They are very sensitive to people's facial expressions and mood swings, and tend to observe their mood. If you notice that the faces of people who work as usual are different from usual, they will ask about their health first."
8379,140,1,40,ISFP,39,"<no>  You know what to do every day, but you don't keep it on time as planned. There are many cases in which we deal with personal or company affairs according to the situation of the day."
8380,140,1,40,ISFP,40,"<no>  I live with tension in almost every situation. It seems to be a tendency from birth, and since childhood, he has been more sensitive and worried than others."
8381,140,1,40,ISFP,41,"<Yes> Even when I have to make a phone call when I am chatting with a friend, I feel very tired and rarely do it. If it's not urgent, I like to text."
8382,140,1,40,ISFP,42,"<no> If there is an exact answer of 1 + 1 = 2, tell the other person that the answer is 2. However, if you insist on 3 to the end, say check it out again and do not claim any more. In every situation, to those who have a different opinion from me, I emphasize that I have this opinion, and I have the idea that even if they have a different opinion, they are different from me, so they can think that way, so I try to change their thoughts or opinions. don't"
8383,140,1,40,ISFP,43,"<no>  I tend to be very troublesome and like to roll around at home. That's why even if someone calls to meet, they are reluctant to meet separately."
8384,140,1,40,ISFP,44,"<Yes>  Suddenly, as Corona 19 spread among office workers, there was a shortage of manpower. The rest of the personnel even took on the part of the staff who went into quarantine. I did my best to keep up with my usual schedule."
8385,140,1,40,ISFP,45,"<Yes> There are times when I am very ashamed of the things I made in the past that suddenly come to mind. Sometimes, when I am driving or just blankly, I often think of a lot of mistakes I made in the past, so I blame myself."
8386,140,1,40,ISFP,46,"<Yes>  I don't ask many philosophical questions like human existence and what do I live for? Even thinking about it, it is difficult to find a clear answer. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't always find a clear answer. After graduating from high school, I stopped thinking about philosophical questions."
8387,140,1,40,ISFP,47,"<Yes>  The moment-to-moment change of emotions is severe. It seems to have gotten worse since going through menopause. When you suddenly see your boss's bad behavior, there are many times when you see your boss's unpleasant behavior, and there are often times when you express your feelings in a crooked way. People around me say that I look calm just by looking at them, but my feelings are not."
8388,140,1,40,ISFP,48,<Yes>  I don't like it when I point out my mistakes to others. The reason is that I feel very embarrassed and upset when others point out my mistakes. I just want that person to know his fault.
8401,141,1,20,ESTP,1,<no>  I don't make new friends regularly. I tend to naturally distance myself from my existing friends.
8402,141,1,20,ESTP,2,"<Yes> These days, I am very interested in my career path. I also had fun studying four weeks."
8403,141,1,20,ESTP,3,"<no>  When someone else cries, I think that there must be a reason why that person cries, so I don¡¯t really empathize."
8404,141,1,20,ESTP,4,<Yes>  yes. I felt more at ease when I set up a number of alternative plans in preparation for things not going well.
8405,141,1,20,ESTP,5,<Yes>  yes. I tend to keep my composure well because I think it will be okay if I just focus on what I have to do.
8406,141,1,20,ESTP,6,<Yes>  I tend to talk first with someone I already know. Because it's more comfortable that way.
8407,141,1,20,ESTP,7,"<no>  I¡¯m not the type to focus on just one thing, so I tend to do a little bit of several things at the same time."
8408,141,1,20,ESTP,8,"<no>  I used to get sentimental when I was younger, but after growing up, I don't tend to do that."
8409,141,1,20,ESTP,9,"<Yes>  I like to line up the things I have to do each day, and I feel proud when I keep them all."
8410,141,1,20,ESTP,10,"<no>  It was like that when I was young, but it doesn't feel like it after I thought that it would be okay if I learned the method."
8411,141,1,20,ESTP,11,"<no>  Most of them are on the difficult side, so I don't talk to them first. Even though I'm interested."
8412,141,1,20,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  I was very interested in it when I was young, but after I realized that no matter what I tried, my interest in it decreased."
8413,141,1,20,ESTP,13,<Yes>  I tend to think rationally and let emotions follow. People around you will think so too.
8414,141,1,20,ESTP,14,"<no>  I did that when I was younger, but I switched to planning to better design my life."
8415,141,1,20,ESTP,15,<no>  I tend to worry about what other people will think of me. But it's much less than before.
8416,141,1,20,ESTP,16,<no>  I am not very interested in group activities and prefer to be alone. It's more fun to read a book or play a game.
8417,141,1,20,ESTP,17,"<no>  tend to stop at enjoying movies, and I tend to read helpful books, so it's not that big of a deal."
8418,141,1,20,ESTP,18,"<no>  I feel greater satisfaction when I prioritize my success and achieve it. After I do well, I want to help others."
8419,141,1,20,ESTP,19,"<Yes>  There were so many things I wanted to do, so there were so many things I had to do in a day that I was at a loss."
8420,141,1,20,ESTP,20,"<no>  I used to worry a lot when I was younger, but I realized that it wouldn't help much, so I don't worry too often."
8421,141,1,20,ESTP,21,"<Yes>  I haven't played the role of a leader much, and I'm the type of person who doesn't want to do it because I don't think it'll be bothersome."
8422,141,1,20,ESTP,22,"<no>  I like drawing and crafting, so I think I have a lot of artistic inclinations."
8423,141,1,20,ESTP,23,<neutrality>  I don't think you need to think in such a binary way. I think the world will be a better place when emotional and rational people coexist.
8424,141,1,20,ESTP,24,"<no> When I get home, I tend to take a good rest first. That gave me the strength to do the rest of the work again."
8425,141,1,20,ESTP,25,<no>  I want to avoid fighting as much as possible. What's the use of arguing?
8426,141,1,20,ESTP,26,<Yes>  I don't think it's going to change much if you pay attention. I don't think there's anything to be gained by attracting attention.
8427,141,1,20,ESTP,27,"<neutrality>  I think the amplification of emotions comes and goes. One day I like someone, and then I hate it because of something in one day."
8428,141,1,20,ESTP,28,"<no>  I think that person is that person and I am me, so I am not particularly annoyed. I think it would be a loss if I consumed my emotions."
8429,141,1,20,ESTP,29,<Yes>  I tend to put off work until I meet the deadline. It was like that recently too.
8430,141,1,20,ESTP,30,"<Yes>  Human beings have their souls dwelling in their bodies, so I wonder where their souls will go when they die."
8431,141,1,20,ESTP,31,"<no> Even these days, ever since I was little, I've always preferred spending time alone."
8432,141,1,20,ESTP,32,"<no>  There are things to be learned from theory-based discussions, and I think that a good conclusion can be drawn only by digging into the original story."
8433,141,1,20,ESTP,33,"<neutrality>  There are times when it's hard to relate to people who are too different, but I think I'm the type to sympathize with them by using my imagination to some extent."
8434,141,1,20,ESTP,34,<neutrality>  think there are things to postpone decisions and there are things to choose right away without procrastinating. I think I mostly choose right away.
8435,141,1,20,ESTP,35,<Yes>  I don't think there's any need to think about the past again anyway. What has already passed has passed.
8436,141,1,20,ESTP,36,<no>  I value my time alone and spend time alone to relieve the fatigue of the week.
8437,141,1,20,ESTP,37,<no>  I am not very interested in going to art galleries. I don't think there's much to be gained from appreciating art.
8438,141,1,20,ESTP,38,"<neutrality>  There are hard times and easy times. I don't empathize with situations that are difficult to understand, and I empathize with situations that are easy."
8439,141,1,20,ESTP,39,"<Yes>  I want to achieve great things by doing little by little. So, I tend to plan what to do every day."
8440,141,1,20,ESTP,40,<no>  I tend to feel anxious when things don't go well. I think I'm a bit sensitive by nature.
8441,141,1,20,ESTP,41,<Yes>  want to do things through text that I don't have to do over the phone. It bothers me for nothing.
8442,141,1,20,ESTP,42,<no>  I don't want to try to understand other opinions than mine. I think it's better to just pretend that he's like that.
8443,141,1,20,ESTP,43,"<no>  I didn't ask my friend to meet first, so there were many times when we naturally drifted apart. I've been like that since I was little."
8444,141,1,20,ESTP,44,"<Yes> If there is a setback, I tend to make other plans and try to fix it. So I always have a plan b in mind."
8445,141,1,20,ESTP,45,"<Yes>  I don't look back at my mistakes from long ago, and I don't regret it. If you think about it, it's a waste of time. It was when I was young and it is now."
8446,141,1,20,ESTP,46,<Yes>  I think I need to know the reason for my existence and life so that I can know how to act in this world.
8447,141,1,20,ESTP,47,"<neutrality>  tend to get swayed by my emotions in big events, but I tend to work hard and try to find reason."
8448,141,1,20,ESTP,48,"<no>  If the other person's fault is obvious, I tend to take action by leaving the place. I don't care about face shape."
8461,142,0,40,ISFP,1,"<no>  It seems like spending energy to make new friends feels unnecessary, so I get along well with existing friends and don't try to make new friends."
8462,142,0,40,ISFP,2,"<Yes>  It is a job that requires a lot of free time for searching, so if I am curious or need something, I tend to search variously on the computer. These days, I'm interested in stocks, financial technology, sports, etc., so I'm looking for and studying every day."
8463,142,0,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  I often shed tears while watching touching videos on YouTube. If you feel empathy or feel the emotions of the person who is crying, you may feel more likely to cry together."
8464,142,0,40,ISFP,4,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I just give up with the thought that I don't know, and in the case of stocks or investment, there may be a loss, so I tend to make my own preparations."
8465,142,0,40,ISFP,5,"<neutrality>  Since I'm in business, I tend to put in an effort to smile and move on with most things. Not long ago, there was a case of a fight with a customer, but it doesn't seem like it's easy to keep your composure."
8466,142,0,40,ISFP,6,"<no>  In my 20s, when I went to a new place, I got along well with new people, but now that I'm older, I seem to be finding comfort. Maybe it's because I'm timid, so it's hard to communicate with new people. If I have to pick a reason, I think it's unnecessary, so I think I'm reluctant to meet new people."
8467,142,0,40,ISFP,7,"<Yes> When starting a job, I prefer to do several things one at a time rather than all at once. If you try to do several things at once, it doesn't work properly and it only seems to take more time, so I prefer to prioritize and do them one by one."
8468,142,0,40,ISFP,8,"<no>  I don't think I'm a person whose emotions change greatly. Whether it's good or sad, it doesn't seem to fall very deeply. It seems like living a quiet life."
8469,142,0,40,ISFP,9,"<no>  don't think I can make a plan and write it down in a diary. When I decide to go on vacation, I book only the lodging and then I go to the town and improvise the rest, so I don't like to make plans."
8470,142,0,40,ISFP,10,"<no>  Even if you make a mistake, do not blame yourself or resent it. If I accidentally miss someone, I think the next person will come and move on."
8471,142,0,40,ISFP,11,"<Yes>  I haven't had this kind of experience lately, but when I think back to the past, when I see a girl I'm interested in, I easily approach her, talk to her, and have a drink. If you're going to regret it anyway, let's talk about it."
8472,142,0,40,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  don't know much about art, and I don't think I can discuss things I don't know and pretend to be smart."
8473,142,0,40,ISFP,13,"<Yes>  Work rationally rather than emotionally. If you work with emotions, you will lose a lot and get a lot of stress. People around me say it's toxic, but I try to work rationally as much as possible."
8474,142,0,40,ISFP,14,"<Yes> It seems to work spontaneously. For example, if I want to rest, I just write it as a holiday, go somewhere to play, come back, and work the next day."
8475,142,0,40,ISFP,15,"<no>  I tend not to worry too much. After thinking that I need to look good even for those who hate me, I don't think I'm worried about how people around me will see me because no matter how I act, people who need me will remain around me, so I can relate to them."
8476,142,0,40,ISFP,16,"<no>  I don't remember participating in group activities, but I don't enjoy them either. People around me ask me to go with the firefighting corps, but since I don't have any intention of going there and hanging out, it seems that I don't enjoy participating."
8477,142,0,40,ISFP,17,"<no>  like that the ending is clearly defined. I like endings that come out the way the director or writer intended. Rather than having to use my head to interpret something new, it's neat to just stare at it blankly and come out when it's over. It's a sad feeling if there is no ending."
8478,142,0,40,ISFP,18,<no>  I think that others should do well. I don't think it makes sense to help others succeed when I have nothing to offer. It seems that I help others when I can afford it.
8479,142,0,40,ISFP,19,"<no>  There isn't much to be interested in. Rather than what to do, what to do and what to spend the time on is a concern. You never know what to do because you have a few interests."
8480,142,0,40,ISFP,20,"<no> I'm not worried in advance. If something goes wrong, it's better to fix it quickly. If worrying goes well, worry dozens of times. Worrying doesn't change anything, so I don't worry often."
8481,142,0,40,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  I tend to talk about unreasonable things as being unreasonable, but I don't take the lead. My work is also busy, but I don't bother to take care of my surroundings and represent myself."
8482,142,0,40,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  am not interested in art or music. I don't know much, and when an expensive painting comes out, I think it's very expensive, but I can't seem to figure out the value."
8483,142,0,40,ISFP,23,"<no>  I think it tilts if either side is biased. I think people who value emotions should go back together with people who value reason. The world is a place where various people live in various ways, and I don't think it will be a better world if there are many on my side."
8484,142,0,40,ISFP,24,"<no>  Even if the house is not organized, if I want to rest, I just rest. After taking a break, I tend to clean or do housework. It doesn't change anything if I don't clean up the mess right now, so I tend to clean it up when I want to."
8485,142,0,40,ISFP,25,"<Yes> 100 minutes discussion I enjoy this kind of broadcast. I love hearing different opinions from different people. Oh, you think like this. You have different thoughts from me, but you can think like that. I like this kind of feeling, so I like broadcasts that argue."
8486,142,0,40,ISFP,26,<Yes>  I think the age of wanting attention has passed. I hate to tire myself out by drawing attention. It seems that I just want to live comfortably as it flows.
8487,142,0,40,ISFP,27,"<no> No matter what others say, I seem to be good at maintaining my composure. I hate getting caught up in a fight around me. When I see a life without major quarrels, I don't think emotions change that quickly."
8488,142,0,40,ISFP,28,"<no>  If there are people who can't work, I tend to do them. Even if I get annoyed, I don't think that person will change, so if I tell them to and don't do it, I'll do it."
8489,142,0,40,ISFP,29,"<no> When something needs to be done, I do it right away. Then I do other things. If you don't do it and do something else, it will stay in your head and nothing else will work, so if you have something to do, do it right away."
8490,142,0,40,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  Since no one has ever been there, it is an imaginary world, so it is curious and interesting. These days, I like movies like The World After Death or The Unknown World because I can express my imagination well on the screen."
8491,142,0,40,ISFP,31,"<no>  like time alone. Because I do business, I have a lot of contact with people, so I like time alone in the store during the day."
8492,142,0,40,ISFP,32,"<no>  I like discussions, and I don't think it's boring because I may have to come up with a principled story to have a discussion. I don't try to find discussions on topics I'm not interested in, but I never thought it was boring to enjoy the discussion itself."
8493,142,0,40,ISFP,33,"<no>  People from completely different backgrounds can't relate to me because I've never experienced it. I can talk artificially, but I don't seem to be able to empathize and communicate."
8494,142,0,40,ISFP,34,"<no>  When I make a decision, I tend to do it right away. I bought a new car last month, and when I saw that I decided to buy a car and immediately signed a contract, it seems that the decision is implemented immediately."
8495,142,0,40,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  Once you make a decision, you don't think about it unless you change it again. It's a decision that I thought about a lot before making a decision, so thinking again doesn't change it, and even if it's a wrong decision, it's my decision, so I don't regret it."
8496,142,0,40,ISFP,36,<no>  I want to be alone and I want to spend time alone. I'm a natural person Seeing the healing while watching the pros seems to long for a life of one's own.
8497,142,0,40,ISFP,37,"<no>  Museum exhibition hall I like places like this. Art museums have different eyes, so I don't like them because I think I have to see these things."
8498,142,0,40,ISFP,38,"<no>  I never thought it was difficult because I had no intention of understanding other people's feelings. It's hard to get over thinking that this person is talking with these feelings, and there doesn't seem to be anything like this."
8499,142,0,40,ISFP,39,"<no>  I'm used to what I do every day, so I don't plan and do this. It's not like I'm doing it with a plan, so it seems like I'm just working."
8500,142,0,40,ISFP,40,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I feel insecure. When sales are low this month, when there is more money to go out than money to come in, I feel anxious and worried."
8501,142,0,40,ISFP,41,"<no> It sounds like you are on the phone often. I want to avoid this kind of thing, but I don't avoid it when I have to do something over the phone."
8502,142,0,40,ISFP,42,"<no>  I don't try to understand people who disagree with me. Understanding is like trying to convince that person of my opinion, so if you disagree with me, I'll move on. I don't bother trying to understand it because it seems like it's going to get emotional when I try to say it with a different opinion."
8503,142,0,40,ISFP,43,"<no>  I have fewer friends to meet, and even if I meet them, I don't have the fun of meeting them like I did in the past, so I don't seem to keep in touch. I think I like to play with my family more than with my friends."
8504,142,0,40,ISFP,44,"<Yes>  If something planned is canceled or setbacks, we do something similar. I was going to go glamping with my children, but I couldn't go to the place I wanted to go to, so I hurriedly found another place because I was afraid that the children would be disappointed."
8505,142,0,40,ISFP,45,"<no>  I try not to regret it because I think that what has already passed cannot be undone. I regret starting the business, but I'm trying not to get stressed out because I know there's no turning back."
8506,142,0,40,ISFP,46,<Yes>  I don't want to live thinking about the existence of a life that can last less than a hundred years at the most and the reason for living. I just want to live a healthy and enjoyable life until the day I die.
8507,142,0,40,ISFP,47,"<no>  I don't work because I'm swayed by emotions. I work rationally rather than emotionally, so I don't think I'm being swayed by my emotions."
8508,142,0,40,ISFP,48,"<no>  If the other person's fault is obvious, I tend to tell them about it. I think that I have to recognize that I am wrong so that I can not make that mistake next time, so I tend to talk about things that are wrong."
8521,143,1,30,ESFJ,1,"<Yes>  You could say I tend to make new friends first. However, we are taking our time and looking at people's tendencies to determine whether we should approach them."
8522,143,1,30,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  Recently, I have become interested in entrepreneurship. I recently saw YouTube and thought I wanted to try it, so I searched for the field through Naver."
8523,143,1,30,ESFJ,3,"<Yes> When I see someone else crying, I want to cry. I think the reason is because they are rich in sensitivity and have excellent empathy."
8524,143,1,30,ESFJ,4,<no>  I tend to regret later when things go wrong. The reason is because they have a challenging spirit and tend to do things first.
8525,143,1,30,ESFJ,5,"<Yes> Being an emotional person by nature, I felt insecure in a high-pressure environment. However, as the years pass, I tend to keep my composure well, knowing that this too will pass."
8526,143,1,30,ESFJ,6,"<no>  I am also comfortable talking to people I know mostly. However, I think it's important to approach new people first, so I'm actively introducing myself."
8527,143,1,30,ESFJ,7,<Yes>  like to finish the project I'm working on first. I think the reason is that doing various projects at the same time can lead to confusion and mistakes.
8528,143,1,30,ESFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I am often sentimental. But now, it is often judged rationally."
8529,143,1,30,ESFJ,9,<no>  I'm not very fond of planning. The reason is that you don't want to be stressed out when your specific plans go awry.
8530,143,1,30,ESFJ,10,"<no>  I do not question my ability or knowledge. Because I know the level, I tend to admit my mistakes as much as possible."
8531,143,1,30,ESFJ,11,"<Yes>  I am good at reaching out to others first. Most of them are happy with my behavior of greeting and showing interest in them first, and sometimes develop deep relationships."
8532,143,1,30,ESFJ,12,<no> I'm not interested in art. The reason is that living a real life feels daunting.
8533,143,1,30,ESFJ,13,"<Yes>  I am constantly striving to think rationally. It's because you think that even good things can go wrong when emotions take precedence. However, people around me think that I am an emotional person."
8534,143,1,30,ESFJ,14,"<neutrality>  prefer improvisation to planning. However, if I have work or an appointment, I tend to go according to plan first."
8535,143,1,30,ESFJ,15,"<Yes>  I used to worry about how others see me. However, there are only a few people who think badly of me, and since I thought that it would be enough if people who truly knew me remained by my side, I didn't worry."
8536,143,1,30,ESFJ,16,"<neutrality>  like to hang out with people. However, I enjoy it when it comes to group activities, but until then I find it annoying."
8537,143,1,30,ESFJ,17,"<no>  Actually, I like reality more than books and movies. Recently, I'm reading a book called Am I too sensitive or are you too sensitive?"
8538,143,1,30,ESFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I believe that my success and the success of others are important. So, I am generously giving advice to others where it can be helpful."
8539,143,1,30,ESFJ,19,<no>  I have one interest. The reason is because my personality makes me mentally stressed when I am interested in many things.
8540,143,1,30,ESFJ,20,<Yes>  I often worry about things that don't even happen. The reason is that something I was sure of was wrong.
8541,143,1,30,ESFJ,21,<no>  like to lead groups. The reason is because I have worked as a team leader at work in the past.
8542,143,1,30,ESFJ,22,"<neutrality>  I seem to have some artistic inclinations. The reason is that I have no hobbies in fields such as art or movies, but I often hear stories that I am good at drawing."
8543,143,1,30,ESFJ,23,<neutrality>  I think a certain degree of harmony between emotion and reason is necessary. It would be because a society that is too rational cannot tolerate the mistakes of others.
8544,143,1,30,ESFJ,24,"<no>  I procrastinate doing housework as much as possible. The reason is because I am in charge of childcare and housework while working, so there is a lot of stress from housework."
8545,143,1,30,ESFJ,25,<no>  I think I want to avoid controversy. It's because the fatigue that comes from seeing each other blushing and discussing is great.
8546,143,1,30,ESFJ,26,<no>  feel like a person who needs attention. The reason is because I feel sad when someone doesn't pay attention to me.
8547,143,1,30,ESFJ,27,"<Yes>  I am prone to emotional ups and downs. The reason is because of the current illness, but after giving birth, I felt a drastic change in my emotions. So now I am taking the prescribed medication."
8548,143,1,30,ESFJ,28,<Yes>  get angry when I see people who are not effective. The reason is that even what might be going well can be close to failure if it is not handled efficiently.
8549,143,1,30,ESFJ,29,"<Yes>  often do what I want to do first and put off what I need to do until last. Lately, I feel like that in the rest of my life except for work. For example, if I have to pick up my child between 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM, I would first watch a video I wanted to do at home and then go pick it up around 4:25 PM."
8550,143,1,30,ESFJ,30,"<no>  I don't believe in an afterlife. There are many people who have passed away around me, but it is because I have not experienced that world yet."
8551,143,1,30,ESFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I've been enjoying being alone lately. However, sometimes I want to have a drink and talk with people at night, but after getting married and giving birth, I think it's difficult to enjoy such a daily life."
8552,143,1,30,ESFJ,32,<Yes>  I am interested in discussions based on experience. Because theory is too old-fashioned and uninteresting to me.
8553,143,1,30,ESFJ,33,<Yes>  I have great empathy. The reason is that I can easily empathize with people by listening to their stories and listening to a life different from mine.
8554,143,1,30,ESFJ,34,"<Yes>  I don't like repetition. I have a strong desire to make decisions as carefully as possible, so I tend to make decisions last."
8555,143,1,30,ESFJ,35,<Yes>  don't want to do anything to undo any decision. The reason is because I think it's something that can harm me and others.
8556,143,1,30,ESFJ,36,"<Yes>  Before I had children, I used to spend weekends with people. But these days, it's frustrating because there's no place to relieve the fatigue of the week."
8557,143,1,30,ESFJ,37,<no>  I hate the static atmosphere. That's why I find it more enjoyable to meet and talk with people than to appreciate art.
8558,143,1,30,ESFJ,38,"<no>  I can empathize well with other people's feelings. Most of the people I meet recently are mothers raising children like me. I understand the stress that comes from their married life and parenting style, and I'm not helping, but I'm giving a little advice."
8559,143,1,30,ESFJ,39,"<no>  am an unplanned person. As time goes by, I work according to the period and leave room for change rather than planning in my personal affairs."
8560,143,1,30,ESFJ,40,"<no>  As a natural tendency, I feel anxiety and nervousness well. There is no particular reason, and it seems like an innate personality."
8561,143,1,30,ESFJ,41,"<Yes>  prefer to communicate via text message or messenger. I used to work at a call center, and I often heard abusive language from customers who answered unwanted calls because I was doing outbound work."
8562,143,1,30,ESFJ,42,<no>  I don't spend time understanding opinions that differ from mine. It's because it's mentally stressful to coordinate with someone who has a different opinion anyway.
8563,143,1,30,ESFJ,43,"<no> I'm looking forward to hearing from you. In fact, it's because you don't have to stop meeting anyone."
8564,143,1,30,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  I try to set up a plan fee when my plan doesn't work. I recently went on a trip, and the restaurant I looked at earlier was closed. After a quick search, we moved to another restaurant."
8565,143,1,30,ESFJ,45,"<Yes>  seem to have many regrets in my life. Recently, I have invested in stocks or coins, but I keep thinking about the memory of not being able to make a profit, so I am regretting that I should not have invested in the first place."
8566,143,1,30,ESFJ,46,<Yes>  It seems to me that the reason for human existence and life flows according to the natural order. The reason is because I don't think that thinking deeply doesn't shorten or lengthen a person's lifespan.
8567,143,1,30,ESFJ,47,"<neutrality>  control my emotions, but sometimes I get swayed. There are many people around me who think the same as me. It is very difficult to maintain composure."
8568,143,1,30,ESFJ,48,"<Yes>  I am good at accepting the faults of others. Anyone can make a mistake, so I prefer to save face rather than point it out."
8581,144,1,40,ISTJ,1,<no>  don't put much effort into making new friends. It's because I'm happier taking care of the friends around me than worrying about getting to know new people.
8582,144,1,40,ISTJ,2,"<no>  I don't have a variety of interests, and I'm not the type to focus on them. It's baseball season these days, so I tend to watch my favorite team's games."
8583,144,1,40,ISTJ,3,"<neutrality>  I often cry with others when they cry. If that person's sadness is in line with my experience, it becomes my sadness."
8584,144,1,40,ISTJ,4,"<neutrality>  I tend to make preparations on a case-by-case basis. If I am responsible for the matter, I make several preparations, but when it is judged that it is not, I tend to relax and just follow the flow of the work or situation."
8585,144,1,40,ISTJ,5,"<no> When I'm under a lot of pressure, I tend to get a lot of tension. There was a case where I had to leave the house earlier than usual, but the night before, I couldn't sleep until late and woke up before the alarm time."
8586,144,1,40,ISTJ,6,"<neutrality>  Whether or not I introduce myself depends on whether I know someone at a party or event. If there is someone I know, I don't consider new people because I can have a comfortable conversation with that person, but if I don't know anyone, I introduce myself to the new person first to overcome the awkwardness of the situation."
8587,144,1,40,ISTJ,7,"<Yes>  I have to complete one project before starting another. This is because unfinished projects keep worrying about other projects, and it only takes more time."
8588,144,1,40,ISTJ,8,"<no>  I am realistic and rational. It's because when a situation shuts up, I tend to find a solution first rather than empathize with it."
8589,144,1,40,ISTJ,9,"<neutrality>  I tend to make plans for work. I write down the things I have to do that day in my diary, and at the end of the day, I check whether or not I have done it, and I keep track of the progress of the work. However, I am changing myself to do personal things as unplanned as possible."
8590,144,1,40,ISTJ,10,<Yes>  think mistakes are a matter of skill. It's because I didn't think and focus enough on the work. There are no recent mistakes.
8591,144,1,40,ISTJ,11,"<no>  It's not easy for me to approach the person I'm interested in first. I feel comfortable having conversations with people I have no relation to or interest in, but it's not easy to have a conversation with someone I'm interested in or nervous about because I'm very nervous before talking and I think about how they'll see me."
8592,144,1,40,ISTJ,12,<Yes>  I am not very interested in interpreting or discussing works of art. I believe that interpreting the meaning contained in a work of art is an individual domain. Sharing of interpretation is not interested in discussion beyond that because I think it is about sharing experience.
8593,144,1,40,ISTJ,13,"<Yes>  tend to follow reason. Sometimes it's enough just to feel deeply and share your feelings, but in most situations, you have to wake up and deal with it rationally to move in any direction. That's why I get a lot of trouble counseling from people around me."
8594,144,1,40,ISTJ,14,"<neutrality>  am both planned and spontaneous. I've been planning my day-to-day, and I've been having meetings with my daily life, so these days I tend to do impromptu things that don't interfere with the current situation. When I put a sudden thought into action, such as going to see the sea or making and eating certain food, the ability to execute, concentrate, and satisfaction with the task was quite high."
8595,144,1,40,ISTJ,15,"<no>  always care about who I look to other people. If you feel the expectations around you, you are afraid that you will be disappointed in them. That's why we pay more attention to external decorations or brag about our current situation."
8596,144,1,40,ISTJ,16,"<no>  I don't participate in group activities very often. Fatigue is felt more than the sense of belonging that comes from group activities. Especially these days, I live a more personal life with the excuse of the COVID-19 situation."
8597,144,1,40,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I like books and movies with clear endings. Recently, after watching movies such as Coco, Inside Out, and Broken Ron, I feel at ease and I like animations with clear content and ending."
8598,144,1,40,ISTJ,18,"<neutrality>  find satisfaction in both my own and others' success. We are pursuing daily success that allows us to taste small and trivial achievements, not grandiose successes, and that is how we bring joy to the day. When I get a job done well, when I find the answer I was looking for, when someone else does something well with my advice, I tend to feel satisfaction in the same amount."
8599,144,1,40,ISTJ,19,"<no>  I don't have many interests so there are times when I don't know what to do next. In order to feel free in life, I cut off all my minor interests, and now I often feel empty and bored."
8600,144,1,40,ISTJ,20,"<no>  I don't worry too much about things going wrong. I don't worry about anything because I think that whatever happens, the result comes according to the cause."
8601,144,1,40,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  tend to avoid leadership roles in groups as much as possible. It is because I think that it is not suitable for a leader role because it is enough to manage the tension alone when dealing with a big task, and I tend to work hard and happily in the role of supporting from the side and behind."
8602,144,1,40,ISTJ,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. This is because I am not particularly inspired by art works (paintings, sculptures, literature, etc.) that are often evaluated as outstanding."
8603,144,1,40,ISTJ,23,"<no>  It is a world where people live, not people, so I think we should sympathize with each other, lean on each other, and give and receive help. So while technological development requires more rationality, I think emotions should be valued more in this world where people live together."
8604,144,1,40,ISTJ,24,"<Yes>  like to relax after doing my chores. Because you keep thinking about unfinished housework throughout your break, you end up doing housework without being able to rest properly. Rest should be taken with a comfortable mind."
8605,144,1,40,ISTJ,25,"<no>  I don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. Very occasionally, there is pleasure in gaining new logic or knowledge in an argument, but generally, it is because there are many cases in which an argument becomes an argument or battle of emotional exhaustion, and I feel tired."
8606,144,1,40,ISTJ,26,<Yes>  I tend to try not to attract other people's attention. It's because they don't do anything that stands out or speak out loud.
8607,144,1,40,ISTJ,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change quickly. When I am upset or happy about something, it usually takes quite a while to come back to a calm state of mind."
8608,144,1,40,ISTJ,28,"<no>  don't get annoyed with people who aren't efficient. Feeling a bit frustrated and wanting to help, I deliberately ask the person about the current situation to guide them in a better direction."
8609,144,1,40,ISTJ,29,"<neutrality>  There were times when I put things off until the end. Usually, there are a lot of things that I put off until the end are annoying or I don't want to do them, so these days, I choose to take care of them as much as possible first and feel at ease."
8610,144,1,40,ISTJ,30,"<no>  I am not interested in questions about the afterlife. After death, I think that I will no longer be myself, and I am not interested in living in this world."
8611,144,1,40,ISTJ,31,"<no>  I like to spend time alone. I've been refraining from meeting other people lately, so I'm enjoying my time alone more."
8612,144,1,40,ISTJ,32,"<Yes>  I think original stories are boring. I am not interested in theory-centered discussions or principled stories because they seem to generally lead to the same conclusion, so I have a stronger idea that it is the domain of philosophers, scientists, thinkers, etc."
8613,144,1,40,ISTJ,33,"<no> I'm not very good at empathizing with people from completely different backgrounds. There is a person I recently met through an introduction, but his political orientation and economic ideology were very different from mine. I thought 'I can do that', but I came to the conclusion that 'it's not right for me' and no longer contacted me."
8614,144,1,40,ISTJ,34,"<no>  don't put off making decisions until the end. In my experience, there was no big difference between thinking for 3 days and thinking for 3 hours. If it's a necessary decision, I think it's more efficient to make a decision as quickly as possible and push forward the work, and I try to act like that."
8615,144,1,40,ISTJ,35,<Yes>  I tend not to think twice about decisions I have already made. I think it is better to work in a direction where the decision can be reasonable because things will already be progressing according to the decision.
8616,144,1,40,ISTJ,36,"<no>  I tend to relieve fatigue with alone time. Gathering with a large number of people is another fatigue for me, so I usually spend time alone to relieve fatigue."
8617,144,1,40,ISTJ,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries or looking at art. It is because the act of appreciating the work itself is unfamiliar, and I do not feel particularly inspired by seeing the work or listening to the explanation."
8618,144,1,40,ISTJ,38,"<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. Since I am mainly concerned with other people's eyes and attention, I have no great difficulty in understanding their emotions."
8619,144,1,40,ISTJ,39,"<neutrality>  also plan my daily to-dos. At work, I plan my to-dos each day, check my progress, and refer to tomorrow's plans. Personally, I want to do what I feel like at the time without a special plan."
8620,144,1,40,ISTJ,40,"<Yes>  don't feel insecure. Originally, I felt a lot of pressure and anxiety about doing well, being influenced by all circumstances and people around me, but after my younger brother passed away from illness, I began to have doubts about living with my thoughts and plans. Since then, I want to relax as much as possible, do what I like, or don't, but my inclination has changed. Thanks to that, I have very little anxiety now."
8621,144,1,40,ISTJ,41,"<Yes>  avoid making phone calls whenever possible. I want to avoid talking on the phone because it is difficult to hide the emotions expressed in my voice as something goes in real time, but it is difficult to understand the situation because I cannot see the other person's face."
8622,144,1,40,ISTJ,42,"<neutrality>  also take the time to understand opinions that are very different from mine. First of all, I would like to take some time to think about and understand why I have such thoughts about that person's opinion, if it is not someone I would just pass by now. That way, you can judge whether or not you should keep seeing him in the future and how far you will take the relationship."
8623,144,1,40,ISTJ,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to contact my friends to meet up first. I usually meet with friends who I contact first. I don't have the thought of maintaining a wide human relationship, and I don't put effort into it."
8624,144,1,40,ISTJ,44,"<neutrality>  tried to get back to the plan when things went wrong. If there was a setback in the progress of work, I would go back to the original plan and try to achieve the desired result somehow. But now, when setbacks arise, we either look for alternatives to suit the changed circumstances or let things flow. Recently, there was a change in the other person's work schedule, so there was a situation where my schedule was shifted. Once, I adjusted it to that schedule, but the second time, I shared the situation with the other person and got out of the task."
8625,144,1,40,ISTJ,45,"<no>  don't often regret the mistakes I made long ago. It's already happened anyway, and at that time, I would have dealt with or solved it within the scope of what I could do. Even if I go back then, I don't think I won't repeat the same mistake, so I don't have many cases of regret about the mistakes of a long time ago."
8626,144,1,40,ISTJ,46,"<Yes>  don't think about human beings and why they live. It wasn't something I was born with, and I think there were humans before me, and there will be humans after me, so I think it's more important to live happily in my current situation."
8627,144,1,40,ISTJ,47,"<neutrality>  tend to try to control my emotions. When I'm alone, I sometimes throw my emotions out into the air, but I tend to try to control my emotions. I show all my feelings to my best friend, but I act as rationally as possible to others, including my family, so the evaluations around me are different."
8628,144,1,40,ISTJ,48,"<Yes> Even if it's the other person's fault, I don't give a face. If you know your own fault, you will already suffer enough, so think about why this had to happen and try to minimize the other person's fault as much as possible."
8641,145,1,30,ENTP,1,"<Yes>  Unintentionally, you make new friends when your life circumference changes or when you take on a new project."
8642,145,1,30,ENTP,2,"<Yes> New interests always arise, so I research as soon as they arise and often use video media or content worth reading. I recently became interested in making money, so I started blogging as a long-term investment."
8643,145,1,30,ENTP,3,"<Yes>  Sometimes there are cases where other people's emotions come into play, but they seem to respond much more to those who try to control or accept their emotions rather than to those who cry or appeal."
8644,145,1,30,ENTP,4,"<no>  usually do not have a plan. If you have a plan, it is rather stressful, so it seems difficult to cope flexibly."
8645,145,1,30,ENTP,5,"<neutrality>  It's hard to keep calm when you're under pressure to do things quickly, but when you're not, or when making big decisions, you're calm."
8646,145,1,30,ENTP,6,"<Yes>  I don't have a lot of desire to meet new people. I'd rather spend time with someone I get along with or have fun with. Instead, even if it's new, if it seems like a good fit, you can talk well."
8647,145,1,30,ENTP,7,<no>  It's usually in the form of starting several things together and doing random projects that come to mind. I'm not the type to stick to one thing.
8648,145,1,30,ENTP,8,"<no>  If I have to choose between the two, I'm not sentimental. Rather, I listen well to being rational or cold-hearted. I tend to get very tired when there is emotional exhaustion, so there are parts of me that try not to get too caught up in the situation."
8649,145,1,30,ENTP,9,"<no>  Planning is incredibly stressful. It's stressful to stick to the plans that have been made, but the time to think through various things and make plans is a pain."
8650,145,1,30,ENTP,10,"<no>  I think it is possible to perform to some extent except for the occasional occurrence in human relationships. Since human relationships are unpredictable and there are many variables, I strongly believe that there is nothing I can do about it even if problems arise."
8651,145,1,30,ENTP,11,"<neutrality>  It's not difficult to talk to someone you're a good match for or someone you're interested in, but it's very difficult to talk to someone you don't like."
8652,145,1,30,ENTP,12,"<no>  My major is culture and arts, and I do a lot of discussions and discussions. I also like discussions, so I'm the type to bring up a story even if others aren't interested."
8653,145,1,30,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  Think of yourself as rational, and evaluate others the same. Emotional people sometimes say things like too much or too cold."
8654,145,1,30,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  It's very spontaneous. Even if you make an appointment and move, if there is a place that comes to mind in the middle, you may be asked to change it. I don't bother to do research because it's annoying, but when I think about it, I don't like other places."
8655,145,1,30,ENTP,15,"<no>  Since I was young, I have been criticized for being unique or different, so I no longer worry about how I look to others."
8656,145,1,30,ENTP,16,"<neutrality>  I go to any topic I am interested in or if there are people I am interested in, but if I am not a good fit, I actively avoid it."
8657,145,1,30,ENTP,17,"<Yes>  Recently, I have been watching a lot of Bollywood works, and I like to critique works that show the mythical worldview of Indians and relate them to mythology. I recently watched RRR."
8658,145,1,30,ENTP,18,"<no>  There is no satisfaction you get from helping others succeed. There is a sense of satisfaction if the work produces the desired result, but simply because others are good does not bring satisfaction."
8659,145,1,30,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  As a foreign language major, I studied the political, social, and cultural characteristics of the countries where the language was spoken. In addition to this, I took classes such as mythology, philosophy, psychology, history, and psychoanalysis so deeply that I barely studied my major. I have many experiences like this."
8660,145,1,30,ENTP,20,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to worry about things going wrong, but I tend to think about them to come up with countermeasures when things go wrong."
8661,145,1,30,ENTP,21,"<Yes>  There are so many things to pay attention to emotionally, especially to deal with irrational complaints, so I have a difficult experience, so I want to avoid it."
8662,145,1,30,ENTP,22,<no>  I am currently working in the field of culture and art. There's nothing wrong with coming up with ideas or trying new things.
8663,145,1,30,ENTP,23,"<neutrality>  There are situations in which reason should be valued more than emotions, and there are situations, fields, and viewpoints in which it is not. This kind of question, which is more appropriate, is not a part that can be answered with a short answer, and I think it should be determined differently based on the field, occupation, point of view, situation, and opponent."
8664,145,1,30,ENTP,24,"<no>  tend to put off things I don't want to do until as late as possible. If you want to take a break right now, take a break first and drive it later."
8665,145,1,30,ENTP,25,"<Yes>  When you exchange opinions, your inner self comes out, and it's fun to discover parts you don't know while looking at these contents."
8666,145,1,30,ENTP,26,"<neutrality>  I don't bother avoiding the parts I'm good at and I'm confident in, and I don't bother drawing attention if I'm going to be given a job."
8667,145,1,30,ENTP,27,"<Yes>  It changes frequently from moment to moment, depending on the situation, who I am with, and my current state. I heard something in the office today, and then depending on who I talked to, it felt unpleasant or funny."
8668,145,1,30,ENTP,28,"<Yes>  It's a situation where there is obviously a reasonable solution, but it gets annoying when the other person doesn't see it or doesn't understand even after explaining it."
8669,145,1,30,ENTP,29,"<Yes>  I only have to finish it within this year, but in fact, I'm still holding on to what I was all hoping to finish in June."
8670,145,1,30,ENTP,30,<Yes>  More interesting than the afterlife itself is how people imagine it.
8671,145,1,30,ENTP,31,"<neutrality> When my condition is good, I meet a lot of people, but when my condition is bad, I tend to avoid people. I lived in seclusion for three to four months, but recently I'm meeting a lot of people because my condition is good."
8672,145,1,30,ENTP,32,"<neutrality>  I believe that a discussion must have a theory and a realistic alternative to be meaningful, so I think a discussion centered only on theory is not boring, but rather meaningless."
8673,145,1,30,ENTP,33,"<neutrality> It is possible to interpret the work or the characters in the work, but it is difficult to say that you can easily sympathize in a short time because sufficient information is given."
8674,145,1,30,ENTP,34,"<no>  Decision making is fast. However, it takes a long time to run."
8675,145,1,30,ENTP,35,"<Yes>  I don't tend to think twice before big events or unexpected things happen. Since most of the cases were considered and a decision was made, if there is no new data, I think it is correct and proceed."
8676,145,1,30,ENTP,36,"<no>  I am very sensitive to sound, so I tend to meet friends in quiet or secluded places rather than crowded and noisy places. I usually go to small gatherings."
8677,145,1,30,ENTP,37,<Yes>  I am greatly inspired by what I do and I think it is very important to see my work in humans.
8678,145,1,30,ENTP,38,"<no> Understanding emotions is not difficult. However, it's difficult to act the way you want to. If someone with a different disposition wants to hear their story, you can immediately notice it, but it seems very difficult to listen."
8679,145,1,30,ENTP,39,"<no>  Planning is a very difficult thing for me. Many thoughts come to mind, such as why I can't keep it. However, I make notes to the extent of writing down what needs to be done. It's to the extent that I sometimes look at the notes and do what I can or pull."
8680,145,1,30,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  I am not nervous about things going wrong, but I often feel anxiety about the very distant future. I tend to be sensitive, but when I live in Korea, it seems that the overall feeling of society is affected by high levels of anxiety and stress."
8681,145,1,30,ENTP,41,"<neutrality>  I absolutely avoid talking to people I don't like, I don't answer calls at all on my days off, but I don't avoid making calls."
8682,145,1,30,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  I have very different political views from my grandfather, and I wanted to understand, so I asked him about his experience during the Yukio War. After understanding, I felt much lighter."
8683,145,1,30,ENTP,43,"<neutrality>  Each friend is different, but I ask friends who I really like or want to meet at that time. I don't bother to meet up with friends I know, but when I have time, I go out when they contact me."
8684,145,1,30,ENTP,44,"<no>  I don't think it's very meaningful to make a plan itself, and I think it can be modified if necessary."
8685,145,1,30,ENTP,45,"<neutrality>  There was a time when my face was hot because I gave a very wrong answer, but I think I learned a lot recently because I did that then."
8686,145,1,30,ENTP,46,"<no>  I think a lot. It's an important part, and I think if you don't stand up right away, you'll live a life of regret."
8687,145,1,30,ENTP,47,"<no>  Lately, I rarely get swayed by my emotions except for a dizzying event. A lot of other people say it's calm."
8688,145,1,30,ENTP,48,"<no>  If it is clear that there is a mistake, go personally and talk to the responsible department. I've seen a lot of cases where someone else overwrites unless that person takes responsibility or sees things that went wrong."
8701,146,1,40,ESFJ,1,<Yes>  I think friends are the driving force of life. The reason is because I make new friends periodically and new friends become vitality in my life without change.
8702,146,1,40,ESFJ,2,"<neutrality>  In my free time, I often watch TV, mainly the news. The reason is that I am very interested in today's events and politics. It's because our country's politics are so messy these days."
8703,146,1,40,ESFJ,3,"<neutrality>  I think when someone else is crying, if I knew why, I would want to cry, but if not, why? The reason is that if I can sympathize with the reason for crying, it is only natural that I will want to cry."
8704,146,1,40,ESFJ,4,"<Yes>  always have several plans in place when something happens. The reason is that if you set up only one countermeasure, it may not be solved, so I always set up two or more countermeasures."
8705,146,1,40,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  No matter what happens, if I think my opinion is right, I will not bend my opinion no matter how much I talk to the side. The reason is that you always take responsibility for your words."
8706,146,1,40,ESFJ,6,<Yes>  tend to talk to people I know at parties and events because it's awkward in a new environment. The reason is that it is awkward in a new environment and needs more time to adapt to people and environments.
8707,146,1,40,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  tend to complete one project before starting another. The reason is that if you do both at once, no matter how hard you try, there will always be a lack. The same goes for food. If you make another side dish after making soup, if you season it later, something is missing."
8708,146,1,40,ESFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I am sentimental, but also rational. This is because it is highly influenced by the environment."
8709,146,1,40,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  I tend to plan with a schedule or list. And if I don't do that, I feel uncomfortable because I feel like something is out of order. So, I have a habit of taking notes, so I always use the diary."
8710,146,1,40,ESFJ,10,"<Yes>  often doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. I tend to make mistakes these days, so even when chatting with friends, I ask 'Is this correct?' There are many times when I search while doing so and then send a KakaoTalk message."
8711,146,1,40,ESFJ,11,"<Yes>  Most of the time, I tend to approach people I'm interested in and try to talk to them. I wouldn't say it's easy, but I like to do average. Most of the time, it's because it's easy to get closer by talking about yourself and that person's interests."
8712,146,1,40,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  Since I don't know art well, I'm not very interested in interpreting it as I see it. The reason is that they are not interested in art and do not know it well."
8713,146,1,40,ESFJ,13,"<neutrality>  I am emotional, but I also tend to follow reason. When I judge, I tend to be influenced a lot by the environment, and people around me tend to say that I am infinitely calm when I am calm."
8714,146,1,40,ESFJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan my day and always be active. Otherwise, I like an anxious and planned life, and in the case of spontaneity, mistakes are bound to follow."
8715,146,1,40,ESFJ,15,"<neutrality>  You may worry about who you are to be seen by others. I don't like being seen as a bad person by others, so I'm a bit conscious of the other person."
8716,146,1,40,ESFJ,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy participating in group activities. These days, it can be said that it is more because of Corona."
8717,146,1,40,ESFJ,17,"<Yes>  I like to interpret the ending in my own way. Recently, after watching the drama 'The Strange Lawyer Woo Young-woo', I used to predict and evaluate the ending by myself. Of course, it was far from my ending, but I enjoy it."
8718,146,1,40,ESFJ,18,<Yes>  I find greater satisfaction in helping others succeed. The reason is because I think others' success is my success and I like to work hard for the team.
8719,146,1,40,ESFJ,19,"<no>  These days, I am interested in political articles because our country is so dizzy. But there's never a time when you don't know what to do next. The reason is because you live a planned life."
8720,146,1,40,ESFJ,20,"<neutrality>  I am often worried that things might go wrong. However, I am not the type to worry often because I always go over things once I've done them."
8721,146,1,40,ESFJ,21,<Yes>  I would like to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group whenever possible. It's because I think it's a little embarrassing to speak in front of others. So I think the role of responding to the opinions of others is more suitable for me.
8722,146,1,40,ESFJ,22,<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that they only know how to listen to music and cannot even draw pictures when it comes to art.
8723,146,1,40,ESFJ,23,<Yes>  I think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. It's because I think it's hard to plan a big deal with emotions.
8724,146,1,40,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  I like to finish my chores before going to bed. This is because, in all things, if there is something you have been doing, you have to finish it and take a break to think that it is a true break."
8725,146,1,40,ESFJ,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. Of course, it may be different from my opinion or it may be the same, but I enjoy it because I think it represents my opinion."
8726,146,1,40,ESFJ,26,"<Yes>  I tend not to attract other people's attention. It's because I'm the type of person who doesn't talk much, and when I draw attention to others, I feel ashamed because I have to answer."
8727,146,1,40,ESFJ,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. This is because once you think about it, that feeling is an unchanging character."
8728,146,1,40,ESFJ,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who aren't as effective as I am. The reason is that while I first consider efficiency in my work and do it in a planned way, I get frustrated and annoyed when I see friends who don't."
8729,146,1,40,ESFJ,29,"<no>  I seldom put things off until the end. If there is something to be done, you must see it through to the end, and your intuition will be relieved, and you will rarely procrastinate."
8730,146,1,40,ESFJ,30,<no>  I don't find the question of the afterlife interesting. The reason may be that I haven't thought about it that way yet.
8731,146,1,40,ESFJ,31,"<Yes>  I like to spend time with others rather than alone. I don't know if it's because the season is autumn these days, but I'm lonely when I'm alone, so I like to make appointments with others and spend time with them."
8732,146,1,40,ESFJ,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I find principled stories boring. I don't know if I'm interested in the field, but I'm not familiar with the field, and even if I know the field, theory-based discussions are too boring."
8733,146,1,40,ESFJ,33,"<no>  cannot easily empathize with someone whose background is completely different from my own. The reason is, how could I understand that person if I hadn't lived that person's life? Even if you agree, I don't think it's sincere."
8734,146,1,40,ESFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to put off making decisions until the last minute. I'm not the type to procrastinate when it comes to work, but when I make a decision, I have to make a careful decision, so I tend to think about it until the end and do it over and over again."
8735,146,1,40,ESFJ,35,<neutrality>  There are times when I think about the decisions I have already made. It seems that there are times when I think about the consequences of making a different decision.
8736,146,1,40,ESFJ,36,"<no>  I don't think it's bad to spend time alone. It's good to have a fun party event, but if you enjoy it like that, there are times when you get more tired."
8737,146,1,40,ESFJ,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. The reason is that I don't like art, and I'm not familiar with art."
8738,146,1,40,ESFJ,38,"<Yes>  I often find it difficult to understand other people's feelings. If you have a different opinion than mine, it is often difficult to understand why you think that way."
8739,146,1,40,ESFJ,39,<Yes>  like to plan and take notes on my daily to-dos. The reason is that you have to plan and take notes so that you don't forget to complete your work thoroughly.
8740,146,1,40,ESFJ,40,<Yes>  I don't think most of the time I feel anxious. It seems that there are very few times when I feel anxious when I am planned in my work.
8741,146,1,40,ESFJ,41,"<no>  believe that making phone calls is a must, if necessary. It's because there are many times when I think it's perfect to work while listening to the voice directly without delay when I have to make a phone call."
8742,146,1,40,ESFJ,42,"<neutrality>  believe that making phone calls is a must, if necessary. It's because there are many times when I think it's perfect to work while listening to the voice directly without delay when I have to make a phone call."
8743,146,1,40,ESFJ,43,<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends to meet up first. It's because I contact you first to meet when the time is right.
8744,146,1,40,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  If my plans go wrong, I tend to try to get back to them as quickly as possible. I always work in a planned way, but when the schedule gets twisted, there are many times when things get out of hand, so I always try to move according to the plan."
8745,146,1,40,ESFJ,45,"<no>  I do not regret my old mistakes. Even if I made a mistake, I don't regret it because I have the personality to quickly forget it."
8746,146,1,40,ESFJ,46,<Yes>  I tend not to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. The reason is because I think living hard in the present is more important than anything else.
8747,146,1,40,ESFJ,47,"<no>  I'm not the type to be swayed by emotions rather than to control them. I'm not the type to be swayed by other people's emotions, but I can control my emotions."
8748,146,1,40,ESFJ,48,"<Yes>  I tend to try to save the other person's face even when it's obvious that it's their fault. The reason is that I know it's the other person's fault and the other person knows it, so I think saving face is the priority."
8761,147,1,40,INTJ,1,<no>  You don't feel the need for new friends. I think the time alone is more precious than going through such a process.
8762,147,1,40,INTJ,2,"<Yes>  I am curious and interested in many things. First of all, I watch a lot of YouTube and read books. I am interested in real estate and stock related content."
8763,147,1,40,INTJ,3,"<Yes>  I feel like I get emotional as I get older. If you can sympathize with sadness, you will cry. The reason is because I want to cry together and hope that my tears will help that person."
8764,147,1,40,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  I'm the type to worry about the future. The reason is that I like to make plans, but when things go wrong, I get very angry. So, if things don't go right, we have prepared several countermeasures to proceed sequentially."
8765,147,1,40,INTJ,5,"<no> He has a very impatient personality and is not good at maintaining his composure. Most of the time, when a child plays a lot of jokes or behaves rudely in a place where there are many people, he can't stand it and gets angry."
8766,147,1,40,INTJ,6,"<neutrality>  It depends on what seat you are in. If it is a position to introduce actively, approach new people first. For example, if the event is related to children, I introduce myself first. If it's not a place where I really want to show myself, I'm just there."
8767,147,1,40,INTJ,7,"<Yes>  I'm not multiplayer. The reason is that I can't handle multiple things quickly at once. Even when cooking, you can only do one menu item at a time."
8768,147,1,40,INTJ,8,"<no>  Personally, I think it's on the rational side. They are not moved by their surroundings or by art and performances."
8769,147,1,40,INTJ,9,"<no> Make a plan, but don't make a schedule or list and write it down. I think roughly with my head and try to keep it. A year's plan is recorded on a desk calendar."
8770,147,1,40,INTJ,10,<no>  I tend to make a lot of small mistakes. I think passing it lightly is not stressful.
8771,147,1,40,INTJ,11,"<no>  It's hard to start a conversation even if you're interested. The reason is that I don't feel the need to have a conversation first in an awkward atmosphere. Shall we talk first? Even if I do, why do I have to? I think."
8772,147,1,40,INTJ,12,"<Yes>  I have a very low understanding of works of art. I don't know why, but it's impossible to interpret and discuss."
8773,147,1,40,INTJ,13,<Yes>  I follow reason. The reason is that emotional things make it difficult for me. Objective judgment based on reason has yielded much better results. I often hear people say that I am too rational.
8774,147,1,40,INTJ,14,"<neutrality>  plan it once, but there are many times when it changes spontaneously. In particular, there are times when I do what I want to do according to my mood."
8775,147,1,40,INTJ,15,"<no>  I am very worried. I always worry about the gaze and evaluation of others. I think, is it because my self-esteem is low as I get older?"
8776,147,1,40,INTJ,16,"<no>  I don't want to participate in group activities if possible. Just the thought of having to participate is daunting. Most of the time, I'm alone or I meet up with really close acquaintances occasionally."
8777,147,1,40,INTJ,17,"<Yes>  I like works that have a happy ending. The reason is that it makes you feel comfortable and feels good. When you meet a bad ending that you didn't expect, it leaves an afterimage in your head and feels like stress. I recently enjoyed watching Top Gun 2."
8778,147,1,40,INTJ,18,"<no> My success matters and I crave it. When I see the success of others, I am envious and envious. If I am in a position where I can help others after I become very successful, I think I will be able to get satisfaction from helping others succeed."
8779,147,1,40,INTJ,19,"<Yes>  I am a very curious person. The reason is because there are so many things I want to do. There are many things I want to learn using the Learn Tomorrow card, but I'm sad that the reality is impossible because I don't have time."
8780,147,1,40,INTJ,20,"<no>  have a positive mindset and think that most things will work out. In fact, more good things happen. There is a preconceived notion that negativity is not good for results."
8781,147,1,40,INTJ,21,"<Yes>  I hate the role of leader. The reason is that I am good at it myself, but I want to be a leader and take responsibility and avoid being judged by many people."
8782,147,1,40,INTJ,22,<Yes>  am not moved by anything about art. The reason is because I don't understand it well. I think you have a rational disposition and lack the ability to think deeply.
8783,147,1,40,INTJ,23,<no>  Leaning to one side is very dangerous. I think balance is important. There are things to solve emotionally and rationally in the world. Applying it properly will make the world a better place.
8784,147,1,40,INTJ,24,"<no> rest comes first It's hard to do housework well enough to be satisfied in a very stressful state, so I start after enough rest."
8785,147,1,40,INTJ,25,<Yes>  I'm curious about other people's opinions. The reason is that my opinions and comparisons are possible. Sometimes I end up rooting for someone who shares my opinion and I want to help.
8786,147,1,40,INTJ,26,<Yes>  I hate splashing. The reason is that it is better to be alone in a familiar space.
8787,147,1,40,INTJ,27,<Yes>  I think there is a hormonal effect. The reason is that there are big changes in emotions around the time of menstruation every month. There are many things that make me angry all of a sudden. Even the smallest mistake of a child is greatly angered and regretted.
8788,147,1,40,INTJ,28,<Yes>  I like people who do a good job. The reason is because I think it's natural to try to do well. People who don't do it right do damage. It sucks to go through things like that.
8789,147,1,40,INTJ,29,"<Yes>  I am weak in stamina. It is difficult to put into practice a plan that has been made in advance. In particular, you procrastinate doing household chores. Various tax returns are also delayed until the end."
8790,147,1,40,INTJ,30,<no>  I don't care about the afterlife and I don't know much about it. A person who thinks that death is the end.
8791,147,1,40,INTJ,31,<neutrality>  I like to spend most of my time alone. But sometimes you just want to meet someone you can talk to and have a cup of coffee.
8792,147,1,40,INTJ,32,"<no>  It depends on what kind of discussion topic it is, but I have never felt that theory-based discussions are boring. I especially enjoy listening to discussions about politics and economy."
8793,147,1,40,INTJ,33,"<neutrality>  Rather than sympathy, it is possible to just react positively. Most of the people around you are from different backgrounds, so if you can't empathize, it's going to be difficult for you to have a social life."
8794,147,1,40,INTJ,34,"<no>  I tend to thoroughly research everything beforehand, so I can make decisions quickly. Of course, difficult decisions aren't easy to make, but don't put them off until the end."
8795,147,1,40,INTJ,35,"<Yes>  I am a person with a positive mindset. I do a lot of research before making a decision and I am confident that it will work out, so I do not think again and regret it."
8796,147,1,40,INTJ,36,"<no>  Absolutely not. Parties and events are hard for me. These days, more and more people are avoiding events. Even family gatherings are reluctant."
8797,147,1,40,INTJ,37,<Yes>  I like art galleries. The reason is because you can think quietly. I like art museums because they have a good atmosphere rather than being moved by art works.
8798,147,1,40,INTJ,38,"<Yes>  I have a hard time understanding my child's feelings. The reason is that it is difficult to sincerely understand and sympathize with the child's feelings when he is crying, angry, or irritated. I don't feel the feelings of a child in such a situation."
8799,147,1,40,INTJ,39,"<neutrality>  I don't like to plan my daily to-dos, but I think it's necessary. I try to make a plan and execute it on a daily basis, as small as a month."
8800,147,1,40,INTJ,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. They tend to worry about and prepare for the future rather than the present, so no matter how positively they try to think, it is difficult to shake off their anxiety."
8801,147,1,40,INTJ,41,"<no>  When I express my argument or express my dissatisfaction, in case of an important contract, I do it over the phone. It can work much more efficiently."
8802,147,1,40,INTJ,42,"<no> They are not tolerant enough to spend a lot of time to understand other opinions. It's different from my opinion, but if we can't adjust to each other, we give up."
8803,147,1,40,INTJ,43,"<no>  We don't meet often, but when we think of our friends, we don't contact them first. Instead, if you contact me, I will definitely meet you."
8804,147,1,40,INTJ,44,"<Yes>  I have a quick run. I decided to go on a long-term overseas business trip with my husband, but it was difficult to solve the child's school problem, so I decided to leave the country first and solve the problem before going with the child."
8805,147,1,40,INTJ,45,"<Yes>  I have a quick run. I decided to go on a long-term overseas business trip with my husband, but it was difficult to solve the child's school problem, so I decided to leave the country first and solve the problem before going with the child."
8806,147,1,40,INTJ,46,<no>  Think deeply. Always thoughtful and serious. Think about why you live and what you die. I wonder why. I would like to know. But I don't think there is an answer.
8807,147,1,40,INTJ,47,"<neutrality>  Pursue rational judgment about things that can be controlled. However, there are many times when you have to be emotional, you lose your reason. I don't know about the evaluation of the surroundings."
8808,147,1,40,INTJ,48,"<no> Admitting mistakes is important. When you admit it, of course you think you save face."
8821,148,0,30,ESTP,1,"<no>  It's not an environment where you can make friends periodically, and even if you can, it's because you want a narrow and deep relationship."
8822,148,0,30,ESTP,2,"<Yes>  In my little free time, I acquire various knowledge. I usually explore knowledge in many fields, but these days I am interested in science, especially physics."
8823,148,0,30,ESTP,3,<neutrality>  Most of the time I don't want to cry. They seem to be thinking about why that person is crying and how to solve it.
8824,148,0,30,ESTP,4,"<Yes>  I always make a hole through which I can escape when I'm doing something. Because when things go wrong, serious problems can arise if there is no preparedness."
8825,148,0,30,ESTP,5,"<Yes>  When I was younger, I was very nervous and trembled a lot. However, after serving in the military and growing older, I have accumulated social experience, so now I tend to maintain a lot of composure. I had a job interview recently, and I had many memories when I was young and couldn't speak well because I was shaking, but this time I was so calm."
8826,148,0,30,ESTP,6,"<neutrality>  It depends. If there are people I know, of course I usually talk to people I know. But if I don't know anyone, or if there's someone I'm interested in, I'll talk to them first."
8827,148,0,30,ESTP,7,"<no> Unless the schedule is completely separate projects, I tend to work on several at the same time. If you have a good schedule, it is more efficient to do it at the same time. Concentrating all one's energy on a single project can be efficient, but in my experience, it was more efficient to proceed at the right time."
8828,148,0,30,ESTP,8,"<no>  I don't think it's that sentimental. Of course, I shed tears when I watch a sad movie, and I laugh happily when I watch a funny movie, but that's about it. I don't have a lot of emotional ups and downs."
8829,148,0,30,ESTP,9,"<Yes>  When I plan, I usually write in Excel. If you write it in Excel, you can see the progress of the project at a glance, and you can use various formulas to emphasize each important point, so it's fun to see along with a sense of accomplishment."
8830,148,0,30,ESTP,10,<no>  don't doubt my ability even if it's a small mistake. I think you have to make a big mistake to doubt your ability or knowledge. I remember days when I spent days drinking because I made a big mistake on a recent project.
8831,148,0,30,ESTP,11,"<Yes>  I usually go first when meeting new people. Of course, there is a condition that the person must be the person I need. For example, at a small social event after participating in a seminar, I tend to greet and approach people who need me first."
8832,148,0,30,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in the art itself. Also, the criteria for a work of art are different depending on the viewer, and I have a strong feeling that meaning is given to slightly unnecessary objects, so I tend not to put much meaning into interpretation. What I see and what I feel is interpretation for me, and I don¡¯t bother to share that feeling with others."
8833,148,0,30,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  I'm not a very emotional person, and I tend to follow reason most of the time. The evaluations around me are similar. When comparing emotions and reason, it would be about 3:7."
8834,148,0,30,ESTP,14,"<neutrality> Holidays and weekdays are different. Usually, if there is no special vacation plan or schedule during the holidays, I tend to spend it spontaneously. Instead, on weekdays, I tend to organize what I have to do that day in my head. That said, I don't write it down in detail in my diary, etc."
8835,148,0,30,ESTP,15,"<no>  I always worry about what kind of person I will appear to others. Ever since I was little, I think I was always conscious of others. I think it's especially true for people I'm interested in or like. Of course, worrying about it and trying to look good are two different things."
8836,148,0,30,ESTP,16,"<Yes>  I tend to enjoy group activities that interest me. It's always fun to get together with good people. However, these days, it seems that there is almost nothing to go to new meetings except for the meetings that have been existing. Also, it's not easy to get together as people in the same group start to get busy."
8837,148,0,30,ESTP,17,"<no>  I like works that have a clear ending. Ambiguous open endings are one of the endings I hate. Just looking at the recently popular drama Mysterious Lawyer Woo Young-woo, it's the kind of ending I hate the most. It ended in a haphazard way without anything properly organized."
8838,148,0,30,ESTP,18,"<no>  I am active in helping others succeed. Sometimes I put my work aside and help out. But that doesn't mean I feel more satisfaction with the success of others than my own. After all, helping others is possible only when I succeed and thrive."
8839,148,0,30,ESTP,19,"<no> There are things that interest me, but they don't interfere with my work. There are many things I want to do and many things I want to challenge, but that is possible only if it does not interfere with my work."
8840,148,0,30,ESTP,20,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. When I'm doing something I'm confident in, I tend not to worry too much. However, it tends to be like that when you start out without confidence. I don't think there is any particular occasion or reason. I'm just wondering if it's just my personality."
8841,148,0,30,ESTP,21,"<no>  I like to play a leadership role in a field that I know well and can do well. Of course, there are times when it's annoying, but if you put your mind to it, you'll be the leader. Of course, it doesn't matter if there is a better leader than me, but it's because I don't like seeing people who think they're worse than me lead."
8842,148,0,30,ESTP,22,"<Yes>  completely absent I can't sing, I can't draw, I can't dance. I can't even write. I live by thinking that I have no art-related DNA."
8843,148,0,30,ESTP,23,"<no>  think the most ideal state is when emotion and rationality harmonize. If we only value rationality, the world will become desolate. Of course, the efficiency aspect may have gone up, but I think reason without emotions is too unstable."
8844,148,0,30,ESTP,24,<no>  I do it when I want to. It¡¯s the style of resting when you¡¯re tired and tidying up when the house looks dirty. I don't think you have to take a break after you've done your chores.
8845,148,0,30,ESTP,25,"<no> I'm not happy. If it's a debate in a field I'm familiar with, I have to intervene in it. It's so embarrassing to not be able to speak and just watch."
8846,148,0,30,ESTP,26,<no>  Always trying to get attention. I wish I could always be the main character in a gathering of many people. I like to lead the topic of every conversation. It's too boring if a topic I don't know is out of conversation with me.
8847,148,0,30,ESTP,27,"<no>  It's not a big change in emotions. I'm not sure of the normal standard, but it's just an average person's level. I get angry at situations that make others angry and cry at situations that make others cry. I think it's normal."
8848,148,0,30,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed and frustrated when I see people working inefficiently next to me. Especially when I see people ignoring me with their own stubbornness when I tell them more efficient methods, it boils over. Speaking of experience, I remember a friend who told me to do something like this, but when I go later, I do it the way I normally do, but I don't get any efficiency."
8849,148,0,30,ESTP,29,"<neutrality> When I was young, I often put off assignments or studying for tests until the end. But as I get older and work, it doesn't happen often. I think it was simply because there is a deadline for assignments or exams, but it¡¯s okay if you don¡¯t do it. These days, there's nothing I can do if I don't do it."
8850,148,0,30,ESTP,30,<Yes>  fun. I hope someone can clarify about the afterlife. I think it's natural to be curious about the roads I've never been to. And I think it's more interesting because it's a part that can't be revealed no matter what you do in the future.
8851,148,0,30,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  It's half and half. Of course I like to play with others. However, I need my own personal time as well. I think it's best to hang out moderately and spend moderately alone time. These days, I think I can increase the amount of time I spend with others."
8852,148,0,30,ESTP,32,"<Yes> In fact, I don't think I've ever had a discussion centered on theory. But thinking about it, I think it would be boring. When it comes to discussion, I think it's fun when each person's thoughts come together, not theories."
8853,148,0,30,ESTP,33,"<no>  It's not easy to relate to someone whose background is completely different from mine. I think that people from different worlds have different backgrounds. I don't know it on the outside, but on the inside, I don't think it's easy to absolutely empathize with that person."
8854,148,0,30,ESTP,34,"<no>  Once I am sure that all the necessary opinions and data have been gathered, I make a decision right away. There is no guarantee that good results will come out if you think about it until the end. I think it's better to make a decision quickly when you're sure, and think about how to lead this decision in a good direction for the rest of the time."
8855,148,0,30,ESTP,35,"<Yes> For now, I tend not to think about the outcome of that decision until it comes out. It's better to think about a better direction according to the decision at the time of thinking like that."
8856,148,0,30,ESTP,36,"<no>  When I'm tired, I spend time alone. Parties and events only add to the fatigue. Of course, the stress will be relieved. When I really need to relieve fatigue, I tend to rest at home."
8857,148,0,30,ESTP,37,"<no>  don't like to look at my work in silence. In fact, I don't even know what it is. I should like it when I see it, but I don't like it because I've never felt that way."
8858,148,0,30,ESTP,38,"<no>  There is no particular case where it is difficult to understand emotions. Of course, I don't know if the other person completely hides their emotions, but if they don't, I can understand most of them."
8859,148,0,30,ESTP,39,"<neutrality>  Not until I like it. However, I picture in my head what I have to do every day. I don't write it down anywhere in particular."
8860,148,0,30,ESTP,40,"<no>  I don't have a special reason, but sometimes I feel insecure. Anxiety about the future life. I guess that's what everyone feels. Anxiety about whether I can live like this, or whether I should do something else, or whether I have become too lazy. I don't think there are that many times. Literally very occasionally."
8861,148,0,30,ESTP,41,"<Yes>  I think making phone calls takes up too much of my personal time. In that respect, I prefer messenger. I can do other things while I'm conveying my opinion and waiting for others' opinions. I don't prefer it because I have to focus entirely on the call when I'm on the phone."
8862,148,0,30,ESTP,42,"<no>  In most cases, I give up on understanding. If the opinion is logically correct, I will think about it, but if it is not, I will not understand. Also, I think it is impossible to understand because there may be parts where each other's thoughts are literally different. I think I had a lot of experiences like that in many debate classes when I was a college student."
8863,148,0,30,ESTP,43,"<Yes>  If I am bored and want to play, please contact me first. I tend to take the initiative in making appointments."
8864,148,0,30,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  In most cases, we try to get back to the original plan. Of course, it's not that difficult because I always plan ahead with my free time. It's a common occurrence when a sudden appointment arose during the planned day. Even if my appointment ends late, I tend to finish my plans for the day as much as possible before going to bed."
8865,148,0,30,ESTP,45,"<no>  not much. It's just that I think about it sometimes when I sleep. In the past, the academy teacher and the students had a dinner together, and I sent a KakaoTalk message to another friend with the nuance of ""Ah~ the teacher came with you, aren't you leaving soon?"", and the teacher saw it. I still think of this from time to time."
8866,148,0,30,ESTP,46,"<Yes>  think about it sometimes, but it's not that deep. It's just that I look back once in a while. Maybe it's because you think it's an act that doesn't benefit."
8867,148,0,30,ESTP,47,"<no>  I don't think there are that many cases of being swayed by emotions. I don't think I'm swayed by my emotions except when I'm really, really angry. I don't think anyone thinks that I'm being swayed by my emotions especially when it comes to the evaluations around me."
8868,148,0,30,ESTP,48,"<no>  I don't bother trying to save the other person's face. Of course, I would press back and say things so as not to lose face, but I'm not the type to even try. Because wrong is wrong."
8881,149,1,30,ESTJ,1,<no>  I don't make friends regularly. The reason is because you are satisfied with the friend next to you right now.
8882,149,1,30,ESTJ,2,<no>  am not. The reason is because I'm so busy with my current job that I don't have time to spare.
8883,149,1,30,ESTJ,3,"<Yes>  When the other person cries, I also shed tears. The reason is because my heart is weak without knowing it, so tears come out first."
8884,149,1,30,ESTJ,4,<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that I tend to look at the situation and think about whether I should talk to that person before making a decision.
8885,149,1,30,ESTJ,5,"<no>  am unable to maintain. The reason is that in a high-pressure environment, my mind becomes impatient and I feel severely stressed thinking that I have to solve it quickly."
8886,149,1,30,ESTJ,6,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is because of my personality, I look at the situation and judge whether or not it is okay to talk to someone first."
8887,149,1,30,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is that if I don't complete it, I will keep thinking about it next time, so I must do it."
8888,149,1,30,ESTJ,8,<neutrality>  am not sentimental. It's because there aren't too many things to be sad or happy about.
8889,149,1,30,ESTJ,9,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is that I tend to leave immediately on the fly, so I don't like making a list."
8890,149,1,30,ESTJ,10,<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is because there are times when you see the situation and there are times when it is not.
8891,149,1,30,ESTJ,11,"<Yes> It's not difficult for me to approach and strike up a conversation with someone I'm interested in. The reason is that if you have the same interests, it is easy to have a conversation and the words flow well."
8892,149,1,30,ESTJ,12,<Yes>  I'm not interested. The reason is that I don't always like going to see art.
8893,149,1,30,ESTJ,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. The reason is that I have made emotional judgments and have been greatly disappointed, so I tend to follow them rationally."
8894,149,1,30,ESTJ,14,"<Yes>  I improvise. The reason is that I don't like to plan very much because I live a busy life and I don't have time to do that, and I suddenly have free time."
8895,149,1,30,ESTJ,15,<no>  I tend not to worry. The reason is that I don't care what other people think of me.
8896,149,1,30,ESTJ,16,"<neutrality>  am neutral. The reason is that there are not that many opportunities to participate in group activities, and if there is an opportunity to participate, I do it and do not do it."
8897,149,1,30,ESTJ,17,<no>  I'm not. The reason is that I don't like to read books and movies.
8898,149,1,30,ESTJ,18,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is that if I help and succeed, my heart will be proud."
8899,149,1,30,ESTJ,19,<neutrality>  I am neutral. Because sometimes you have a lot of interest and sometimes you don't.
8900,149,1,30,ESTJ,20,<no> I'm not. The reason is that I tend not to think that things will go wrong.
8901,149,1,30,ESTJ,21,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is, if other people want me to lead, there's no reason to avoid it."
8902,149,1,30,ESTJ,22,<Yes>  I am. The reason is that I do not have an artistic inclination because I do not have an emotional and rational inclination.
8903,149,1,30,ESTJ,23,<no> I'm not. The reason is because I never thought that the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion.
8904,149,1,30,ESTJ,24,<Yes>  I am. The reason is that you can rest in peace only when you finish all your work and rest.
8905,149,1,30,ESTJ,25,<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that sometimes it's fun when other people argue and sometimes it's not.
8906,149,1,30,ESTJ,26,<Yes>  I am. The reason is that I don't like it when other people pay attention to me.
8907,149,1,30,ESTJ,27,<Yes>  I am. The reason is that there are often times when I suddenly feel good without even realizing it and then just get angry.
8908,149,1,30,ESTJ,28,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is that people's personalities and ways of working are all different, so I'm not annoyed by that."
8909,149,1,30,ESTJ,29,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is that if you put off what you have to do, there will be more work to do next, so you must finish the work unconditionally."
8910,149,1,30,ESTJ,30,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is that I've never been asked such a question, but I'm not interested even if I hear it."
8911,149,1,30,ESTJ,31,"<Yes>  I want to spend time with other people. The reason is that I spend a lot of time alone, so I want to spend it with my friends."
8912,149,1,30,ESTJ,32,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is that I am not very interested in theory-centered discussions and principled stories, and I do not like to talk about them."
8913,149,1,30,ESTJ,33,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is that I think that people's lives are all similar, so when someone from a different environment than me speaks, they can understand."
8914,149,1,30,ESTJ,34,<no>  I'm not. The reason is that I don't procrastinate because I feel comfortable when I have to make a decision.
8915,149,1,30,ESTJ,35,<Yes>  I tend not to rethink decisions I have already made. The reason is because I don't want to regret the decision I made.
8916,149,1,30,ESTJ,36,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that there are weeks when we enjoy fun parties and events, so we judge by looking at the situation."
8917,149,1,30,ESTJ,37,<no>  I don't like it. The reason is that I don't like looking at art and going to art galleries.
8918,149,1,30,ESTJ,38,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is that I'm the type to recognize other people's expressions and actions, so it's not hard to understand their emotions."
8919,149,1,30,ESTJ,39,<no>  I'm not. The reason is that I don't like making plans because I prefer to do it right away rather than making plans every day.
8920,149,1,30,ESTJ,40,"<no>  I guess there are times when I feel a little insecure. The reason is that there is a natural tendency, but there are memories that the environment in which you grew up was not good."
8921,149,1,30,ESTJ,41,<no> I'm not. The reason is that I like talking on the phone with people rather than sending and receiving messages.
8922,149,1,30,ESTJ,42,<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is because I have never shared such an opinion in my life. I don't remember the experience very well.
8923,149,1,30,ESTJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to ask my friends to meet first. The reason is that I live in a foreign country, so I have to meet my friends when I have time, so I tend to contact them first."
8924,149,1,30,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is that if I don't go back quickly when there is a setback in my plan, I keep thinking about it, so I'm trying to go back as soon as possible."
8925,149,1,30,ESTJ,45,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is sometimes because of the actions I did when I was young, why did I do that then? I often think like that."
8926,149,1,30,ESTJ,46,<Yes>  tend not to think deeply. The reason is because humans are not curious about why they were born and lived.
8927,149,1,30,ESTJ,47,"<no>  I'm not. The reason is that when I am swayed by my emotions, it becomes difficult for me, so I tend to control my emotions."
8928,149,1,30,ESTJ,48,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that when many people are gathered looking at the situation, there are times when they try to save face even if they have done something wrong, and there are times when they are not."
8941,150,0,30,INTP,1,"<no>  I'm not good at making friends. The reason is that in order to be friends, you have to have a deep relationship, but it's not easy to do that."
8942,150,0,30,INTP,2,<Yes>  I am interested in many interests. Lately I've been very interested in history and mysteries. I am particularly interested in things like the American case.
8943,150,0,30,INTP,3,"<neutrality>  am different from person to person. If you are a person to take care of, you don't want to cry, and if you are a person who takes care of you, there are times when you do."
8944,150,0,30,INTP,4,"<Yes>  I tend to make several preparations. The reason is that there is not just one path, but many. Results are more important than process."
8945,150,0,30,INTP,5,"<Yes>  I usually keep my composure. I recently had a job interview, and I remember going through it well without being greatly shaken. I think it's probably because I've made several preparations."
8946,150,0,30,INTP,6,"<Yes>  I talk to someone I already know. The reason is that you can talk to someone new, but you don't want to talk to them."
8947,150,0,30,INTP,7,"<no>  do several projects at once. For example, I play PC games on my computer, play mobile games, and watch baseball on TV. Since my interests are diverse, there are times when I switch to other interests when I come up with a study that I have decided to do."
8948,150,0,30,INTP,8,<no>  I'm not sentimental. It's because I'm not very emotionally agitated. I also try to think as objectively and rationally as possible.
8949,150,0,30,INTP,9,<Yes>  like to make plans. Make a plan using a mobile phone application or using a memo. But it is not well maintained.
8950,150,0,30,INTP,10,"<no>  I don't doubt my abilities over small mistakes. If I make that mistake, others will too."
8951,150,0,30,INTP,11,"<Yes>  I find it difficult to approach and talk to people I am interested in. It usually takes time to approach the opposite sex you're interested in, and after that time, there are cases where the other person has already been paired up."
8952,150,0,30,INTP,12,"<Yes>  I am interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. The reason is because it is fun to know different points from various perspectives, rather than unifying something into one."
8953,150,0,30,INTP,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. This is because people around me usually talk to me to get a solution rather than to get empathy.
8954,150,0,30,INTP,14,"<Yes>  I like to improvise. Even when driving, you can go the way you always have been, but you can also go the way you want."
8955,150,0,30,INTP,15,"<neutrality>  Each situation is different for me. I tend to pay attention to people I care about, and I don't care about people I don't care about."
8956,150,0,30,INTP,16,<no>  enjoy working alone rather than working in a group. Because I don't like to be tied down to anything.
8957,150,0,30,INTP,17,"<Yes>  I like books and movies where you can interpret the ending in your own way. I like the movie 'La La Land' because it can be interpreted in many ways, such as interpretation from the perspective of love between a man and a woman and interpretation from the perspective of human growth."
8958,150,0,30,INTP,18,"<Yes>  I find greater satisfaction in helping others succeed. From before, my own success was important, but I was proud to see others around me grow through my help."
8959,150,0,30,INTP,19,"<no>  I have a lot of interests, but that doesn't mean I don't know what to do. Because you do what you want to do right now."
8960,150,0,30,INTP,20,<no>  don't often worry about things going wrong. I tend to judge the situation with optimism after light worries.
8961,150,0,30,INTP,21,<Yes>  I would like to avoid a leadership role in a group. This is because it takes a lot of energy to perfectly fulfill one's responsibilities and obligations as a leader.
8962,150,0,30,INTP,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. It's because I don't think I have any talent in arts and sports. In particular, the art side has no interest or ability."
8963,150,0,30,INTP,23,<no>  I think the world has developed because people have emotions. Because the world cannot be changed by being right.
8964,150,0,30,INTP,24,<no>  Rest is first for me. The reason is because I think everything will work out if I am comfortable first.
8965,150,0,30,INTP,25,"<Yes>  enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that by looking at other people's arguments, I can learn about things I didn't know. Of course, watching fights is fun."
8966,150,0,30,INTP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to try not to attract other people's attention. Basically, it's because I like quiet and casual situations."
8967,150,0,30,INTP,27,"<no> My emotions don't change or change very quickly. When I am reprimanded by someone, my mood fluctuates a few hours later rather than immediately."
8968,150,0,30,INTP,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed with people who aren't as effective as I am. I hate to spend my energy on useless things, but I tend to get very annoyed when I see co-workers doing things inefficiently."
8969,150,0,30,INTP,29,"<Yes>  often put things off until the end. Recently, I had to listen to an online lecture, but I had an experience of procrastinating and listening to it at the end of the lecture."
8970,150,0,30,INTP,30,"<Yes>  I am interested in questions about the afterlife. This is because it is a realm that no one can experience and talk about, but only talk about with imagination."
8971,150,0,30,INTP,31,"<no>  I prefer spending time alone rather than spending time with other people. It was like that in the past, and it is like that today."
8972,150,0,30,INTP,32,"<no>  I am interested in theory-based discussions. Because the most important thing in a discussion is facts. I've seen panels on TV before, where there's no theory, there's a lot of emotion and speculation, but it's hard to see."
8973,150,0,30,INTP,33,<no>  I don't easily empathize with people who are completely different from me. It's because I can't easily sympathize with the lives of chaebols or the thoughts of serial killers that I haven't experienced.
8974,150,0,30,INTP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone decisions until the very end. Even when choosing a meal menu, I make a list as much as possible and choose it by elimination method."
8975,150,0,30,INTP,35,"<no>  I tend to rethink decisions I have already made. Because if the decision is wrong, you have to think about the next best thing."
8976,150,0,30,INTP,36,"<no>  tend to relieve fatigue by spending time alone. Even today, watching Netflix alone at home is a daily routine."
8977,150,0,30,INTP,37,<no>  I don't like going to art galleries or looking at art. I think it's a waste of time.
8978,150,0,30,INTP,38,"<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. When I watch dramas or movies, I tend to empathize with the emotions of the characters."

8980,150,0,30,INTP,40,"<no>  Lately, I often feel anxious. The reason is still unknown, so he is receiving treatment."
8981,150,0,30,INTP,41,"<Yes>  would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that making a phone call itself is inconvenient. It's uncomfortable to talk to the other person, but it's even more uncomfortable to talk without seeing your face."
8982,150,0,30,INTP,42,"<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. Usually, I'm on the side of 'I guess so' and pass it on."
8983,150,0,30,INTP,43,<no>  I don't usually contact my friends to meet up first. I only do it when I absolutely have to.
8984,150,0,30,INTP,44,"<Yes>  If my plan is disrupted, I try to get back to it as quickly as possible. Recently, while studying, my girlfriend called and took up my time, but I was able to resume my studies with a quick persuasion."
8985,150,0,30,INTP,45,"<Yes>  I often regret mistakes made a long time ago. When a related situation arises, I tend to review it because I want to minimize mistakes as much as possible."
8986,150,0,30,INTP,46,<no>  I tend to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. Because that is the reason humans exist.
8987,150,0,30,INTP,47,"<no>  I'm better at controlling my emotions than being swayed by them. Even in my thoughts, my emotions are not very fluctuating, I am the type to rely on myself, who thinks and is not greatly agitated by those around me."
8988,150,0,30,INTP,48,"<no>  don't save face when the other person's fault is obvious. Because if you don't know right away what you did wrong, you will repeat the same mistakes."
9001,151,0,30,ENTP,1,<no>  You don't make new friends on a regular basis. You don't really need any new friends.

9003,151,0,30,ENTP,3,"<no> It doesn't make you want to cry just because someone else is crying. It's sad, but I don't think I'm going to cry."
9004,151,0,30,ENTP,4,<no>  They don't have multiple contingency plans in case things go wrong. Because things don't seem to go wrong.
9005,151,0,30,ENTP,5,"<Yes>  Remains composure even under heavy pressure. Even when my mother passed away recently, I resolved it rationally and with composure."
9006,151,0,30,ENTP,6,<Yes>  usually talk to people I already know. It's easier to talk to someone you know.
9007,151,0,30,ENTP,7,"<Yes>  I tend to complete one project before starting another. Even recently, when I had work, I focused only on that task, finished it, and started something else."
9008,151,0,30,ENTP,8,<neutrality>  It's neither positive nor negative about being sentimental. That's why I think it's neutral.
9009,151,0,30,ENTP,9,"<no>  I'm not good at planning. Since I don't make plans, I've never even written a diary."
9010,151,0,30,ENTP,10,"<no>  Everyone makes mistakes, so I don't doubt my ability or knowledge just because I made a mistake."
9011,151,0,30,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  It's easy to start a conversation with someone you're interested in, and the other person listens well."

9015,151,0,30,ENTP,15,"<Yes>  If I care about other people, I don't care because I'm unhappy and stressed out. There is no specific reason."
9016,151,0,30,ENTP,16,"<Yes>  When there is a group activity, most try to attend. Satisfaction with group activities is also high."
9017,151,0,30,ENTP,17,<no>  I like books and movies that have clear endings. I liked the recent movie Hansan because the ending and intention were clear.
9018,151,0,30,ENTP,18,"<no>  It's good for others to be good, but it's better for me to be good."
9019,151,0,30,ENTP,19,<no>  I have so many interests that I don't have so many interests that I don't know what to do next.
9020,151,0,30,ENTP,20,<no>  Worrying about it doesn't know if it will work out or not. There's no use worrying about it. That's what life has been like.
9021,151,0,30,ENTP,21,<Yes>  Taking on a leadership role in a group can be tiring and stressful. I like to be comfortable.
9022,151,0,30,ENTP,22,"<no> Very artistic inclination. Ever since I was little, I've been told I'm strange and unusual, and I think I'm special, different from others. I am still working on the performance side."
9023,151,0,30,ENTP,23,"<Yes>  Emotions are not unnecessary, but I believe that reason is much more important than emotions to make the world work right. Emotions are meant to help reason, not to be the main one. Because emotions are ambiguous about right and wrong."
9024,151,0,30,ENTP,24,"<no>  Rest is more important. You can do housework after taking a break, but doing housework when you are tired is stressful."
9025,151,0,30,ENTP,25,<no>  Arguing with others is no fun. It's not a big deal because it's not an argument I'm involved in.
9026,151,0,30,ENTP,26,<Yes>  Getting other people's attention is a lot of work and tiring. Better to stay still.
9027,151,0,30,ENTP,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. When it comes to the parts that I can't sympathize with, I tend to be calm."
9028,151,0,30,ENTP,28,"<no>  It's an efficient method no matter who sees it, but if it's not efficient, why would you want to do that, but I don't think it's annoying."
9029,151,0,30,ENTP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. Even recently, if there is a deadline, do it near the end."
9030,151,0,30,ENTP,30,"<Yes>  If a person's body dies and ends, this world will be like hell. There is expectation and hope that there is another world after death."
9031,151,0,30,ENTP,31,"<Yes>  There are many things you can do with others, and more fun than alone. Even today, I attend a lot of group activities."
9032,151,0,30,ENTP,32,"<Yes> It's no fun to keep saying the right thing. Recently, an acquaintance of mine asked for wisdom about human relationships. I kept giving the original answer, but it was boring and tiring to keep talking about this even though I knew it without saying it."
9033,151,0,30,ENTP,33,"<Yes>  I easily empathize with people who are completely different from me. I have a friend whose background is completely different from mine, and we communicate well without hesitation."
9034,151,0,30,ENTP,34,"<no> When it comes to making decisions, it is easier to make them sooner than later. That's why we don't put off making decisions until the end."
9035,151,0,30,ENTP,35,<Yes>  You don't have to think twice about decisions you've already made. Because I have no regrets about the decision I made.
9036,151,0,30,ENTP,36,"<Yes>  It's more fun to be with others than alone and there are many things to do. These days, I gain strength by doing group activities."

9038,151,0,30,ENTP,38,"<no>  I understand other people's feelings. This is because I have never had an experience where I did not understand much when I had a conversation with the other person or when I felt ideas, thoughts, and emotions through any medium."
9039,151,0,30,ENTP,39,<no>  I'm not good at planning. I don't plan because making a plan doesn't mean it will go as planned.
9040,151,0,30,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  When I was young, I worried a lot about my family environment, but because worrying didn't solve the problem, I lived my life indifferently, so I hardly felt any anxiety. There seems to be a half innate tendency."
9041,151,0,30,ENTP,41,"<no>  There is no hesitation in making phone calls. Rather, they are more comfortable communicating via phone calls than texting."
9042,151,0,30,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  Not with everyone, but with loved ones. If you have a disagreement with your girlfriend, you talk for a very long time to understand."
9043,151,0,30,ENTP,43,<Yes>  Usually I contact my friends first and ask them to meet first.
9044,151,0,30,ENTP,44,"<no>  If our travel plans are disrupted, we will revise our plans on the fly and will not go back to our plans."
9045,151,0,30,ENTP,45,"<no>  I've thought about my mistakes long ago, but I don't regret it. Regret doesn't change anything, so I don't regret it."
9046,151,0,30,ENTP,46,<no>  Thinking about the reason we exist and live is one of the most important things we do as human beings.
9047,151,0,30,ENTP,47,"<no>  I think I'm better at controlling my emotions than being swayed by my own evaluation, as well as those around me."
9048,151,0,30,ENTP,48,"<Yes>  Even if it is clear that it is the other person's fault, I think saving the other person's face is the least consideration for the other person."
9061,152,1,20,ENTP,1,<Yes>  I tend to make new friends at various gatherings and current gatherings. It's fun to make friends and hear new facts and experiences.
9062,152,1,20,ENTP,2,"<Yes> Interests are diverse. Currently, I am interested in coding and game planning and spend a lot of time on finance."
9063,152,1,20,ENTP,3,"<neutrality>  It depends on the person. If you're very close to me and have a sympathy, you may cry, but most of them only have moderate empathy."
9064,152,1,20,ENTP,4,"<neutrality>  When it comes to work, I tend to work with a number of preparations in place. But I don't make preparations for play or rest time."
9065,152,1,20,ENTP,5,"<no>  When something unexpected happens, I tend to panic. But even in the midst of panic, I find a breakthrough. I recently got a job at a company, and I was taken aback by the sudden order for my new job, but I solved everything in the meantime."
9066,152,1,20,ENTP,6,"<no>  I introduce myself to new people first. For me, the purpose of parties and events is to meet new people."
9067,152,1,20,ENTP,7,"<no>  I tend to do a lot of work and pay it back with responsibility. It's because the desire to do it comes and goes out at once. This time, I am having trouble applying for a side job too many times and getting accepted."
9068,152,1,20,ENTP,8,"<no>  I am indifferent to people and sentimental to nature. I'm not very inspired by what people say, but when I watch the sunset, I tend to get emotional."
9069,152,1,20,ENTP,9,"<Yes>  I like to make plans for the next day. However, it is not repeated every day, but only on important or necessary days."
9070,152,1,20,ENTP,10,<no>  I don't question my ability or knowledge because I think small mistakes can be corrected.
9071,152,1,20,ENTP,11,"<no>  I tend to start a conversation first, focusing on the characteristics or interests of the person I am interested in. That's how I met company shooters and university friends."
9072,152,1,20,ENTP,12,"<no>  I am interested in sharing and discussing interpretations of works of art. Art is a study with various perspectives, so I feel pleasure in exploring those areas."
9073,152,1,20,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow emotions rather than reason. However, people around me evaluate me as following the opposite sex."
9074,152,1,20,ENTP,14,"<neutrality> There are days when planning is fun and days when improvisation is fun. When I'm working, I enjoy planning, and when I'm playing, I enjoy being spontaneous."
9075,152,1,20,ENTP,15,"<no>  I worry and worry a lot. I think worrying about what kind of person I will appear to others helps me create a good image and control my mind, so I'm thinking about it."
9076,152,1,20,ENTP,16,"<Yes>  enjoy the activities of my favorite group a lot. These days, I just joined the company, and I tend to hang out with people at the company, and I met 2-3 meetings regularly during my college days."
9077,152,1,20,ENTP,17,"<no>  I like books and movies that have an ending. Unlike art, I like to simply enjoy the medium or media as snack culture. That's why I like the movie 'Extreme Job'."
9078,152,1,20,ENTP,18,<no>  I put my success first. It's because I think that I can afford to help others when I have to do well.
9079,152,1,20,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  I have so many things I want to do. Recently, I don't know what to do with various interests such as coding and writing web novels."
9080,152,1,20,ENTP,20,"<no>  I'm not the type to worry. I worry about things going wrong, but I don't worry because I think about what I have to do. Because worrying doesn't make things better."
9081,152,1,20,ENTP,21,<no>  also enjoy taking on the leadership role of an organization. I want to become a person who is recognized if I work hard.
9082,152,1,20,ENTP,22,"<no>  There is no artistic inclination. I haven't studied art, but I can look at the work and give my personal interpretation."
9083,152,1,20,ENTP,23,"<no>  think a society of reason will make the individual sick. First of all, I think it will be interpreted differently according to the standards of a better world. I think that rational thinking can improve society by increasing efficiency, but I believe that a society that values emotions is more necessary because I believe that humans without emotions are no different from machines."
9084,152,1,20,ENTP,24,"<no>  When I get home, I take a break. When I'm too tired, I don't want to do everything, and I mainly do housework."
9085,152,1,20,ENTP,25,"<no>  am anxious when I see an argument. I'm fine with the arguments I get involved in, but seeing other people arguing with each other is a little unsettling."
9086,152,1,20,ENTP,26,<no>  I like people's attention. I get a little euphoria when people pay attention to me.
9087,152,1,20,ENTP,27,"<neutrality>  It depends. Things like heterosexual relationships change quickly, but other things don't change that much."
9088,152,1,20,ENTP,28,"<Yes> At the time of my part-time job, I changed my working hours because I was frustrated when I saw a successor who couldn¡¯t work properly."
9089,152,1,20,ENTP,29,"<Yes>  I often procrastinate doing things that I have to do. There are still a lot of things that are overdue, and I plan to do it once this is over."
9090,152,1,20,ENTP,30,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the person. It's interesting if the person is receptive, but boring if the person has already decided on an answer and doesn't listen to others."
9091,152,1,20,ENTP,31,"<neutrality> There are more times when I want to spend time with people, but sometimes I want to be alone."
9092,152,1,20,ENTP,32,"<no>  I think the most interesting story is the original story. Among humanities books, I tend to read a lot of fundamental books."
9093,152,1,20,ENTP,33,"<no>  It's over to the extent that it could be. I can listen to the person's story and show empathy, but I don't think I can empathize deeply."
9094,152,1,20,ENTP,34,"<no>  make decisions quickly, but I often change my mind. It's quick to choose an area when looking for rent, but it's also quick to change your mind."
9095,152,1,20,ENTP,35,<no>  I tend to reconsider when people around me give me opinions. Because I think there are better experts than me.
9096,152,1,20,ENTP,36,"<neutrality>  If you are tired from people that week, you tend to be alone, and if you are tired from work, you meet people. These days, I sleep because I am tired of both work and people."
9097,152,1,20,ENTP,37,"<Yes>  I like looking at art works in art galleries and reading the descriptions written on them. When you look at the work, it becomes calm healing."
9098,152,1,20,ENTP,38,"<no>  Understanding emotions is not difficult. It's easy to understand, but I just can't empathize."
9099,152,1,20,ENTP,39,"<neutrality>  enjoy planning things to do, but doing it every day is boring. If you plan for two days, it's more comfortable to have a day without plans. Work must be planned unconditionally, and personal work is mostly unplanned."
9100,152,1,20,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  Even if you feel anxious, you tend to recover quickly. Seeing that I have been like this since childhood, it seems like a natural tendency."
9101,152,1,20,ENTP,41,<no>  Calls are more convenient and better than texts or emails. Because you can spend less time on it.
9102,152,1,20,ENTP,42,"<neutrality>  If you have a different opinion on something that has nothing to do with me, I will admit that it is different and move on. However, in matters related to me, I try a lot to understand and understand."
9103,152,1,20,ENTP,43,"<Yes>  If you are hungry or if there is something you cannot eat by yourself, please contact us first."
9104,152,1,20,ENTP,44,"<no>  plan that has already gone awry is a ruined plan, so I don't try to go back and make another plan. Even if I can't do everything I planned for the day, I don't think I'm too stressed out."
9105,152,1,20,ENTP,45,<Yes>  I regret my mistakes a long time ago. I suffer from remembering the mistakes I made in the past that hurt people.
9106,152,1,20,ENTP,46,"<neutrality>  When I had time, I tended to think about it often, but now I don't have time, so I don't think about it."
9107,152,1,20,ENTP,47,<no> I've rarely been so swayed that I couldn't control my emotions. Say the same to those around you.
9108,152,1,20,ENTP,48,"<neutrality>  If that person did something serious, they don't save face, but if it's a person's cognitive fault, they save face."
9121,153,0,30,INFP,1,"<<neutral>  am neutral. The reason is that I went to many places to make new friends on purpose until I was in my twenties, but after my 30s, I was busy doing other things and having my own time, so I became very neglectful of making new friends both externally and mentally. Now, I'm living with the mindset that it doesn't matter if I get to know you by chance or not."
9122,153,0,30,INFP,2,"<Yes>  am very The reason is that you prefer to learn trivial magazine stuff, and since you're working in design, you're interested in new tools and techniques and writers using them. Also, I have been aware of movies, comics, and other subcultures in general for quite some time, and spend quite a bit of my free time consuming knowledge."
9123,153,0,30,INFP,3,"<Yes>  am very There are many reasons why people cry, but most of them are because they can't stand the emotions that rise from the heart. Even if I don't know why I'm crying right now, when I see it like that, there are often cases where my emotions assimilate without my knowledge, so if you know someone, stay with them until it stops, and if you don't know, I feel like the reason that made you cry is resolved quickly."
9124,153,0,30,INFP,4,"<Yes>  always do. The reason is that there are a lot of things to really measure before starting something, and it's because I'm the type of person who worries a lot about what might go wrong. Always have two or three contingency plans in place and at least one good reason to finish off the road without a hitch. If this doesn't work, make sure to spend more time doing it, or don't touch it at all."
9125,153,0,30,INFP,5,"<no>  tend to be very anxious. The reason is, as I wrote in item 4, I always plan all the big pictures in preparation for the perfect situation, but even so, severe pressure means that I am not completely sure of the work I am doing, even though I am in a situation where small improvisation is required. And at this time, as much as the shaking reed, the change in facial expression or gesture is revealed so severely that others immediately notice it. In particular, when I played a card game that required composure or a story about digging up the truth with my family and acquaintances, I was teased that I would never win, and I was teased that I could never do this kind of work or work. Even if I don't have to answer yes or no, I'm very weak in tasks that require agility without the big picture or confidence that I've drawn up so that I can figure out which side the other person is with just facial expressions and trembling gestures."
9126,153,0,30,INFP,6,"<neutrality>  am half and half. The reason is that a party or event is a place where you deliberately visit people to introduce yourself and meet people, so it is much less burdensome than introducing yourself in front of a lecture hall during school class. So, if a situation arises where I have to introduce myself first, I don't find it very difficult. Unless it is absolutely necessary, it is more familiar and comfortable to talk with close people or acquaintances, so I tend to act flexibly depending on the specific situation at a party or event."
9127,153,0,30,INFP,7,"<neutrality>  am different from time to time. The reason is that this one project I have in mind could be large and massive and take a lot of time, or it could be similar or small enough to be paralleled with other work. I am not satisfied with just one job and I have both my main job and a minor side job, but if this main job requires more than a month of working time, of course I have to complete this main job completely and have a side job in the remaining time. I don't necessarily finish one and start the next because I start on certain projects with a design in mind in advance so that I can work on them concurrently if the fields of my side hustle match and I can finish them all in a week if I'm both quick."
9128,153,0,30,INFP,8,"<Yes> I'm a bit sentimental. The reason is that since I was young, I tend to immerse myself in sad movies, dramas, or realistic situations more than others, and even as I grow older, this personality doesn't disappear, so I still tend to watch stories that touch people's heartstrings or videos of that genre, and music is the same. It's because I listen to songs like old city pop or jazz that deal with the romance of the days. Rather, the feeling of being immersed in this feeling is not bad, so I tend to immerse myself and search for it more."
9129,153,0,30,INFP,9,"<neutrality>  am a bit ambiguous. The reason is that I always draw up a big picture in case of uneasiness and have a plan to get out safely, but I think it's a kind of emergency exit, and it's a little different from a detailed schedule or list that fits in time. Of course, to record something, electronic tools such as an analog diary or a smartphone computer are always spread out on my desk, and they are essential items that I always carry in my pocket or bag when I go out. But that doesn't mean I don't like making plans with schedules and lists. I think it's very cumbersome and annoying to write down the list and act on time, so I don't like to tell you either way."
9130,153,0,30,INFP,10,"<Yes>  tend to shake a lot even with small mistakes. The reason is that since I was very young, I was compared to my siblings and abilities a lot by my parents in this way because of my innate sentimental personality, and especially only to me, because you lacked a lot, I was pressured not that your future life would be smooth if you worked harder to find your way to live. because of. The habit of not being able to measure too much or even start if I can't see an inch right now has been continued in this way. I live with an inferiority complex."
9131,153,0,30,INFP,11,"<neutrality> Depending on the situation, I find it difficult and easy. The reason is that in a noisy place like a party or event, where people around you are distracted, there is a strong atmosphere to do so on purpose. However, it becomes very difficult to approach and talk to them first if they are in a tight group or in a quiet and specific place where attention is focused even if you talk even a little."
9132,153,0,30,INFP,12,"<no>  I'm rather very interested. The reason is that people who are interested in visual media or subculture, like me, enjoy sharing information and discussing the interpretation of the work or the hidden story as an extension of that. It is because, in the first place, a work of art itself has many stories implied in it, so it is impossible to leave it out."
9133,153,0,30,INFP,13,"<neutrality> It depends. The reason is that I always try to stay calm when something happens to me, and I tend to make rational decisions considering the situation and the position of the people around me as much as possible. It's because I often get shaken by pressure or weak mentality, so sometimes I get emotionally angry or restless without even realizing it. People around you, including your family, say that sometimes you become more cold-hearted than others, and sometimes you are too emotional like an immature child."
9134,153,0,30,INFP,14,"<Yes>  am very The reason for this is that, for me, planning is not about making detailed schedules according to time, but about preparing for big obstacles and stumbling blocks in advance. It is also because I think that as long as I can enjoy what I want to do as I go, that is enough. In my experience, rather than sticking to an unwanted schedule, enjoying what I want to do to my heart's content within my ability increases my work efficiency and synergy with my surroundings is not bad."
9135,153,0,30,INFP,15,"<no>  am always worried. The reason is that I have a stronger sense of inferiority in comparison than others, and I always live thinking that people should have at least one strength above average, so if there is a point that is deducted from other people's evaluation, it will be the absence of some qualities or abilities I have. This is because I am most concerned about the judgment of others. Up until now, I've been living my life almost half-forcedly acting as a polite and nice person to make up for what I lack in my life, so I've heard that my personality is really good, but I realized in various situations that if it ended with just this sentence, it would not be a compliment at all. After that, I developed my ability to do what I couldn't do, and if I'm worried about other people's evaluation anyway, I just worry to my heart's content now, but one day I have a mindset to work harder to fill that part."
9136,153,0,30,INFP,16,"<no>  prefer individual activities alone rather than group activities. The reason is that each person's behavior is different and I don't know where it will bounce, so I often have to quickly change the contingency plans I've thought of and prepared, and the activity of synchronizing with someone else requires a lot of instantaneous improvisation, so it's more difficult for me. because it wins As in the past, these days, I do not participate in ball games or other group activities outside at all, and even games that require cooperation have not been touched at all since I had severe friction with my friends a long time ago. I'd rather go through the build-up alone, it's much easier to clear, and it's more rewarding to do it yourself, so it's more suitable."
9137,153,0,30,INFP,17,"<Yes> Watching books and movies with different interpretations of the ending is one of the pleasures of my life. The reason is that most of the people who like subculture culture, where the story is the most important, have their own world clear and go beyond a set ending and take pleasure in life to rapidly reveal their own ideal interpretation. Although it is a film that has received mixed reviews lately, I watched Rang Jong, a collaboration between director Na Hong-jin and Thai director Ban Jong, very interestingly at the theater."
9138,153,0,30,INFP,18,"<no>  used to think I was that kind of person. The reason is that I played a kind person and a polite person to fill my lacking side with human nature, and I was so immersed in it that I was mistaken for helping others succeed and happiness rather than myself. As for my future career, I thought about teaching or welfare to lead others, but now that I know that I have a better nose than others, I think it will be no problem to help others as long as I succeed first and have enough time to be satisfied."
9139,153,0,30,INFP,19,"<no>  I know now. The reason is that there were a lot of things I wanted to do until recently, but there were many cases where I couldn't even try because I was clinging to my talent or aptitude. Now that I know what to do as my main job and what I should do as a hobby to be less painful, I am only thinking about how to do this job more quickly and effectively."
9140,153,0,30,INFP,20,"<Yes>  I'm always worried. The reason is that I had a lot of experiences in my childhood when I was often criticized rather than persecuted and criticized compared to other brothers and sisters, and it was also because of my mistakes in the past when I tried to fill my lacking ability with a human being. That's why I always create a big picture and at least one reason to finish midway through work before I start working."
9141,153,0,30,INFP,21,"<Yes>  Even if you give me a lot of money, I will decline. The reason is not only that I don't prefer a group life that requires momentary improvisation while working with someone, but also because being the leader of a group comes with great responsibility. As much as I enjoy power, there are certain things that I have to bear as a duty, so I want to avoid becoming the head of a group as much as possible, even if I give a billion dollars in my capacity."
9142,153,0,30,INFP,22,"<neutrality> It's half and half. The reason is that if I had judged that I really had no artistic inclinations, I would not have started my career in design from scratch. Of course, appreciating art works and creating art pieces for yourself are definitely different areas, but it is impossible to even challenge the field of arts and sports, which require talent and aptitude, if you do not have the qualifications. I think I was able to make this a career with very little artistic inclination and some effort to bridge the gap with others."
9143,153,0,30,INFP,23,"<no>  think both emotion and reason have distinct roles. The reason is that if reason is more important than emotion in all situations, it will literally be a world without emotions like robots, and if emotions go far ahead, emotions can be a major stumbling block in areas where calm decisions are needed. Just as hot summer and cold winter must alternate at each time for all living things to survive, a world that values only one side more than the other is biased and cannot be called a better world."
9144,153,0,30,INFP,24,"<Yes>  am. The reason is because to me, rest is not sitting, but lying down with your head on the floor. In other words, once you lie down like that, it is very difficult and annoying to get up again. Just as brushing your teeth before going to bed is a good idea, if you finish the housework or things you need to organize before going to bed, you will not be bothered anymore and you will not have to worry about the small things that you have thought about beforehand. After the break, there is no need to fret about the future. I think it's because of the routine and efficiency that I have, rather than the feeling."
9145,153,0,30,INFP,25,"<no>  I hate it. The reason is that I hate confrontation with someone creating a nasty atmosphere in front of me. Sharing various opinions about the ending of a work is a discussion, and an argument goes beyond that and is a realm of a fight to see who is right."
9146,153,0,30,INFP,26,"<Yes> Dark Templar. The reason is that I try not to stand out in public and private, and it is very burdensome to be in the spotlight. Likewise on the Internet, even commenting on a post or chatting is very careful about whether other users will notice it, and I rarely do it. ."
9147,153,0,30,INFP,27,"<Yes> There are really big emotional changes. The reason is, for example, that I made a mistake while working on something and in a very bad mood to the point of cursing, drinking coffee to change my mood and watching a funny video, I forgot the situation just before and today is a pleasant day without any major problems. You will feel it. Then, when I suddenly see a sad video, I feel depressed to the point of tears in an instant, and my mood subsides. This is a brief expression of the emotions of a recent day and applies equally to real-life conversations and situations."
9148,153,0,30,INFP,28,"<no>  think it depends on the person. The reason is that I often get pointed out by others about the efficiency I have prepared in my own way. As a result, there is no problem, and depending on my condition or ability, there are times when I need more time or work again, but since this is a matter of competence, I think there is an efficient method that suits each person. In a way, I think it is very arrogant to say that there is no need to be annoyed and that you are as efficient as yourself."
9149,153,0,30,INFP,29,"<neutrality>  have different reasons than before and now. The reason is that in the past, if you put off a certain task, you prioritized rest over important work that you had to do right away, so you simply stayed late like a student who didn't do your homework while eating and playing. I often need to recharge for a while because it is too difficult beyond my capabilities and I need more time to think, or I can't get it right away for other reasons. Of course, if you can do something right now, be sure to finish it and take a break."
9150,153,0,30,INFP,30,"<Yes>  It's very interesting. The reason is that the afterlife, which no one has ever been to and has yet to experience, is a very inexhaustible and appropriate regular material in the field of work that requires individual interpretation and opinions. As it is a world after death, it is not awkward to fit into the main horror genre or other parts, and there is no special historical evidence even if you interpret it as you like, so it is a very suitable question as a topic for discussion."
9151,153,0,30,INFP,31,"<no>  am comfortable alone. The reason is that I don't like group life and it's much more comfortable to spend time thinking about things by myself. Due to my personality, being with someone is a very cumbersome task for me because I have to take care of not only my condition but also the existence of others. These days, that feeling is stronger than before, so I tend to do everything by myself without making any contact other than necessary."
9152,153,0,30,INFP,32,"<no> All stories and discussions are interesting. The reason is that it is very healthy and enjoyable to share various interpretations and opinions on a single topic, unless it is an argument that is the realm of fighting. In particular, subculture culture, which is my interest, has one work, shows each other's own colors, and exposes various creations to people. I think it is very interesting and interesting because it is an art and the end of the theoretical fun."
9153,153,0,30,INFP,33,"<neutrality> It will vary from case to case. The reason is that simply because the background is different, it cannot be said that there are no points that can be easily sympathized with. For example, when you meet a foreigner from far away from Kenya from the other side of the world, of course, there are clear differences in the way you live and the language and culture in a big way, but living together, you can find food that suits each other, or something you can enjoy equally. can. It may be the same as a trivial philosophical side that you have in your heart, so there will be no cases where the consensus is different. Even though the country and race are different, in the end, the essence is the same person, so I think there are many points that can be easily sympathized with if the area of empathy is set broadly."
9154,153,0,30,INFP,34,"<neutrality> This is different from question 29. The reason is that in the past, like a student who really procrastinated homework, if I put it off without much thought because it was easy to decide later, there is no problem. It is often the case that after hesitating for a long time, it is postponed until the end. Of course, if I don't have to delay a decision, I tend to make it right away without hesitation."
9155,153,0,30,INFP,35,"<Yes>  won't look back. If it's a decision I've made, it's a conclusion I've come to after much deliberation, and I consider regretting what I've already done a failure, so if a problem arises with a decision I've already made, I'll take responsibility for myself and won't change it again."
9156,153,0,30,INFP,36,"<no> There are no fun parties and events. The reason is that I prefer to spend time alone, contemplating in a quiet place, rather than in a noisy and noisy place or event. Unless it's a place to discuss or share opinions about a particular work, I'm getting more and more time to relieve stress and fatigue by myself these days."
9157,153,0,30,INFP,37,"<Yes> It's one of my favorite places. The reason is that appreciating all the art works and subcultures of the world is my hobby and life's pleasure, and the museum is a place where all the works of art are gathered together. I like going to art galleries to the extent that if I go periodically and look at various works on my days off or when I have spare time, that alone makes the day worthwhile."
9158,153,0,30,INFP,38,"<Yes> Very many. The reason is that understanding each other's feelings is more difficult than looking into the water ten ways, not just me, but like everyone else in the world. It is because it is difficult to understand each other's feelings and they do not want to acknowledge each other's feelings. I've always been like that with anyone, and as I get older, I'd rather just leave it alone and live without touching each other as I want to, rather than forcibly understanding the feelings of others I don't understand."
9159,153,0,30,INFP,39,"<neutrality>  I don't like it and I think it's necessary. The reason is that there are always many variables in the daily routine, including both work and personal matters, and there may be situations where you have to step back in a hurry. no see."
9160,153,0,30,INFP,40,"<no>  am insecure by nature. The reason is that since I was young, I had already had such anxiety, so I often had nightmares or urinated at night, and I had a difficult time mentally going to the hospital often. There is no special reason, and it is assumed that it is an innate tendency. Even now, in order to overcome this anxiety, I have developed a habit of always making big plans and making several preparations in advance when it comes to important work."
9161,153,0,30,INFP,41,"<Yes>  prefer text chat rather than phone. The reason is that, unlike chatting or written conversations, where you can think through and express your opinion, a phone call requires immediate feedback as it is an act of exchanging voices in real time. Since a person's voice reveals all of the emotions the other person is having, it is more intuitive than writing, where you can control your emotions depending on the way you write them, so I want to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible."
9162,153,0,30,INFP,42,"<no>  think it's a waste of time. The reason is because I think the most difficult and reckless thing in the world is to look into the hearts of others and give feedback. If you have a very different opinion from yourself, going your separate ways is the best way to spend less energy on each other and get along harmoniously. There was also a time when I tried to convince others unreasonably and failed, and I couldn't sleep at night because of resentment. Using that experience as a stepping stone, I realized that it is more efficient to change myself than others, and I live more comfortably than before."
9163,153,0,30,INFP,43,"<no>  In most cases, a friend contacted them first. The reason is that I don't like contacting someone on purpose, so until recently, when there was a movie or event worth watching, a friend contacted me first to set up a schedule, and I usually agreed, but these days, when we've lost contact with each other, there's no such thing anymore."
9164,153,0,30,INFP,44,"<neutrality>  It depends. The reason is that the plans I make are not detailed schedules, but mostly just preparations to avoid two or three big obstacles, so when a setback occurs, if I can make up for it right away, I will try to quickly return to the starting point, but most of them stop what I am doing for a while and start again. I tend to start reworking only after painting."
9165,153,0,30,INFP,45,"<Yes>  Especially a lot in childhood. The reason is because it was a time when I was more immature and less thinking than now. Even with the current value that regretting is a failure, sometimes I often pull up the covers at night because I remember the days when I was wearing a school uniform and the dark history I committed when I was in my early twenties."
9166,153,0,30,INFP,46,"<no>  I am always thinking. The reason is that like the topic of the afterlife, where humans came from and why they live is a very interesting philosophical topic. I believe that the more deeply we gain insight into our human beings and our lives, the deeper and wiser our values will be for our future lives."
9167,153,0,30,INFP,47,"<Yes>  I tend to wield it like a whip. The reason is that I am still very immature about the act of judging rationally and controlling emotions effectively. Just like my innate insecurity and the evaluation of people around me, I have the hardest time maintaining a poker face, so when I am subjected to external or internal pressure, it is easily revealed and I tend to be attracted to my personal feelings."
9168,153,0,30,INFP,48,"<neutrality> Depends on my feelings. The reason is that the position I take toward the other person changes as much as I am easily led by my emotions. When the atmosphere is good and I don't have any feelings for the other person, I try to pass it on quietly or split it in half, saying that I did something wrong, but on the other hand, if the other person offended me, say it's your fault straight up and crumple it like tissue paper that has run out of face. will strive for"
9181,154,0,40,ENFJ,1,"<Yes>  In my opinion, the society and field to which people belong are different, and the more friends they make, the more they can build knowledge in that field."
9182,154,0,40,ENFJ,2,"<neutrality>  I don't spend much time on it, but my recent interest is running servers based on Linux."
9183,154,0,40,ENFJ,3,<Yes>  I get sad when people cry. I guess it's because I'm full of emotions.
9184,154,0,40,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  I always have a second contingency plan ready. The reason is because if things go wrong and you can't proceed, the time you've been working on and preparing so far becomes meaningless."
9185,154,0,40,ENFJ,5,"<Yes>  I maintain my composure even under a lot of pressure. When my maternal grandparents died recently, I calmly welcomed the mourners at the funeral home."
9186,154,0,40,ENFJ,6,<no>  I like meeting new people. The reason is because I like to hear the stories of people who are living a life I don't know.
9187,154,0,40,ENFJ,7,<Yes>  only do one project at a time. The reason is that you have to focus entirely on one thing and complete it to be satisfied with yourself.
9188,154,0,40,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I am moderately sentimental. The reason is that you can assimilate other people's feelings, but you don't express them intensely."
9189,154,0,40,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  I like to make plans. Making a WBS plan is fun, even for the little things."
9190,154,0,40,ENFJ,10,"<neutrality>  believe that humans can make mistakes. Recently, I went outside wearing different socks."
9191,154,0,40,ENFJ,11,"<Yes>  I express my feelings clearly to the person I like. It depended on the opponent, but most people liked it."
9192,154,0,40,ENFJ,12,<no>  I am interested in different interpretations of works of art. This is because people do not all have the same mind because their growth process is different and their thoughts are different.
9193,154,0,40,ENFJ,13,"<no>  I mostly follow my emotions. But when you're angry, you focus more on the opposite sex. Most of the surroundings are like that."
9194,154,0,40,ENFJ,14,"<no>  I start my day by setting most of my schedule for the day. On your days off, make a rough plan so that you can follow through on what you have to do."
9195,154,0,40,ENFJ,15,"<no>  want to be seen as a good person by others. In my social life, there are times when I think that if there is a person with good manners, I want to be like him."
9196,154,0,40,ENFJ,16,"<Yes>  I participate in group activities. These days, I am volunteering at an abandoned dog shelter."
9197,154,0,40,ENFJ,17,<Yes>  I like stories with open endings. I like the movie Gokseong because it's not clear until the end who the characters are good or evil.
9198,154,0,40,ENFJ,18,"<Yes>  find satisfaction in helping others succeed. Because, in the end, they are all headed towards the same goal."
9199,154,0,40,ENFJ,19,"<Yes>  I have many interests. Because a job is a job, you have to create something new through new experiences."
9200,154,0,40,ENFJ,20,<no>  I believe that a perfect plan always produces good results. It's because you can live a life without regrets if you plan your life well.
9201,154,0,40,ENFJ,21,<no>  I think the role of a leader is to have a good understanding of what you do and the characteristics of people. I enjoy getting to know new things and people.
9202,154,0,40,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. Art isn't art only if it's artistic, but I think it's artistic if you're skilled in each field."

9242,155,1,20,ESTJ,2,"<neutrality>  like to explore various interests, but I don't invest much time in exploring because I need a lot of time to do the things I've been given. Recently, I am interested in 3D Vision and am reading a paper."
9243,155,1,20,ESTJ,3,"<neutrality>  If someone else is crying, I want to cry with them, but rather than crying with them, I tend to figure out why the other person is crying and offer comfort or advice."

9246,155,1,20,ESTJ,6,<no>  I enjoy introducing myself to new people and talking to them. This is because there are many people with different values in the world.
9247,155,1,20,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  Usually one project is completely finished before a new one is started. Recently, I stopped studying algorithms to focus on studying for graduate school."
9248,155,1,20,ESTJ,8,"<neutrality>  I like emotions, but I'm not very sentimental. I enjoy beautiful scenery, but I tend to take pictures and record rather than enjoy the scenery itself, and I am curious about how the scenery occurred."

9268,155,1,20,ESTJ,28,"<no>  I tend to value efficiency, so I get annoyed when I see people who are very inefficient, but I don't get annoyed at people who aren't as efficient as I am. Rather, I tend to think about ways to increase efficiency by helping that person."

9287,155,1,20,ESTJ,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions rationally according to the situation without being swayed by my emotions, and the evaluations of my surroundings are similar to this."
9288,155,1,20,ESTJ,48,"<no>  I think defending the other person's mistakes in order to save face is rather poisonous to that person, so I tend to give advice so that I can correct my mistakes rather than trying to save face."
9301,156,0,40,INFP,1,"<no>  I don't go out of my way to make friends voluntarily, other than meeting new people, such as for work. It's because it's burdensome to know too many people."

9304,156,0,40,INFP,4,"<neutrality>  It depends on what's going on, but if it's important, we'll take some countermeasures. If not, it is often treated as an improvisation. The reason seems to be due to his personality being a bit lazy."

9312,156,0,40,INFP,12,<no>  I am very interested in reading and talking about books and movies. I like to talk about things because each person has different thoughts about a piece of art.
9313,156,0,40,INFP,13,"<neutrality> It seems to depend on the situation. It seems to be rational when it comes to work, and it seems that there are times when it is emotional when it is between personal people. You seem to feel the same way around you."

9315,156,0,40,INFP,15,"<no>  tend to worry about how I look to others. Because of my slightly perfectionist tendency, I worry about how people will look at me if I make a mistake, so I don't speak well, and that seems to have influenced the formation of my personality since I was a child."
9316,156,0,40,INFP,16,"<neutrality>  I don't usually participate in group activities, but when I do participate, I like it and enjoy it. These days, there is coronado, so I'm not doing group activities."
9317,156,0,40,INFP,17,"<neutrality> It depends on the work, but sometimes it's good to have a perfect ending, and sometimes it's good to give people something to think about. <The Wailing"

9319,156,0,40,INFP,19,"<Yes>  There are so many interests that it seems that there are times when you can't decide what to do next. I'm currently looking for another job after leaving the company, but I can't decide because there are so many things I want to do."
9320,156,0,40,INFP,20,"<Yes>  I am often worried that things will go wrong. It seems that he is timid and lacks self-confidence, so when he does something, he doesn't seem to be able to go through it boldly."
9321,156,0,40,INFP,21,<Yes>  I want to avoid leadership roles. It's because it doesn't fit my personality of being afraid to step out.
9322,156,0,40,INFP,22,"<neutrality>  don't think there is any artistic inclination. When I was young, I was interested in drawing and I loved it. I like books, and I also like art films that others say are boring."
9323,156,0,40,INFP,23,"<no>  Emotion and reason are both human characteristics, so I don't think the world would have been a better place by focusing only on reason. Rather, it seems that it has become a more desolate and dry world."
9324,156,0,40,INFP,24,"<neutrality> It seems half and half. Rest is the first thing to do when you are tired and tired, but when you finish your work and rest, you feel so much satisfaction, so you do housework first."
9325,156,0,40,INFP,25,"<Yes>  It's fun to watch other people's arguments. People's opinions vary, so it's fun to hear them."

9327,156,0,40,INFP,27,"<neutrality>  This is not usually the case, but when there is an external trigger, emotions change quickly. There are times when a high-tension friend cheers you up or plays a fun game."
9328,156,0,40,INFP,28,"<neutrality>  I get annoyed when I see people who are not effective. But if you don't know, I think it might be and let you know well."
9329,156,0,40,INFP,29,"<neutrality> When I was in school, I used to do a lot of studying for exams. However, it seems to have improved little by little as I went about my social life."
9330,156,0,40,INFP,30,<Yes>  I think the question of the afterlife is interesting. It is a very interesting field because the living people are an unknown world that no one knows about and different opinions are divided.
9331,156,0,40,INFP,31,"<neutrality> There are times when you want to be alone and there are times when you want to spend time with other people. These days, I don't go out because of Corona, so I want to meet my friends."

9341,156,0,40,INFP,41,"<Yes>  I want to avoid talking on the phone. When I was young, I had phone phobia, so I was often startled by the ringing of the phone and couldn't speak well because I was nervous during the call."
9342,156,0,40,INFP,42,"<Yes>  I tend to try to understand other opinions. At first, I talk about my thoughts and persuade them, but when the difference of opinion continues and conflicts arise, I take time and try to understand them."
9343,156,0,40,INFP,43,"<no>  I don't usually contact my friends to meet up first. There are times when I contact him rarely, but I am the one who is contacted most of the time."
9344,156,0,40,INFP,44,"<neutrality>  If there is a setback in the plan, at first I try to go back to the plan, but if it keeps going wrong, I tend to give up on myself. I made an exercise plan today, but if it rains, I could exercise in a different way, but there was a case where I just gave up."
9345,156,0,40,INFP,45,"<Yes>  Many times we regret the mistakes of a long time ago. These days, I wasted a lot of time, but I regret that I should have studied for a certification a long time ago."
9346,156,0,40,INFP,46,"<no>  I think a lot about the reason for human existence and life. These days, I have a lot of worries about my opaque future and feel depressed, so I think a lot about my existence and reason, philosophical and principled."
9347,156,0,40,INFP,47,"<neutrality>  I usually control my emotions, but sometimes I seem to be swayed by them. People around me seem to be looking at me a little emotionally."
9348,156,0,40,INFP,48,"<neutrality>  It seems to be a little different depending on the situation. There are times when I point out the other person's faults and talk strongly about them, and there are times when I comfort them by saying that it's okay and that it can be so."
9361,157,1,30,ISFP,1,<no>  don't tend to make new friends. The reason is that making new friends consumes a lot of emotional energy.
9362,157,1,30,ISFP,2,"<Yes>  I use my free time to explore various interests. These days, I am very interested in growing plants and decorating with plants."
9363,157,1,30,ISFP,3,"<neutrality>  I'm wrong sometimes I want to cry in a situation or a situation where I can sympathize, but I don't cry when I don't empathize."
9364,157,1,30,ISFP,4,"<no>  I don't make preparations. The reason is, I don't think it's meaningless to make preparations. I think it's right to act according to the time."
9365,157,1,30,ISFP,5,"<no>  I'm not good at keeping my composure. Even at a simple meal, I felt a lot of pressure from being in an uncomfortable seat, so I had an experience of sudden body weight when eating in an uncomfortable seat."
9366,157,1,30,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I tend to find and talk to people I already know and am close to. The reason is that it's hard to find a topic to talk to with a new person, and I hate gaps and awkwardness in the moment."
9367,157,1,30,ISFP,7,"<no>  I tend to work on several projects at the same time. There are times when I do two things at the same time when I am working on an assignment, and when I lose my concentration, I start another task."
9368,157,1,30,ISFP,8,"<no> I'm not sentimental. When I watch movies or dramas, I prefer horror stories or investigative dramas rather than sentimental ones."
9369,157,1,30,ISFP,9,"<no>  I hate making plans. My diary always has the first page written, and I like to go spontaneously without making travel plans."
9370,157,1,30,ISFP,10,"<no>  I do not doubt my ability or knowledge. When I receive feedback on a small mistake during work, I tend to find a solution rather than being suspicious."
9371,157,1,30,ISFP,11,<no>  I have a hard time starting a conversation. Most of them avoided it or met and talked with other close people.
9372,157,1,30,ISFP,12,<Yes>  I am not interested in discussing works of art. I am more interested in the interpretation of events where the results are perfect by analyzing rather than interpreting.
9373,157,1,30,ISFP,13,"<no>  tend to follow my emotions. When I make decisions, I decide what I want to do or what I need to buy, even though I know I could be wrong. It is said that you have to go through the evaluations of those around you and see the results yourself."
9374,157,1,30,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  I like to improvise rather than plan. When I go on a trip, I always try to come up with a plan, but planning is so difficult that I tend to improvise and do things I want to do."
9375,157,1,30,ISFP,15,"<Yes>  I like to improvise rather than plan. When I go on a trip, I always try to come up with a plan, but planning is so difficult that I tend to improvise and do things I want to do."
9376,157,1,30,ISFP,16,<no>  do not enjoy participating in group activities. There are situations in which I avoid when many other people gather at a regular meeting or when many people say they are going on a trip.
9377,157,1,30,ISFP,17,"<no>  I don't like works with open endings. When I look at mysteries, I think that works that end with an open ending without an accurate result or ending are somewhat futile, and these days, there are almost no works that I like because they have an open ending."
9378,157,1,30,ISFP,18,"<no>  feel more satisfaction with my successful work. I don't know if it's family to help others succeed, but I think in the future, no matter what happens, I will become a stranger."
9379,157,1,30,ISFP,19,"<Yes>  I have so many interests that I often run out of time. There are so many interests I want to do on my days off, so I start early in the morning, but in the end, there are many times when I can't do it."
9380,157,1,30,ISFP,20,"<Yes>  tend to worry often. Rather than having a trigger or reason, I like to quickly listen to the results and deal with the results when doing something."
9381,157,1,30,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  I want to avoid taking on a leadership role. When it comes to group activities, I don't like to stand out or stand out, and I don't want to take responsibility for my role as a leader."
9382,157,1,30,ISFP,22,<no>  I have a lot of artistic inclinations. I have had a lot of talent for making things since I was little and I like to learn artistically.
9383,157,1,30,ISFP,23,"<no>  I like that reason and emotion coexist. I think there are things that shouldn't be decided only rationally, and there are things that shouldn't be decided only emotionally."
9384,157,1,30,ISFP,24,"<no>  I want to take a break and do housework or do it whenever I feel like it. Rather than having to rest after finishing something, I tend to take a break and do housework quickly when I think of it."
9385,157,1,30,ISFP,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. There are times when you can get information by watching the debate, and it's nice to hear each person's thoughts."
9386,157,1,30,ISFP,26,<Yes>  I tend not to draw attention. I think that's how I stay quiet at group gatherings or dinners so as not to be seen quietly.
9387,157,1,30,ISFP,27,"<Yes> It tends to change very quickly. When I have a difficult task, I feel better when the problem is resolved or a solution is found."
9388,157,1,30,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I'm not efficient. When I work, I feel a lot of frustration when I see people who don't have a job or who don't have the same level of efficiency even if they do the same thing."
9389,157,1,30,ISFP,29,"<Yes>  Maru is on the side until the last deadline. I do a set quest every week, but there are always many times when I complete the quest on the last day."
9390,157,1,30,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  I like questions about the afterlife. It is very interesting to believe in the afterlife, to ask questions and answers about the afterlife, and to hear new stories."
9391,157,1,30,ISFP,31,"<neutrality>  Rather than spending time alone, I prefer to be with one or two people. Even these days, I get bored when I am alone, and there are many times when I do not know what to do when I am alone on my day off."
9392,157,1,30,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  I get bored with things I'm not interested in. When many people are talking, if they talk about something they are not interested in, there are many times when they think about something else as the content becomes longer."
9393,157,1,30,ISFP,33,"<no>  I'm not very good at empathy. I'm not good at empathizing with or understanding what people from different backgrounds or environments say, and I tend to feel a lot of differences in thinking."
9394,157,1,30,ISFP,34,<Yes>  I tend to put off making decisions until the last deadline. I tend to put off making decisions for as long as I can and then think about whether there are other workarounds or think about whether I made the right decision several times before deciding.
9395,157,1,30,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  I tend not to think twice about decisions. Because I don't know if it can be overturned again, but most of the time it's not, and there can only be regrets."
9396,157,1,30,ISFP,36,"<no>  I tend to spend time alone. Going to a party or event is also tiring, so I tend to watch YouTube at home alone or have interest in it."
9397,157,1,30,ISFP,37,<no>  I don't like art works or museums. Reasons need interpretation or don't like quiet empathy.
9398,157,1,30,ISFP,38,"<Yes> It is often difficult to understand emotions. For example, when an acquaintance has an accident, they tend to think of finding a solution rather than comforting and sympathizing with their feelings."
9399,157,1,30,ISFP,39,"<no>  I don't like planning. There are times when I set a simple goal, but there are many times when I don't know how to make a plan, make an appointment, or plan itself."
9400,157,1,30,ISFP,40,"<neutrality>  guess sometimes it's wrong. I feel insecure when I put it off until I put it off because of my innate tendency, and I don't feel it at all before that, and I don't think about it well."
9401,157,1,30,ISFP,41,<Yes>  I want to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible. It's because there are many times when I don't know what to say about what the other person on the phone is saying.
9402,157,1,30,ISFP,42,"<no>  I don't spend a lot of time trying to understand. I don't have a separate experience, and there are many times when I don't empathize well."
9403,157,1,30,ISFP,43,<no> I'm not the first to contact you. I'm not the type to wait for a call or to call first.
9404,157,1,30,ISFP,44,"<no>  I don't want to go back to the original plan. The other person misunderstood the time on the way to leave after making an appointment, and at times like that, there were times when I thought that it was possible and searched for what was around."
9405,157,1,30,ISFP,45,"<no> There is no time to regret. These days, I tend not to regret or think well. Thinking about it and regretting it doesn't change the result."
9406,157,1,30,ISFP,46,<Yes>  I don't have to think about the reason for human existence and life. I don't know why I should think about the reason for human existence and life.
9407,157,1,30,ISFP,47,"<neutrality> Controlling your emotions and being swayed by them is the middle ground. Depending on the situation, I can't control my emotions well when it comes to things I think are important, I tend to be swayed by my emotions when it comes to things I think are important or interests, and the evaluations of those around me are the same."
9408,157,1,30,ISFP,48,"<no>  I'm not trying to save face. The reason is that when the other person's fault happens, they think ""it could be that"" and try to understand it."
9421,158,0,30,ESTJ,1,"<no>  tend to think I have a lot of friends. So I don't feel the need. Also, I'm not the type to approach first."
9422,158,0,30,ESTJ,2,"<no>  I have various interests, but I don't do a lot of research. I get bored easily, so my interests change from time to time, so I don't dig deep. These days, I am very interested in baseball."
9423,158,0,30,ESTJ,3,"<no>  I am not easily swayed by or empathize with other people's feelings. Of course, when other people cry, I feel sorry for them, but I also don't shed tears because I'm empathized with them."
9424,158,0,30,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  I'm usually the type to move in a planned way. Therefore, we always keep in mind when something goes wrong and prepare for it so that there are no setbacks in our work."
9425,158,0,30,ESTJ,5,"<Yes>  I'm the type of person who doesn't care about the situation around me. I believe in being able to keep my composure and carry out my duties even under great pressure. I recently took on a new job, and it was a position I avoided, so there was a lot of pressure from people around me, but I did it without difficulty."
9426,158,0,30,ESTJ,6,<Yes>  I don't like change. That's why I'm not very good at approaching new people. But I don't push anyone who approaches me.
9427,158,0,30,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  I consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to work. So, if you don't finish one project perfectly, it's hard to jump into another one. So there is always a weakness in multiplayer."
9428,158,0,30,ESTJ,8,"<no>  I think too much empathy and emotional attitude go wrong. Therefore, we always try to make rational decisions and act accordingly."
9429,158,0,30,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  I like a planned life. So, I like to make plans. However, I don't like to use a diary or electronic tools, I just jot down my schedule on a calendar."
9430,158,0,30,ESTJ,10,"<Yes>  I always pursue perfection. So, I have a habit of checking several times, but if a mistake is found, I think I will doubt my ability. I haven't had that kind of experience yet."
9431,158,0,30,ESTJ,11,"<Yes>  It's difficult for me to approach new people first, but I think it's natural to approach people who are interested. Because the brave can win."
9432,158,0,30,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  I tend to respect people's different points of view. That's why I'm always curious about what other people think about what I think, and I like to talk with them."
9433,158,0,30,ESTJ,13,"<Yes>  I always try to think and act rationally because I think that emotions and sensibilities go wrong. Also, I hear a lot of such stories from people around me."
9434,158,0,30,ESTJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan and act. Therefore, I always make notes of my schedule and try to move according to the set plan."
9435,158,0,30,ESTJ,15,<no>  It doesn't matter what other people think of me. I just have to be proud of myself. I think I came to think that way because no one else is taking responsibility for my actions.
9436,158,0,30,ESTJ,16,"<Yes>  I like sports activities. Especially in team ball games such as basketball, soccer, and baseball. So, I do a lot of club activities."
9437,158,0,30,ESTJ,17,"<no>  I respect various opinions, but I think it's better for the creator to come to a conclusion rather than the reader to draw a conclusion when it comes to books and movies. That's why I like movies based on true stories."
9438,158,0,30,ESTJ,18,"<Yes>  I don't think I need to shine. And I think it's okay for me to be satisfied with my actions and performance, not people's eyes. I think this tendency is reflected."
9439,158,0,30,ESTJ,19,"<no>  I have a variety of interests, but I always like to make plans and move, so I don't think there's ever been a time when I don't know what to do next."
9440,158,0,30,ESTJ,20,"<Yes>  I like perfection, so I always check and review often. I think it's because the field I majored in is a field that emphasizes reliability and transparency."
9441,158,0,30,ESTJ,21,"<no>  If the group needs me, I don't want to avoid it. Because someone has to do it."
9442,158,0,30,ESTJ,22,"<Yes>  think I have little artistic inclination because I always try to think and act rationally rather than sensibility and emotion. Even during my school days, I always performed poorly in arts subjects."
9443,158,0,30,ESTJ,23,"<Yes>  I wish people would value reason more than emotion. In particular, it would be nice if reason was given importance in voting for politicians."
9444,158,0,30,ESTJ,24,"<Yes>  feel uncomfortable when I have work left. So, before I take a break, I tend to finish all my work. I think this is probably because of the personality that pursues perfection."
9445,158,0,30,ESTJ,25,<Yes>  There are various people in the world and I think everyone has different thoughts. So I like to argue. I believe that I can develop further only when I can sympathize with and understand the thoughts of many people.
9446,158,0,30,ESTJ,26,<Yes>  don't want to be noticed by people because I think it's okay if I'm confident in my actions and have no shame.
9447,158,0,30,ESTJ,27,"<no>  I always try to think and act rationally, so my emotions don't change much."
9448,158,0,30,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  I like things that are planned and perfect, so I always try to do things efficiently. Of course, I get annoyed when I see people who are different from me. However, I tend to refrain from expressing myself."
9449,158,0,30,ESTJ,29,"<no>  I don't feel comfortable even if I rest if I have work to do. So, I have never put off until the end what I have to do."
9450,158,0,30,ESTJ,30,"<Yes>  The afterlife is interesting because no one is clear about the answer. Death is scary, but I'm a little excited to get an answer to the question of whether there really is an afterlife."
9451,158,0,30,ESTJ,31,"<Yes>  I think there were no people around me because of my personality that pursues perfection. Now that I'm getting older, I find it enjoyable to spend time with other people these days."
9452,158,0,30,ESTJ,32,"<no>  All discussions are, in the end, an exploration of theories and principles. This is not the case because other opinions basically believe that theories and principles should be premised."
9453,158,0,30,ESTJ,33,"<no>  I always believe that people are different, so I try to understand, but I don't think I can easily empathize. However, I try to think from the person's point of view. Because people have different characteristics."
9454,158,0,30,ESTJ,34,"<no>  I like to stay out of the way with a deliberate time plan. So if a decision needs to be made, I tend to make it right away."
9455,158,0,30,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  When the time of decision approaches, I do not look back with the belief that the decision is right because I make it through more review and thought than anyone else."
9456,158,0,30,ESTJ,36,"<no>  I like spending time with people rather than being alone. So, I do a lot of club activities. Alone time is good, but most of it is spent together, preparing for next week."
9457,158,0,30,ESTJ,37,"<no>  I like to think and act rationally rather than emotionally. So, I am not very interested in art."
9458,158,0,30,ESTJ,38,"<no>  I appreciate the diversity of people. Therefore, keeping in mind that not everyone's thoughts can be the same, we make a lot of effort to understand from each other's point of view."
9459,158,0,30,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  love to keep things running through a plan. Therefore, I like to plan, and I believe that preparation will make me a better person."
9460,158,0,30,ESTJ,40,<no>  I am a person who pursues perfection. So I always check and question whether there is anything wrong no matter what I do. I think this is because I chose a major that values reliability and transparency.
9461,158,0,30,ESTJ,41,"<Yes>  want to avoid emotional and emotional things. When you talk on the phone, I think there is a high chance that you will be dominated by emotions and emotions. So I prefer text."
9462,158,0,30,ESTJ,42,"<Yes>  I acknowledge the diversity of people, so if you have a different opinion from mine, I try to actively understand it. When I had a difference of opinion while in the club, I always put myself in the other person's shoes and thought about it."
9463,158,0,30,ESTJ,43,<Yes>  contact you to meet first. because that's what i want I don't think there is any need to hesitate.
9464,158,0,30,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  I want things to go as planned as possible. So if there is a setback, I try to get back to the plan. However, if the plan is wrong in the first place, he is not afraid to correct it. But there is no such situation yet."
9465,158,0,30,ESTJ,45,"<Yes>  I always pursue perfection. So, if I have any doubts about my actions, I tend to regret them. Recently, as I get older, my judgment seems to be clouded, so I often think about this."
9466,158,0,30,ESTJ,46,<Yes>  I believe that humans do not choose their own lives. So I don't think deeply about why I live. It's about living hard.
9467,158,0,30,ESTJ,47,"<no>  Because I aim to think and act rationally, I do not want to control my emotions and be swayed by them. Therefore, I tried not to do that, and I am evaluated as a rational person by those around me."
9468,158,0,30,ESTJ,48,"<Yes>  seek perfection. However, since I am also a human being, I don't want to dig into the faults of the other person. I think good is good. Also, the other person must feel something of my consideration for this kind of consideration."
9481,159,0,30,ISTJ,1,<no>  I don't bother making new friends. The reason is that we don't like to care about each other.
9482,159,0,30,ISTJ,2,<Yes>  I am interested in two jobs and investments. The reason is because I want to make a lot of money.
9483,159,0,30,ISTJ,3,"<no>  rarely feel like crying. The reason is because that person is sad, not me."
9484,159,0,30,ISTJ,4,<Yes>  I make several preparations. The reason is that it can take longer to fix if things suddenly go wrong.
9485,159,0,30,ISTJ,5,<Yes>  I tend to keep my composure. I was able to complete it on time by focusing on the work that seemed impossible until the deadline and taking it step by step.
9486,159,0,30,ISTJ,6,<Yes>  usually talk to people I already know. I feel uncomfortable starting a conversation with someone new.
9487,159,0,30,ISTJ,7,"<neutrality>  Depends on what kind of project it is. Depending on the situation, you can do it together, or you can finish all the urgent things first and start the next project."
9488,159,0,30,ISTJ,8,"<no>  I am not sentimental. In general, they tend to take a sober view of the situation."

9490,159,0,30,ISTJ,10,"<no>  A small mistake will not cause you to doubt your abilities or knowledge. If I make a mistake, I admit it and promise to be more meticulous next time."
9491,159,0,30,ISTJ,11,"<no>  It's not easy. I worry about what topic to start a conversation with, how to act, and how to express myself."
9492,159,0,30,ISTJ,12,<Yes> I'm not really interested in a discussion about this. I think that works of art are up to interpretation.
9493,159,0,30,ISTJ,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. I tend to look at the situation objectively. It seems that people around them see it that way too.
9494,159,0,30,ISTJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan. Sometimes I improvise, but most of the time I tend to plan."
9495,159,0,30,ISTJ,15,"<Yes>  I'm not too concerned. If you care about how you look to others, you're going to get very tired."
9496,159,0,30,ISTJ,16,"<no>  I only enjoy group activities made up of a few close people, and the rest are uncomfortable. These days, there are almost no meetings of close acquaintances due to corona."
9497,159,0,30,ISTJ,17,<neutrality>  The things people say are fun to watch and enjoy regardless of the ending. I have watched almost all the Marvel series that have good ratings and are recommended by my acquaintances.
9498,159,0,30,ISTJ,18,"<no> My success comes first. It's good to help others, but I think success comes first."
9499,159,0,30,ISTJ,19,"<Yes>  I have a lot of interests. There are many fields of interest such as investment, two jobs, video, and photography, but there are many times when it is difficult to know what order to do within a limited time."
9500,159,0,30,ISTJ,20,"<neutrality> I'm not worried about the little things going wrong, but I'm worried about the big things going wrong. There are many things that I tried to do as a hobby but couldn't try because I was worried about what to do if something went wrong."
9501,159,0,30,ISTJ,21,<Yes>  I don't like leadership roles. I have experienced a lot of stress due to the desire to perfect the achievement of the goal while encompassing everyone.
9502,159,0,30,ISTJ,22,<no>  You seem to have above average artistic inclinations. I heard a lot from my acquaintances that I would do well if I worked in the arts.
9503,159,0,30,ISTJ,23,"<neutrality>  I do not know. I think it would be nice to have both in harmony. If it's leaning to one side, there's something bad about it."
9504,159,0,30,ISTJ,24,<no>  I tend to rest first and finish my chores. That also makes me feel comfortable.
9505,159,0,30,ISTJ,25,<no>  It's not enjoyable. I don't like to argue. I don't know why they act like they're fighting something that can be resolved happily.
9506,159,0,30,ISTJ,26,<Yes>  You try not to attract other people's attention. I try to dress normally.
9507,159,0,30,ISTJ,27,"<no>  change slowly. When I see other people go from being happy to being very angry, I often don't understand why their emotions change so quickly."
9508,159,0,30,ISTJ,28,<Yes> I'm annoyed. I've had conversations with co-workers who are not bothered to change when the inefficiencies are glaringly obvious.
9509,159,0,30,ISTJ,29,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it is and sometimes it is not. I finish what I have to do at work right away, but I put off personal matters unless it is very urgent."
9510,159,0,30,ISTJ,30,"<no>  I don't think it's interesting. I believe there is an afterlife, but I'm wondering if I need to ask a question."
9511,159,0,30,ISTJ,31,<no> It's comfortable to spend time alone. I'm tired of meeting so many people these days.
9512,159,0,30,ISTJ,32,"<no>  I think the theory center is more fun. In YouTube or TV lectures, theories were first explained and other things were explained, so I understood better and was able to listen interestingly."
9513,159,0,30,ISTJ,33,"<Yes>  It's easy to relate to. Even if I talk to someone from a different background, I think it might be."
9514,159,0,30,ISTJ,34,"<neutrality>  make decisions on simple things right away, but I tend to postpone complex things until last."

9516,159,0,30,ISTJ,36,<no>  Better to spend some time alone. I try to spend as much time alone as possible these days.
9517,159,0,30,ISTJ,37,"<Yes>  I like. Occasionally, I go to art galleries or exhibitions and look at the works to clear or fill my mind."
9518,159,0,30,ISTJ,38,"<no>  I tend to try to understand other people's feelings. I'm not in a situation where I'm angry, but when the other person is angry, I often think that I might be angry at this point."
9519,159,0,30,ISTJ,39,"<Yes>  If you don't plan, things don't go well. I tend to make a plan first and then start working. So are personal things."
9520,159,0,30,ISTJ,40,"<Yes> There are very few times when I feel anxious. Since I was young, I've lived a positive life, so I don't feel insecure."
9521,159,0,30,ISTJ,41,<Yes>  I would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. Talking on the phone is stressful.
9522,159,0,30,ISTJ,42,"<no>  Doesn't take a lot of time. I have many experiences, but whenever it happens, I just think it could be like that and move on."
9523,159,0,30,ISTJ,43,"<neutrality>  I ask to meet really close friends first, but I don't contact friends who are not first."
9524,159,0,30,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  It feels good to go back to plan. In particular, there are a lot of things that need to be changed if things don't go back as planned due to work, so I have some experience trying to get things right and go back."
9525,159,0,30,ISTJ,45,"<no>  I think I can't help the mistakes of a long time ago, and I think about what to do afterward."
9526,159,0,30,ISTJ,46,<Yes>  I tend not to think deeply. Thinking about it doesn't seem to help my life.
9527,159,0,30,ISTJ,47,<no>  I tend to have less emotional highs and lows. People around me seem to think so too.
9528,159,0,30,ISTJ,48,"<neutrality>  When the other person's fault hurts only me, I try to save face, but when it hurts others, it seems that I don't even try. I guess it's because other people are also hooked up."
9541,160,1,20,INFP,1,"<no>  It's good to be with friends who know you for a long time and know you well, and the more friends you have, the more attention you can give to each friend, so I don't make new friends periodically."
9542,160,1,20,INFP,2,"<neutrality> When I'm not busy, I look for different interests. But it doesn't dig deep. My current interest is painting with oil pastels and decorating my room. I saw the process of drawing oil pastels while browsing YouTube, and I liked the texture and feel of the painting. I find pictures that I like on Pinterest, save them, and draw them accordingly, even though I am an amateur. Room decoration is a new interest that I'm going to do soon, so I took a look at the house of the day site. Before, I didn't even think about decorating because I lived with my family and couldn't have a room of my own, but I'm glad I got this opportunity to decorate it to my liking."
9543,160,1,20,INFP,3,"<neutrality>  When you can empathize with the situation or emotions of the person who is crying, tears come out accordingly. Also, it seems that the closer I am to someone, the more I cry along with them. It's not a situation I've been through, but as I empathize with it, tears well up as if I've been through that situation."
9544,160,1,20,INFP,4,"<neutrality>  It depends on the type of work and its importance. In the case of a company job or something that someone could be harmed by my actions, I prepare a number of preparations. I make preparations for each situation that could happen, and in the case of things that are less important and that affect only me even if they go wrong, I do not set up a separate countermeasure, but when something happens, I solve it ad hoc."
9545,160,1,20,INFP,5,"<no>  There was a time when I was in a bad mood at work because I had an argument with a senior teacher, but I ended up crying. I know that it's not a grown-up act to resolve it with tears when I'm under a lot of pressure, but tears come out without my knowledge. I am very nervous during interviews, so my voice trembles and becomes small, and my words come out quickly."
9546,160,1,20,INFP,6,"<neutrality>  I tend to observe and talk to new people. The behavior also depends on what kind of event it is. When my peers are gathered and they seem to have a similar disposition to me, I speak to them first, but when I am judged to have a different disposition, I never speak to them first, and if there is someone I know around me, I run away."
9547,160,1,20,INFP,7,"<neutrality>  It is solved differently depending on the scale of the work. If the deadline is close and the scale is large, I completely immerse myself in the task and solve it, and I have plenty of time until the deadline, and if it is a small task, I tend to work on it little by little and finish it when the deadline approaches."
9548,160,1,20,INFP,8,"<Yes>  I am easily pleased and moved by small things. I am moved when I read good deeds in the news, and I am moved when someone pays attention to me, praises me, or gives me a gift. Also, when I heard about being scolded or evaluated, the memory lasts for a long time and I keep it in my heart."
9549,160,1,20,INFP,9,"<no>  I bought a diary and never wrote more than one page. When I was young, I wrote a rough schedule for vacation plans and study timetables. I thought it would be difficult to finish the schedule on time even if I made a plan. Even now, when I have a schedule to do, I list it in words and solve it by grouping it on the day I go out."
9550,160,1,20,INFP,10,"<no>  It's literally a mistake, so I don't doubt my abilities. If someone points out the knowledge that I know incorrectly, then I think I can remember it as correct knowledge from now on."
9551,160,1,20,INFP,11,"<neutrality> It depends on whether you are of the opposite or same sex. In the case of the same sex, you can approach and have a conversation right away, but in the case of the opposite sex, after observing for some time, you decide if it suits you and then approach."
9552,160,1,20,INFP,12,"<no>  am very interested. It is very interesting to compare the interpretation from my point of view to the interpretation from someone else's point of view. So after going to the art museum, I like to talk with my friends about their interpretations, and I like to search the Internet for the intention and explanation of the work."
9553,160,1,20,INFP,13,<no>  often regret making judgments that are not rational and are often swept away by emotions. There were many times when I accepted the loss with the thought that I should empathize with and help others. Friends and family often give advice not to be swayed by emotions.
9554,160,1,20,INFP,14,"<neutrality>  It depends on what schedule you have. When it comes to travel, I like trips with a rough framework rather than wandering around without any framework. When a friend asks to play, it's nice to be able to feel the fun in its own way because you can go around freely without having to have a plan."
9555,160,1,20,INFP,15,"<no>  I want to appear as a good person to others as much as possible, so I try and worry a lot. I think a lot about whether my actions will not be well-received by others. And I often worry about how others will feel about me after seeing what I do after my actions."
9556,160,1,20,INFP,16,"<neutrality>  Aside from performing on stage, I try hard to participate in company events. It's a job that I've been doing, but I'm going to have a good time with the thought that one person should do it. And if it's an activity that other people want to work hard on, they tend to work harder."
9557,160,1,20,INFP,17,"<Yes>  I like closed happy endings, but I also like open endings where the ending changes depending on how you interpret it. For this reason, my favorite work is not a recent one, but I remember a book called The Tale of Mr. Sommer. I like works with open endings in that I can change the ending to my liking, whether Mr. Sommer, who went into the water, is dead or alive and wandering around again."
9558,160,1,20,INFP,18,"<neutrality>  I don't think I'll be satisfied with helping others succeed at the cost of a big loss. However, if it is a somewhat acceptable level of sacrifice, I think it would be nice for others to succeed."
9559,160,1,20,INFP,19,"<no>  They are not so preoccupied with their interests that they don't know what to do next. It's because even if you have an interest, it's because the interest is on the side of the side."
9560,160,1,20,INFP,20,"<Yes>  often worry about the future by imagining negative outcomes. It's something that hasn't happened yet, but I often hear from acquaintances that I don't have to worry because I imagined the worst and worried a lot. I have a tendency to be a perfectionist, so it seems that I worry about things going wrong if things go a little wrong. And because of this tendency, there are many times when work is postponed. I've read psychology articles that say that we procrastinate because we're afraid we won't be able to do it perfectly."
9561,160,1,20,INFP,21,"<neutrality> When no one is taking the lead, I think I have to step in as well. This is because if we wait forever thinking that someone will step in and do it, we can all suffer damage together."
9562,160,1,20,INFP,22,"<no>  am interested in art. I am interested in music and art, and I am also interested in movies. The content of the work is important, but I am very interested in how the video was shot and what the painting technique was. I also enjoy painting as a hobby and going to exhibitions. I didn't go to an art academy or take any classes, but I drew well from a young age and received compliments."
9563,160,1,20,INFP,23,"<no> If only rationality is valued, it may be a fair world, but it is unlikely to be a warm world. Sometimes, there are many things that are more appropriate to solve with emotion than reason. I think there will be many things that make inflexible judgments if you think only of reason."
9564,160,1,20,INFP,24,"<Yes>  If I do housework after resting, it will be very late at night in my life pattern, and if I do housework at that time, I will cause damage to the people around me, so I like to finish my housework in advance and rest."
9565,160,1,20,INFP,25,"<Yes>  Unless you're arguing about a serious topic, it's interesting to hear each other's opinions. I don't like it when an argument turns into a fight, but it's nice to hear a proper discussion. I think it's interesting to hear different opinions."
9566,160,1,20,INFP,26,"<Yes> You try not to attract attention from others. Because it's embarrassing to be in the spotlight. I also have facial flushing, so my face turns red, so I don't like being in the spotlight."
9567,160,1,20,INFP,27,"<Yes>  Even if you don't feel good when you get scolded, you quickly get over it. Even when we fought, there were many times when we suddenly laughed when we saw each other face to face, and the fight fizzled out."
9568,160,1,20,INFP,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who have no work. However, instead of being overtly irritated, they turn around and give advice or print out guidelines to help you do your job better. The new successor's work was slow, so he helped me by telling me what areas to improve, and helped me until I was able to handle the work quickly myself."
9569,160,1,20,INFP,29,"<Yes>  My TOEIC score expired, so I applied for a new test, but I crammed in two weeks before the test. In addition, job posting applications are usually submitted on or before the deadline."
9570,160,1,20,INFP,30,"<Yes> Interesting. I think it's more interesting because there is no one who has actually experienced and returned to the afterlife, such as whether there really is an afterlife, whether heaven and hell exist, how it feels, and how it feels when you die."
9571,160,1,20,INFP,31,"<neutrality>  I usually like to be alone, but these days, I also enjoy spending time with other people eating delicious food and chatting. It may be because the summer when the temperature of the person next to you felt annoying has passed."
9572,160,1,20,INFP,32,<Yes>  It's boring to talk about theory. It's much more fun to talk about endless stories with imagination. The people around me also have no experience because they do not engage in theory-based discussions.
9573,160,1,20,INFP,33,"<Yes>  think I can imagine and sympathize with that person thinking that it is me. Among my acquaintances, there is a person who graduated from a confectionery school and opened a bakery, and I was able to empathize with him while talking about the stress he felt due to his territorial attitude while working, so I understood his feelings."
9574,160,1,20,INFP,34,"<Yes>  Because we want to make the best decision, we often put it off until the last minute. This is because there may be variables that you have not thought of before making a hasty decision."
9575,160,1,20,INFP,35,"<no> Even if you make a decision, rethink it over and over again. Because, like I said before, I want to make the best choice."
9576,160,1,20,INFP,36,<no>  I have never been exhausted from going to a party or event. Spending my own time at home by myself is less tiring and I feel more comfortable.
9577,160,1,20,INFP,37,"<Yes>  like to see art in art galleries. Periodically search for exhibition schedules and make reservations. Besides going to art galleries, I also like to look at things like sculptures and paintings on walls that I pass by."
9578,160,1,20,INFP,38,<no>  I can understand most people's emotions. I can imagine how I feel in the situation that person was in.
9579,160,1,20,INFP,39,"<no>  don't like making plans every day because it's tiring. The work is done in order with only a rough framework in mind, but because variables can occur, detailed plans are not made."
9580,160,1,20,INFP,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. After making too many subway stations or making a choice, I worry and feel anxious that my choice might be wrong. It seems to be an innate tendency. Even as a child, I often felt insecure."
9581,160,1,20,INFP,41,"<Yes> When you make a phone call, you can't see the other person's expression, and you have to guess the other person's mood only with their voice and tone, which is unsettling. Also, there are cases where the answers you thought do not come out, which can lead to embarrassing situations. In addition, there are many cases where the other person changes his or her words when there is a need to cover up wrongs because records are not left if you do something over the phone. That's why I prefer text messages or e-mails that leave a record."
9582,160,1,20,INFP,42,<no>  I don't think you need to understand everyone's opinions. I think it's good for mental health to just think about this person's opinion and move on.
9583,160,1,20,INFP,43,"<neutrality>  In most cases, you will not be asked to meet first. I suggest meeting first with friends you haven't seen in a long time or who seem to have concerns when you contact them online."
9584,160,1,20,INFP,44,"<Yes>  think that what has already happened can't be helped, and I'm trying to do it as planned as soon as possible. There was a setback due to the senior teacher's mistake while processing work, but in order to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, I reported it to my supervisor and presented a solution at the same time, so I was able to handle the work as originally planned."
9585,160,1,20,INFP,45,"<Yes>  There are many times when I suddenly think about my mistakes of a long time ago. Among my recent experiences, I was eliminated in the final interview for a full-time position, but I regretted that I should have appealed more to my capabilities."
9586,160,1,20,INFP,46,"<no>  I often think about the reason for human existence. It is also a question that is often asked by people around you. I think about how the existence of human beings came into existence, and if there was a creator, for what reason would they have been created? Also, I think about what I am living my life for and what the meaning of my life is."
9587,160,1,20,INFP,47,"<neutrality>  I am swayed by my emotions, but I try hard to control my emotions. My thoughts and those around me say that I am easily swayed by emotions, so I try to hold on to the strings of emotions. But it doesn't work well because of the natural tendency."
9588,160,1,20,INFP,48,"<Yes> When the other person makes a mistake, I tend to speak as roundly as possible or go over it without pointing out the mistake at all. It's because we want to get along well without being offended by each other, and we think that not all humans can live perfectly. Also, I am a person who makes a lot of mistakes, and I don't think that person made mistakes because he wanted to."
9601,161,0,40,ENFJ,1,"<Yes>  I tend to make a lot of new friends on a regular basis. The reason is because I am a pastor, so I naturally meet a lot of new people and form relationships with them."
9602,161,0,40,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  I invest a significant part of my free time in learning new things. The reason is because it's fun to try new things. Among my interests these days, I tend to invest time in various tasks that can be experienced in Crowd Works, studying for the first-class social worker certification exam, which I have been interested in for a long time, and self-development using the People's Learning for Tomorrow card."
9603,161,0,40,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  said that I am a pastor (pastor) in the previous question. As a result, I meet a relatively large number of people, and most of those who ask for counseling from pastors come to me when they are having a hard time and apply for counseling. After a long consultation, there are times when most of the people I counseled get so emotional that they cry. When I talk to them to comfort them, there are times when tears pour down without even realizing it. I take care of my emotions first, comfort and encourage others, and encourage them. I think we should not force ourselves to hold back or stop crying, and we should wait long enough to express our anger."
9604,161,0,40,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  I am more cautious than an extrovert. I cannot allow myself to make the slightest mistake. Since I'm not perfect, I tend to try to come up with several countermeasures. I don't like to expose my shortcomings to others through small mistakes, so I tend to make preparations."
9605,161,0,40,ENFJ,5,"<Yes> Since I am in my mid-40s, it seems that I cannot avoid various psychological pressures. If you express pressure negatively, it will cause stress, but if you express it positively, it gives you a moderate amount of tension, so I think it is an element that prevents you from making mistakes. So I guess I can keep my composure. Recently, while thinking about my future career path, I had a time to promise to start again from the beginning."
9606,161,0,40,ENFJ,6,"<no> It's not difficult for me to talk to new people. I also like to introduce myself to others. So, I always like to meet and talk with new people on a regular basis and enjoy it."
9607,161,0,40,ENFJ,7,"<no> If I have other interests while working on a project, I tend to start that project at the same time. Others say that I can't concentrate, but I don't think it's bad to work on several projects at the same time if you know the basics. For example, if only the core of the license plate shooting project requested by Crowd Works can be grasped, it is considered more efficient to shoot 2-3-4 license plates at the same time."
9608,161,0,40,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  It's not very sentimental, but that doesn't mean it's not dry. This is because it varies from case to case depending on the situation."
9609,161,0,40,ENFJ,9,<Yes>  I am proud to see things going according to plan. It is very rewarding and exciting to write down various plans in a diary and check them when they are completed.
9610,161,0,40,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  I think my little mistakes affect my career and my future. Furthermore, I hate to tolerate any mistakes because I think others might ignore me."
9611,161,0,40,ENFJ,11,"<Yes>  I adapt well to a new environment and am not shy, so if I am interested, I can have a conversation regardless of age, nationality or gender. When I was working in Spain in the past, I had many local friends."
9612,161,0,40,ENFJ,12,"<Yes>  It is literally my subjective interpretation, and if it is not related to the artist's intention, it is because I do not want to waste time trying to carry out that interpretation."
9613,161,0,40,ENFJ,13,"<no>  I try to follow reason, but I still often handle things according to my emotions, and I sometimes hear people around me telling me not to work based on my emotions."
9614,161,0,40,ENFJ,14,"<no>  Generally, I try not to deviate from what I have planned, but when I cannot avoid it, I do impromptu work to the extent that I can handle all the planned schedule."
9615,161,0,40,ENFJ,15,"<no>  I always have a strong desire to be seen as a more upright person than others, so I tend to worry a lot. It seems that such an obsession came about because I am a pastor."
9616,161,0,40,ENFJ,16,"<no>  I can't help it if I have to do group activities inevitably, but these days I feel comfortable and happy being alone as much as possible. Sometimes I think it's because it's menopause."
9617,161,0,40,ENFJ,17,<no>  like books and movies that can relieve stress rather than being sentimental. My stress was relieved after watching Ma Dong-seok in Crime City 2.
9618,161,0,40,ENFJ,18,"<Yes>  I am happy and happy to be satisfied with my success, but I think that if I can help others and make others happy because of me, it is a more valuable and successful life."
9619,161,0,40,ENFJ,19,"<Yes>  Don't be afraid to know and learn what you don't know. Recently, during summer vacation, I took the cargo driver qualification test. I was worried that I shouldn't fall, but I was happy with the preparation time, and the pleasure of passing the exam made me forget my fatigue. I haven't decided what to do next, but I encourage and praise myself saying that there are many things I want to do because I am still young."
9620,161,0,40,ENFJ,20,"<Yes>  It's because I have an obsession to do it again if something goes wrong, and I think that unnecessary time is wasted."
9621,161,0,40,ENFJ,21,"<no>  Rather, I tend to work ahead. I enjoy working at the forefront because I want to help the members who believe in me and follow me well."
9622,161,0,40,ENFJ,22,<no> My undergraduate major is vocal music. Song lyrics cannot be conveyed without an artistic sense. That's why I think I have an artistic inclination.
9623,161,0,40,ENFJ,23,"<Yes>  If it hadn't been biased toward emotion, it would have been bleak, but the pace of development would have been a little faster."
9624,161,0,40,ENFJ,24,<Yes>  It seems that complete relaxation can be achieved only when everything is completed perfectly. It seems to be a routine rather than a certain feeling.
9625,161,0,40,ENFJ,25,<Yes>  It's because I can think of myself once more while watching things that I can't think of come and go.
9626,161,0,40,ENFJ,26,"<neutrality>  You try not to attract attention, but you are forced to do so because of your appearance and personality. I think so because of the way I am interested in everything."
9627,161,0,40,ENFJ,27,"<Yes>  I think it's because the conveying of emotions is on the honest side. It's because I feel pitiful and pitiful when I see people who are less fortunate than me, but sometimes I feel critical about why they don't even do manual labor."
9628,161,0,40,ENFJ,28,"<Yes>  We gave the same task and started together, but even if I tried to start another task after it was over, my partner didn't finish, so I get stressed if I can't do something different."
9629,161,0,40,ENFJ,29,"<no>  When a task is given to you, you have to finish it before others in order to fulfill your instincts. If I can't finish, I can't sleep. Even at this moment."
9630,161,0,40,ENFJ,30,"<Yes>  As a religious person, the conclusion is one. The reactions of those who deny that conclusion are different are interesting."
9631,161,0,40,ENFJ,31,"<no>  I thought it was beneficial to spend time with other people, but these days, maybe because of my age, being alone is more fun and happy than being with other people."
9632,161,0,40,ENFJ,32,"<Yes> Because I think there is no answer. The theory-centered conclusion cannot create anything new, and the principled story continues to hover in its place. When I look at the personnel selection hearing, I think that it is not a hearing to verify abilities, but a hearing to bring out only the wrong things. Whenever that happens, I think of myself as a male fire."
9633,161,0,40,ENFJ,33,"<Yes>  The world can't all be the same. That is why diversity must be acknowledged. Also, I don't think it's bad to experience it indirectly through the stories of others."
9634,161,0,40,ENFJ,34,"<Yes>  The more cautious you are, the more likely you are to postpone a decision until the end. Sometimes we think too carefully and narrowly escape the penalty."
9635,161,0,40,ENFJ,35,"<Yes>  It's unfortunate, but I don't think it can be undone. That's why I think it's practical to think about other things and decide."
9636,161,0,40,ENFJ,36,"<no> These days, being alone and thinking alone are more effective in recovering from fatigue. Events and parties rather result in accumulated fatigue."
9637,161,0,40,ENFJ,37,<no>  I prefer reading books or listening to music rather than art galleries.
9638,161,0,40,ENFJ,38,"<Yes>  I think I understand my feelings, but sometimes I get stressed because I think people around me take it completely differently."
9639,161,0,40,ENFJ,39,<Yes>  I tend to plan what I have to do each day in advance and feel the joy of accomplishing the things I planned one by one.
9640,161,0,40,ENFJ,40,"<no>  They say that their natural inclination is that they will not have any worries or concerns, but there are many times when they are more worried and anxious because they are afraid that they will look different from what others thought."
9641,161,0,40,ENFJ,41,"<no>  It's less than meeting and talking, but I like phone calls because enough emotions are conveyed."
9642,161,0,40,ENFJ,42,"<no>  When I was younger than now, I worked hard to achieve my will, but now I think it is rather efficient to acknowledge and accept differences rather than to carry through my will. Recently, I had a confrontation with a co-worker over the same ending. As I conceded and understood, it wasn't the conclusion I had in mind, but it ended well."
9643,161,0,40,ENFJ,43,"<no> In the past, I suggested that we meet first, but these days I feel comfortable being alone, so I don't contact him first."
9644,161,0,40,ENFJ,44,"<Yes>  If it's something I have to do anyway, I'll try to start over as soon as possible. I haven't been recently, so there's nothing to talk about."
9645,161,0,40,ENFJ,45,"<no>  Even just a few years ago, I regretted and regretted my past mistakes. I don't know if it's because I've grown a little more mature or because I've lost my motivation, but now I can't turn back just because I regret my past mistakes, so I bury them as memories."
9646,161,0,40,ENFJ,46,"<no>  Everyone has a mission assigned to them. There will be people who make an effort to meet the mission, and there will be people who do not. But when I die, I want to be remembered by others as a good person and a hard worker. So I think we should try to live harder."
9647,161,0,40,ENFJ,47,"<no>  I put a lot of effort into mind control, but if I lose my guard for a moment, I want to be swung around. It is said that I am good at controlling my emotions because I have the personality to achieve what I think first and then look around."
9648,161,0,40,ENFJ,48,"<Yes> Because everyone can make mistakes. Because I am a human being, I could make mistakes, and when I was young, I thought that I could only survive by defeating the other person, but now I feel happy by saving that person's face. That's why we often cover up our mistakes."
9661,162,1,30,ENFJ,1,"<no>  As I get older, I spend more time interacting with old friends and acquaintances than spending energy making new ones. The reason is because they feel comfortable and rather get energy from them."
9662,162,1,30,ENFJ,2,<Yes>  I'm interested in data labeling these days. The reason is because the AI industry is said to be the food of the future.
9663,162,1,30,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  I often shed tears when watching dramas or human documentaries and seeing other people crying. The reason is that she usually cries more than others, and she empathizes well."
9664,162,1,30,ENFJ,4,<Yes>  tend to make preparations when I work. The reason is to respond immediately to unexpected situations.
9665,162,1,30,ENFJ,5,"<Yes>  I tend to do things without being swayed by emotions even in stressful environments. The reason is because I tend to not want to mess things up because of one person. Recently, I had a lot of trouble with my husband's job loss, but rather than struggling together, I overcame a lot by maintaining my composure and giving good advice and comfort."
9666,162,1,30,ENFJ,6,<neutrality>  I get along well with both new people and people I already know. The reason is the fun of meeting new people and the comfort of acquaintances.
9667,162,1,30,ENFJ,7,"<Yes>  tend to proceed with the next project only when the work is clearly finished. We were in charge of performing at a similar time, but we handled the rest of the performances after completing the work accurately and quickly, starting with the earlier performances. The reason is because I want to do one thing meticulously and perfectly, rather than doing several things at once."
9668,162,1,30,ENFJ,8,<neutrality>  I am a bit sentimental. The reason is because I fall into my emotions on a rainy day or listening to my favorite music.
9669,162,1,30,ENFJ,9,<Yes>  tend to plan ahead by researching what I need before going on a trip or shopping. The reason is that planning can reduce unnecessary spending and wasted time.
9670,162,1,30,ENFJ,10,"<neutrality>  I don't doubt myself over small mistakes. The reason is that small mistakes should not be the standard for evaluating people, and I do not remember such experiences."
9671,162,1,30,ENFJ,11,"<Yes>  have a bright personality and tend to approach people easily. In fact, I got along well with foreign friends whom I had never seen before while studying abroad."
9672,162,1,30,ENFJ,12,"<no>  I majored in vocal music. I also love to see art in art galleries. I don't think there is a right answer in art. Since each person has different auditory, visual, and aesthetic tastes, I think various interpretations can come out through discussion."
9673,162,1,30,ENFJ,13,"<neutrality>  I am good at empathy and seem to have a rational side. I hear people around me say that I am a little cold-hearted, but I also hear that I have a lot of warm sides."
9674,162,1,30,ENFJ,14,<no>  I like to plan my day by hour. The reason is that you can use your time efficiently.
9675,162,1,30,ENFJ,15,<neutrality>  majored in vocal music. So I tend to pay a lot of attention to my appearance as a performer. The reason is because I have a job that is seen by others.
9676,162,1,30,ENFJ,16,"<Yes>  The job of a vocalist is not something that can be done alone, but several people make a performance together. So I enjoy working in groups."
9677,162,1,30,ENFJ,17,"<no>  don't like it when a book or a movie has an open ending. Like it or not, I like finishing things rather than looking forward to what's next. Recently, while watching the strange lawyer Woo Young-woo, I can look forward to the next season as I see the happy ending of the main characters."
9678,162,1,30,ENFJ,18,"<Yes> Last year, I helped my opera company with the Young Artist Project. I felt a sense of satisfaction as I watched them change and complete one by one. The reason is that I think it has been a small help for younger friends than me to move toward their dreams."
9679,162,1,30,ENFJ,19,"<Yes> I'm not the type to focus on just one thing. I do a lot of searching on the Internet for various things I am interested in. Then, we often forget what to do next. I'm considering starting a business recently, but there are a few good items, so I'm thinking about which one to choose, and I forget what I was thinking about before that."
9680,162,1,30,ENFJ,20,"<Yes>  Up until this point, I have been living in an unstable economic situation as a vocalist, so I am always worried about my income. So, I always consider and calculate my income for this month and next month before consuming."
9681,162,1,30,ENFJ,21,<Yes>  I prefer to be behind the scenes rather than leading and leading others in a group. The reason is that it is not easy for me to embrace and lead others.
9682,162,1,30,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I think I have been living as a vocalist, studying musical expression, and expressing myself well. If I had no artistic inclination, I would not have been able to become a vocalist."
9683,162,1,30,ENFJ,23,"<neutrality>  In my opinion, emotion and reason should go hand in hand. The reason is that rational judgment is needed more in industrial development, but emotions are more suitable for arts and welfare."
9684,162,1,30,ENFJ,24,<Yes>  I tend to finish my chores first before taking up hobbies or rest. Because I think the finishing of the house is the beginning of rest.
9685,162,1,30,ENFJ,25,<no>  I feel tired just listening to and watching their arguments. So I try not to attend such events.
9686,162,1,30,ENFJ,26,"<Yes>  In my daily life, I try to be careful about attracting other people's attention. Be especially careful when you are with children. This is because children are uncomfortable with being harmed by others."
9687,162,1,30,ENFJ,27,"<no>  don't have extreme mood swings. According to the opinions of people around him, he is rather calm."
9688,162,1,30,ENFJ,28,<Yes>  I tend to get angry at people who aren't efficient at work. I was very angry when I saw my colleague procrastinate and fail to follow through on easy task instructions.
9689,162,1,30,ENFJ,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to get things done quickly. However, due to the recent vacation of the child, the waking up time has been delayed, so there have been times when housework or the child's homework has been delayed."
9690,162,1,30,ENFJ,30,"<neutrality>  I believe in the afterlife. However, I am only slightly interested in it because it is more important to live my life to the fullest."
9691,162,1,30,ENFJ,31,"<no>  I prefer to listen to songs alone or lie down to rest. Even these days, it's good to be alone outside of childcare time."
9692,162,1,30,ENFJ,32,<Yes>  I am active. I don't enjoy elder squabbles in TV debates or casual debates.
9693,162,1,30,ENFJ,33,"<neutrality>  Depending on the situation and time, I sympathize more. For example, while I was studying abroad, I could sympathize with refugees and foreigners who lived in a completely different environment, but I also felt a sense of difference."
9694,162,1,30,ENFJ,34,<no>  I don't easily change my initial decision or regret the consequences of it.
9695,162,1,30,ENFJ,35,<Yes>  do not enjoy looking back or reliving the past. Because the results are already out there.
9696,162,1,30,ENFJ,36,"<no>  As a parent of two children, things are always messy. It's better to have some quiet time alone and relax."
9697,162,1,30,ENFJ,37,"<Yes>  If you are quietly appreciating the painting, you can have psychological stability and bring calm vitality to your daily life."
9698,162,1,30,ENFJ,38,"<no> Not only when meeting old acquaintances, but also when meeting new people, I tend to notice their emotions from moment to moment."
9699,162,1,30,ENFJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my time. When the work is done according to the schedule, I feel joy."
9700,162,1,30,ENFJ,40,"<Yes>  She has a bright natural disposition. So even if you have anxiety, it doesn't last long because you don't think long."
9701,162,1,30,ENFJ,41,"<neutrality> It depends. You tend to be active on calls about work to be done, but don't like to expend your energy on emotional calls."
9702,162,1,30,ENFJ,42,"<no>  I respect other opinions if they are very different from mine, but I don't want to spend my time understanding them."
9703,162,1,30,ENFJ,43,<Yes>  I am good at calling my friends and making appointments first.
9704,162,1,30,ENFJ,44,"<no> If there is a setback in my plan, I seek a different way by making a new plan rather than going back to the collapsed plan."
9705,162,1,30,ENFJ,45,<no>  I try to focus on myself now. I'm not the type to keep thinking about regrets.
9706,162,1,30,ENFJ,46,"<neutrality>  I sometimes think about the reason for living, but I don't think deeply and profoundly."
9707,162,1,30,ENFJ,47,"<no>  I think my thoughts are firm, so I think I can control my emotions well. He says he's calm around him."
9708,162,1,30,ENFJ,48,"<neutrality>  There is a difference between public and private. In public matters, I tend to speak directly, and in private matters, I tend to give comfort. Because mistakes should not be repeated when it comes to work."
9721,163,0,20,ISFP,1,<no>  I prefer interacting with existing friends rather than finding and making new friends. There is a little bit of stress about meeting new people.
9722,163,0,20,ISFP,2,"<neutrality>  I can't say I explore various interests, but I try to find as many interests as possible while watching the news. These days, I am very interested in diet and health."
9723,163,0,20,ISFP,3,"<neutrality>  When I see other people crying, I wonder why they are crying, but I don't feel like crying myself. I seem to get this feeling a lot when I suddenly cry at a drinking party."
9724,163,0,20,ISFP,4,<no>  I tend to prepare for things after they go wrong rather than making plans for when things go wrong. Because you don't know how things are going to go.
9725,163,0,20,ISFP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to try to keep my composure as much as possible even in high-pressure environments. Especially when it comes to job interviews, I tend to feel a lot of pressure, but I try to keep my composure while taking a deep breath."
9726,163,0,20,ISFP,6,"<no>  I tend to enjoy old meetings rather than new ones, so I don't introduce myself first unless it's a special occasion."
9727,163,0,20,ISFP,7,"<Yes>  Running multiple projects at the same time can make things worse and less efficient, so I tend to take on one project and complete it completely."
9728,163,0,20,ISFP,8,"<neutrality>  I don't think it's very sentimental. Even if you watch sad scenes in dramas or movies, there are times when you feel sad together, and there are times when you don't understand."
9729,163,0,20,ISFP,9,"<no>  Rather than planning a schedule or list, I tend to improvise whenever I think of it. However, I tend to plan ahead only for very important things."
9730,163,0,20,ISFP,10,"<no>  Even if you make a small mistake, you don't really doubt your ability. It's because people always live with the idea that anyone can make mistakes. If you tolerate the small mistakes of others, you can be forgiven for your mistakes too."
9731,163,0,20,ISFP,11,"<no>  I wanted to talk to someone I was interested in, but I didn't know how that person would accept it, so I always hesitated and missed the opportunity."
9732,163,0,20,ISFP,12,"<no>  I don't have much interest in the art work itself, so I don't have many interpretations and discussions about the work."
9733,163,0,20,ISFP,13,"<neutrality>  You seem to be influenced a lot by the people around you. If there are many rational people around you, you will follow them rationally, and if there are many emotional people, you will follow them emotionally."
9734,163,0,20,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  I don't like making plans, so I tend to improvise. For example, whenever I suddenly want to watch a movie or go on a trip, I tend to prepare and execute it right away."
9735,163,0,20,ISFP,15,"<neutrality> Looking at a confident person, I have to be that confident, and even if I don't care about my appearance, on the other hand, there are many times when I worry about how I will look."
9736,163,0,20,ISFP,16,"<no>  I prefer to work with a small group or alone rather than with a group of people. Even today, I don't really like group activities."
9737,163,0,20,ISFP,17,"<no>  like books or movies with a definite ending. It's because I have a personality that can't stand being curious, so if it's not completely finished, I'll feel frustrated and curious."
9738,163,0,20,ISFP,18,<Yes>  I tend to feel greater satisfaction in helping others because I have the idea that helping others will help me someday.
9739,163,0,20,ISFP,19,"<no>  Because I tend to focus on one or two interests rather than multiple interests, I have many interests and I rarely know what to do."
9740,163,0,20,ISFP,20,"<no>  I think that even if something goes wrong, I can fix it, so I don't worry too much when something goes wrong."
9741,163,0,20,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  Rather than stepping in and leading the work, I like and feel more comfortable helping and supporting the leader or leaders. Being in the spotlight of many people is stressful."
9742,163,0,20,ISFP,22,"<Yes> From an early age, I was weak in art and music. I rarely drew or created music after thinking about it."
9743,163,0,20,ISFP,23,"<Yes>  I think it will be a better world because if we value rationality, we will not have problems in decision-making or other political areas because our personal emotions will not change our judgment or change."
9744,163,0,20,ISFP,24,"<Yes> When I finish my work first and take a break, I feel more at ease, so if there is something to be done, I tend to do it first."
9745,163,0,20,ISFP,25,"<Yes>  I like hearing other people's opinions rather than expressing them, so I like seeing other people giving their opinions."
9746,163,0,20,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  I'm a bit afraid of getting a lot of attention, so I don't try to get as much attention as possible. I guess it's because I'm an introvert."
9747,163,0,20,ISFP,27,"<no>  If you have one emotion, that emotion tends to last a long time. Feelings tend to fade quickly when I spend time alone."
9748,163,0,20,ISFP,28,"<no>  People think they have their own pace, so I don't get annoyed if I'm not as efficient as I am. It's because if you insist that you're worse than me, you won't be more efficient or you'll miss things that are going well."
9749,163,0,20,ISFP,29,"<neutrality>  I used to like to take a break after doing all the things I had to do, but these days I seem to be putting off one or two things. Since there is not enough rest during work, the thought that I should do everything and rest is gradually dissipating."
9750,163,0,20,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  I can't experience the afterlife right now, and I'm curious about whether or not it exists, so I think questions about the afterlife are very interesting."
9751,163,0,20,ISFP,31,"<no>  Even today, I like to spend time alone. I'm used to being alone because I spend a lot of time playing alone since I was young. I prefer meeting online rather than offline."
9752,163,0,20,ISFP,32,"<no>  When discussing to solve a problem, there are many cases where a theory was wrong or there was a problem in the principle, and the problem was solved by solving it, so I don't think it's particularly boring."
9753,163,0,20,ISFP,33,"<Yes>  I tend to agree that everyone is different and that the environment in which everyone has lived is different, so that person can think that way."
9754,163,0,20,ISFP,34,"<Yes>  If I have the right to make a decision, I tend to postpone making it as much as possible. This is because there is a lot of pressure that everything is decided and progressed by my decision, so I tend to think about it as much as possible."
9755,163,0,20,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  When I make a decision, I tend to think it through, so when I make a decision, I try not to think about it again. Because if you rethink the decision, there are many thoughts that can make things wrong."
9756,163,0,20,ISFP,36,"<no>  Even today, I mostly enjoy spending time alone. It's nice to attend fun parties, but I prefer quiet time."
9757,163,0,20,ISFP,37,"<neutrality>  Originally, I didn't like art very much, but these days I'm trying to increase my artistic sensibility by visiting art museums and listening to music."
9758,163,0,20,ISFP,38,"<no>  I think that each person thinks and feels differently, so I tend to try to understand even if others feel different emotions than I do."
9759,163,0,20,ISFP,39,<no>  don't like to plan things separately because I tend to do what I think of each time rather than plan and proceed.
9760,163,0,20,ISFP,40,<Yes>  It's not often that I feel anxious about anything. It's like a natural tendency.
9761,163,0,20,ISFP,41,"<Yes>  I don't really like talking on the phone. I want to think and say something, but phone calls aren't good, so I prefer text messages or KakaoTalk rather than phone calls."
9762,163,0,20,ISFP,42,"<neutrality>  I try to understand opinions that differ from mine, but I don't spend a lot of time trying to fully understand them."
9763,163,0,20,ISFP,43,"<no>  I prefer to meet up with close friends, but I tend not to contact them first. I tend to listen to incoming calls rather than contacting friends first."
9764,163,0,20,ISFP,44,"<no> There hasn't been a case where the plan has been disrupted yet, but if that happens, the original plan will be considered, but I think we will consider whether another plan is possible."
9765,163,0,20,ISFP,45,"<Yes>  I often think that it would have been nice if I did this suddenly, but I shouldn't have done that then. I'm not sure why."
9766,163,0,20,ISFP,46,"<Yes> Sometimes, when I fall into contemplation, I think about why humans exist and why I live, but I tend to think vaguely that I live because I was born and that humans must exist for some reason."
9767,163,0,20,ISFP,47,"<no>  I've seen in various media that acting emotionally and making decisions can lead to things going wrong, so I'm trying to control my emotions as much as possible. Even the people around me can't grasp my emotions well at once."
9768,163,0,20,ISFP,48,"<Yes>  It's not to save the other person's face, but if I make a mistake later on, I don't want to trip over it, so I don't blame the other person for their mistakes or openly attack them."
9781,164,0,40,INFJ,1,<no>  I tend to maintain relationships with my old friends. I think it's because I'm in a familiar environment and only meet friends I usually meet.
9782,164,0,40,INFJ,2,"<neutrality> In my free time, I spend time on my interests, but not diverse. These days, I read books about the world economy and information and books about history."
9783,164,0,40,INFJ,3,"<no>  I feel sad when I see someone else crying, but I don't think I want to cry with them. I sympathize with your feelings, but I don't think the problem will be solved by crying together. I'm curious about why other people cry and I want to hear their stories."
9784,164,0,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes>  I think when I start working, I think about the number of different cases and make preparations. Things may not always go as planned, so I think it's comforting to have a contingency plan."
9785,164,0,40,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  think I tend to keep my composure even in extreme environments. There was a recent project interview, and there were a lot of pressurized questions, but in general, I think I answered while maintaining my composure. I think various experiences help me to keep my composure."
9786,164,0,40,INFJ,6,"<neutrality> At first, I tend to have conversations with people I am close to, but if the new person is not accustomed to the atmosphere and feels awkward, I think I will approach them first and introduce myself. The reason is that if I go to an environment where there are no close people, I think the other person will also feel awkward in light of the experience of being alone."
9787,164,0,40,INFJ,7,"<neutrality>  like to complete projects in the order I can, but I feel like I'm going according to circumstances. When I assign airline seats to a travel agency, I want to distribute seats on another plane after completion of one flight, but depending on the customer's needs and preferences, there are many cases in which routes are linked, so simultaneous processing is more efficient."
9788,164,0,40,INFJ,8,"<no>  Overall, I think I'm on the rational side. I think the reason is that I have a personality that logically finds a reason in any situation and thinks about the cause. I also think being sentimental is inefficient, especially at work."
9789,164,0,40,INFJ,9,<Yes>  I like to make plans. I use the calendar or notepad on my phone to make plans and revise them when the schedule changes.
9790,164,0,40,INFJ,10,"<no>  don't think I doubt my ability or knowledge with small mistakes. A while ago, there was a case where I was supposed to write English, but couldn't think of an English word. I thought it might be because it has been a while since I lived in English. I also think that I will be able to do well again in an environment where English is often used."
9791,164,0,40,INFJ,11,"<Yes>  think it's fun to talk to people who are interested and want to talk. For the most part, I think starting a conversation with someone you want to talk to was easy. I went to a meeting a while ago, and a senior I admired after a long time came and we started talking happily. I wanted to talk longer, but I think I promised the next time because I was busy."
9792,164,0,40,INFJ,12,"<no>  I think it's fun to discuss works of art. I think the reason is because I can have knowledge about fields I didn't know, and I can think of a different side from myself when I listen to many people's interpretations."
9793,164,0,40,INFJ,13,"<Yes>  I think there are many rational aspects. I tend to judge and proceed rationally when I am working, and it seems that people around me usually ask for rational judgment. My friends often ask me a lot about real estate investing."
9794,164,0,40,INFJ,14,<no>  I think I'm going through the day's schedule mainly with planned things. I think I mostly check the schedule written in my diary and spend the day.
9795,164,0,40,INFJ,15,"<Yes>  I think I care about who I look to other people. As I get older, when I meet acquaintances around me, I think I get older."
9796,164,0,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  I don't think I enjoy group activities these days. Especially after the corona, I think it's going to be a group and people don't like places where a lot of people gather."
9797,164,0,40,INFJ,17,"<Yes>  Watching a movie with an open ending leaves a lasting impression, and it's fun to imagine what will happen next. When I saw the ending of Squid Game a few months ago, I wondered what situation the main character would be in next time."
9798,164,0,40,INFJ,18,"<Yes> My success gives me satisfaction, but I think a greater satisfaction comes from helping others succeed and seeing them happy. I think the reason is because I feel like a useful person to be of some help to someone in my life."
9799,164,0,40,INFJ,19,"<no>  I don't think my interests are diverse. When I have free time, I usually read economic news and history books."
9800,164,0,40,INFJ,20,"<no>  don't think I'm too worried about things going wrong. The reason is that I tend to think about various things before starting work, so I think I proceed according to the situation when I am working."
9801,164,0,40,INFJ,21,<Yes>  Taking on responsibility in a leadership role is not necessarily what you want to do. I think the role of raising the performance of the team while supporting the leader suits my aptitude.
9802,164,0,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  seem to have artistic inclinations. In the past, when I was in school, I got pretty good grades in art classes or art classes, and I like going to museums once in a while to see art works."
9803,164,0,40,INFJ,23,"<Yes>  A while ago, while watching the news about the war in Ukraine, I thought that if people were more rational, they wouldn't start a war."
9804,164,0,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  If you feel like you have to do housework, if you don't clean up and take a break, you'll feel uncomfortable and you won't be able to rest comfortably."
9805,164,0,40,INFJ,25,"<no>  Looking at other people's arguments, it seems to be a pity to emotionally tell the other person what they want to say. It seems like a waste of time when you look at the emotional argument."
9806,164,0,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes> When there are many people or when I go to crowded places, I tend to refrain from doing things that attract other people's attention. When there is a festival event or event, I think it's when I see something I don't want to do by raising my hand and going out on stage."
9807,164,0,40,INFJ,27,"<no>  I don't usually have severe emotional ups and downs. I don't usually think that I'm too happy or unhappy, and I think I'm the type to think that joy and sadness are to some extent as you live."
9808,164,0,40,INFJ,28,"<no>  When I go to a destination that I often go to, I always go the same way. When my family sees me driving, it seems like they always go the same way, but I think it's just because I'm used to it. Even though I know that other roads are faster during work hours, seeing that I am walking on a familiar road that is different from mine, I want to be able to do that too."
9809,164,0,40,INFJ,29,"<neutrality> Depending on the work, there are times when I procrastinate and there are times when I don't. I tend to want to complete work-related tasks as quickly as possible, and when it comes to paying taxes, I think I try to pay them as late as possible."
9810,164,0,40,INFJ,30,"<no>  I don't think I'm interested in the afterlife. The reason is that I don't think there is another world after a person dies, and I don't think it's meaningless to think in advance about the unknown."
9811,164,0,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  think I prefer to spend time alone. These days, I think the number of times I meet people is reduced because of Corona."
9812,164,0,40,INFJ,32,<no>  I tend to think that theory-based discussions are also meaningful. I remember having fun discussing and researching theories in college classes in the past.
9813,164,0,40,INFJ,33,<Yes>  think people from different backgrounds can relate to it when we talk to them. I think I was able to easily understand and empathize with people from different countries when I lived abroad.
9814,164,0,40,INFJ,34,"<no>  Most of the time, I prefer to get things done as quickly as possible without putting them off until the end. I usually solve the most urgent and important things first, and I can postpone personal matters, but I don't think I put them off if I think it's something I have to do."
9815,164,0,40,INFJ,35,"<Yes>  I tend not to rethink things I have already decided on. The reason is that if it was a decision that was already carefully considered, it was the best choice, and if the situation or environment changes and the result of the decision is not good, I think I can change it according to the situation."
9816,164,0,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  I prefer to take a break with my alone time. These days, I think everyone avoids places where you meet a lot of people."
9817,164,0,40,INFJ,37,<Yes>  I think I enjoy going to art galleries. Sometimes I like to go to the city art museum with my kids to see the works.
9818,164,0,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  I think most of it is understandable because I think that if it is not an extreme situation, a person can do that. Even if a colleague says something that really makes no sense at a meeting, that person seems to think that way."
9819,164,0,40,INFJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to do planning. Also, there can always be variables in the planning situation, so it seems reasonable to make a plan that can reflect changes like personal work."
9820,164,0,40,INFJ,40,"<Yes>  I don't think I seldom feel insecure. I'm a bit laid-back by nature, and I think the experience of various environments and social life has made me feel less anxious."
9821,164,0,40,INFJ,41,"<Yes>  These days, I think I prefer contacting via messenger rather than talking on the phone. The reason is that the other person also reads the messenger and I think it is comfortable for each other to contact each other at a convenient time."
9822,164,0,40,INFJ,42,"<no>  tend to admit people who have very different opinions than mine, but I don't think they spend much time understanding them. When I hear a customer's complaint, I think it's less emotionally draining to acknowledge their position than to understand it."
9823,164,0,40,INFJ,43,"<neutrality>  I think I tend to contact friends I haven't seen often asking to meet up first, and I tend to meet friends I see often when they call me."
9824,164,0,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes> If your plans go wrong, you seem to be trying to get back on track. I made a plan to invest in the stocks I recently invested in, but I couldn't purchase additional stocks because the stock price went up, so I waited and bought the stocks when they were adjusted again."
9825,164,0,40,INFJ,45,"<no>  I don't think I have many regrets about my mistakes. Even if I regret a lot, I don't think it's meaningless. I think it's important not to make the same mistake in the future. I think there are regrets in stock investment."
9826,164,0,40,INFJ,46,<no>  Sometimes I think about the reason for living and human existence. The reason is that I think about why I live and what I live for when I look back on the time that has passed when I am busy with my daily life and have a long vacation or free time.
9827,164,0,40,INFJ,47,<no>  It seems to belong to the rational rather than the emotional side. My acquaintances around me seem to evaluate me a lot as being rational.
9828,164,0,40,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  If the other party's fault is obvious, if the other party is also aware of it, it seems to induce the other party to correct the fault without trying to reveal it. I think it's because I also make mistakes and anyone can make mistakes."
9841,165,1,40,ESFP,1,"<Yes>  like making friends. The reason is that I like meeting new people, so new experiences fill me with energy."
9842,165,1,40,ESFP,2,"<neutrality>  I spend a little bit The reason is that I used to like to experience various things, so I kept looking for it, but now that passion has decreased because I'm not feeling well."
9843,165,1,40,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  have many tears. The reason is because crying with that person is empathy. When I've experienced a similar situation, I can't stop crying anymore."
9844,165,1,40,ESFP,4,"<Yes>  I am reminded that whatever happens, something will happen next. So, I tend to think in my head about what to do in preparation for various situations."
9845,165,1,40,ESFP,5,"<no>  tend to lose my composure. The reason is that when time, space, and gaze pressure come, the mind becomes anxious and the situation is frustrating, so it is difficult to regain consciousness."
9846,165,1,40,ESFP,6,"<neutrality>  If there is someone I already know, I tend to think of that person and talk to them, but I also like to be around new people because I like talking to new people."
9847,165,1,40,ESFP,7,"<no>  When I do one thing, I tend to lose my concentration, so I alternate between main and sub-projects."
9848,165,1,40,ESFP,8,"<neutrality>  I used to be sentimental, but these days I feel a little dry. Laugh less when you need to laugh and cry less when you need to cry."
9849,165,1,40,ESFP,9,"<no>  I make a plan out of necessity, but when the plan doesn't work, I feel bad or frustrated, so I tend to improvise."
9850,165,1,40,ESFP,10,"<neutrality>  tend to make mistakes a lot when I think about it, but I tend to blame myself every time. I get very angry when I have to take care of my children's things or I can't buy all the ingredients for cooking."
9851,165,1,40,ESFP,11,"<Yes>  When I make eye contact, I say hello and talk first, so it's not difficult."
9852,165,1,40,ESFP,12,"<no>  It's a field I don't like very much, so I don't have much to say, so I'm not interested."
9853,165,1,40,ESFP,13,"<Yes>  When I do what I have to do, I tend to focus on what I want to do, so I tend to do it emotionally. Others also evaluate them emotionally."
9854,165,1,40,ESFP,14,<Yes>  It is comfortable and good to do what you want to improvise at that time first.
9855,165,1,40,ESFP,15,<no>  I tend to worry. I tend to suppress emotional things a lot because I care about other people's eyes.
9856,165,1,40,ESFP,16,"<Yes>  I find things I enjoy doing, such as clubs, mom cafes, and parent meetings. These days, I'm not feeling well, so I'm refraining from doing it, but I always want to do it."
9857,165,1,40,ESFP,17,<no>  I like decided happy endings. I feel good when I finish reading a book that has a happy ending because it sparks my imagination in many directions.
9858,165,1,40,ESFP,18,"<neutrality>  Helping others because they need my help gives me a sense of accomplishment, but when I compete, I have a competitive spirit and put myself first."
9859,165,1,40,ESFP,19,"<Yes> There are many types of work I am doing right now, but I have experienced difficulties because I was curious about all of them and wanted to practice, so I applied for a lot and couldn't handle it."
9860,165,1,40,ESFP,20,<no>  This is the style of thinking positively that something will work out first and getting upset if it doesn't work in the end.
9861,165,1,40,ESFP,21,"<neutrality>  I want to be a leader in areas I am confident in and can do, but I tend to avoid areas I don¡¯t know because I worry about not being able to do them."
9862,165,1,40,ESFP,22,"<Yes>  don't have any talent or interest, so I don't think it's rare when I see that there is nothing related around me."
9863,165,1,40,ESFP,23,"<no>  If you value rationality, you can be more efficient, but if emotions are missing, I think it will be less durable. I think the power to hold on comes from emotions."
9864,165,1,40,ESFP,24,"<no>  I do housework only after I have rested, my body recovers, and I have room in my mind. The reason is because I don't want to move a single hand before resting."
9865,165,1,40,ESFP,25,<no>  I don't like confrontation and arguing. It's because you feel comfortable when you think the same.
9866,165,1,40,ESFP,26,"<Yes>  I feel ashamed when other people stare at me a lot, so it's better to be normal and natural."
9867,165,1,40,ESFP,27,"<Yes>  I have mood swings. For example, when you go out and meet people in a good mood, and when you come home and see the kids fighting, you immediately feel angry."
9868,165,1,40,ESFP,28,"<Yes>  I like to do it quickly and efficiently, but I understand when I first encounter it, but even after getting used to it, I get annoyed when I can't do it as efficiently as I think."
9869,165,1,40,ESFP,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to do things quickly before I forget, but when I have a lot of things to do, I prioritize things and often put things behind my priorities until the end."
9870,165,1,40,ESFP,30,"<no>  I don't believe in an afterlife. The reason is that the present is important and it is difficult right now, so I want to end it with this life alone without the next life."
9871,165,1,40,ESFP,31,"<neutrality>  I like to spend time with other people, but I'm not feeling well these days, so I'm resting at home because I feel less happy when I see other people."
9872,165,1,40,ESFP,32,"<Yes> This is a bit boring field for me. In the reading discussion, the theory-based discussion was not much fun."
9873,165,1,40,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  Maybe because I like books, I can have a good conversation and empathize even though my background is different."
9874,165,1,40,ESFP,34,"<no>  Decisions always feel better when things are done quickly. The reason is that if you can't make a decision quickly, it won't get out of your head."
9875,165,1,40,ESFP,35,"<Yes>  think about various cases until I make a decision, but after I make a decision, I tend to follow the results without thinking again."
9876,165,1,40,ESFP,36,"<neutrality>  I like both. I like fun parties when I spend my time leisurely according to the busyness of my daily life, and I like to spend time alone and relax when I am very busy. Recently, it's been a tough time for my body and mind, so I'm taking a break."
9877,165,1,40,ESFP,37,"<no> It's not my favorite or interested field, so I don't find it and watch it, but I didn't get bored watching it even though I had a chance."
9878,165,1,40,ESFP,38,"<no>  I am good at understanding. I tend to quickly guess and understand other people's tone of voice, facial expression, and behavior."
9879,165,1,40,ESFP,39,"<no>  I don't like to plan things, but I do like following through."
9880,165,1,40,ESFP,40,"<Yes>  I don't usually feel anxious. I believe that my daily life is safe and comfortable, so I don't worry about things that don't happen. For example, even if a typhoon is coming, we just say it's coming and we shouldn't go outside."
9881,165,1,40,ESFP,41,<no>  I mostly communicate over the phone because it's quicker to resolve and easier to explain. I also like to hear your voice.
9882,165,1,40,ESFP,42,"<no>  When opinions differ greatly from mine, I think it is unavoidable, so I tend to ignore them or forcefully try to understand them quickly."
9883,165,1,40,ESFP,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact them first and ask them to meet. The reason is that I like meeting people and I want to see them first, so it seems to have become a habit."
9884,165,1,40,ESFP,44,<Yes>  tend to work hard to come up with alternatives or solve them quickly because having a setback in my plan is stressful in itself.
9885,165,1,40,ESFP,45,"<Yes>  When I make a mistake, I tend to think about it several times and be careful so as not to make the same mistake again next time."
9886,165,1,40,ESFP,46,<Yes>  I don't think deeply about human existence or the reason for living. Because I'm not very interested in these profound subjects.
9887,165,1,40,ESFP,47,"<Yes> I'm not good at controlling my emotions, so when I'm alone with my family, I move according to my emotions, and when others see me, I tend to control myself."
9888,165,1,40,ESFP,48,"<Yes>  When the other person is in trouble, I just go over it or try to save face. The reason is because my heart is uncomfortable."
9901,166,0,30,ESTP,1,"<Yes>  I like to make people. The reason is that meeting new people is fun, and it is fun to increase my network while building interpersonal relationships."
9902,166,0,30,ESTP,2,"<neutrality>  I do research in a specific area that interests me rather than various things. The reason seems to come from the personality that makes you want to explore only when you are interested. For example, these days, I am interested in data labeling, so I am taking training and joining an internet cafe."
9903,166,0,30,ESTP,3,"<no>  I don't cry or want to cry just because the other person is crying. The reason is rather than crying together, in this situation, I am interested in why this person is crying, so I try to understand the situation and comfort him to stop crying."
9904,166,0,30,ESTP,4,<Yes>  tend to always think of the next best thing in case things go wrong. The reason is to minimize damage and prepare for the future by thinking about the next best thing because work cannot always go as planned.
9905,166,0,30,ESTP,5,"<Yes>  try to keep my composure as much as possible in a pressured environment. The reason is that if you overcome the pressure, you feel that the sense of accomplishment you can achieve is very great. Recently, I had a face-to-face interview at the company where I wanted to change jobs. I responded to the interview with as much composure as possible, and although I didn't achieve it, I think it was a good experience."
9906,166,0,30,ESTP,6,"<no>  I enjoy talking to new people rather than people I know. The reason is that fresh topics from conversations with new people arouse interest, which enables ongoing conversations."
9907,166,0,30,ESTP,7,"<Yes>  I prefer to finish a project I started before moving on to another project. The reason is that if you touch another without finishing one, the thoughts of the previous project affect the new project and rather reduce work efficiency."
9908,166,0,30,ESTP,8,"<no> I'm not sentimental. The reason is that when you start to indulge in sentimental thoughts, you think that your rational judgment is clouded and you can get things wrong."
9909,166,0,30,ESTP,9,"<no>  I don't like to work by making and checking schedules or lists. The reason is that using a diary or electronic tools for scheduling is nerve-wracking, so I organize it only in my head and move accordingly."
9910,166,0,30,ESTP,10,"<no>  I have faith in myself, so I don't suspect a small mistake. The reason is that a small mistake within a big frame is a situation where it can happen enough, so I'm not ignorant, and I tend to pay attention only when there is a big mistake."
9911,166,0,30,ESTP,11,"<Yes> It wasn't difficult for me to start a conversation. The reason is that there is no reason for the other person to hate me, who is new to me, and I think that the other person will be interested in new people, so I was able to start a conversation naturally in any position."
9912,166,0,30,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  I have no interest in art at all. The reason is that I don't feel interest in art works, and I don't think it's necessary to have professional knowledge."
9913,166,0,30,ESTP,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. The reason is that there are many experiences where the results are better when coping with situations rationally than when coping emotionally. People around me say that I see more of the rational side than the emotional side.
9914,166,0,30,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  like to improvise rather than plan. The reason is that I understood this question as the concept of a holiday schedule, and I like going to places I want to go spontaneously rather than planning a schedule and going to play."
9915,166,0,30,ESTP,15,"<Yes>  I don't worry about how others see me. The reason is that each person has a different look, and there will be people who like it and there are people who hate it, but I don't feel the need to match myself to people who don't like it."
9916,166,0,30,ESTP,16,"<Yes>  I enjoy group activities. The reason is that it's good to form bonds with people in group activities. These days, I play a game called StarCraft, and I enjoy participating in Internet clan activities there."
9917,166,0,30,ESTP,17,"<no>  don't like open endings very much. The reason seems to come from the personal idea that books and movies must have an ending. As a result, I enjoyed all the recent works with a fixed ending, and Crime City 2 was memorable."
9918,166,0,30,ESTP,18,"<no>  I feel more satisfaction from my success. The reason is that I can be happy that a close person is doing well, but I think helping others will stand out more when I am a successful person."
9919,166,0,30,ESTP,19,<no>  tend to focus on one interest. The reason is that it is rather difficult to focus on work if you pay attention to several interests.
9920,166,0,30,ESTP,20,"<no>  I don't often worry about work. The reason is that work can go wrong or go well, so I think it's inefficient to care about things that haven't happened."
9921,166,0,30,ESTP,21,"<no>  like to assume a leadership role. The reason is that I like the freedom of being in a position where I can decide and direct within a group, and I like taking on the leadership role because I can set the direction I want to go."
9922,166,0,30,ESTP,22,"<Yes>  I don't think I have artistic inclinations. The reason is that they are unfamiliar with the artistic part and do not pay much attention to it. As an example, I had an experience of not knowing a popular artist."
9923,166,0,30,ESTP,23,"<neutrality>  I value reason, but I don't think it would have made the world a better place. The reason is that I have seen many cases of good precedents being dealt with emotionally, and there is no perception that emotional coping is negative, so I don't think there is any guarantee of a better world. However, there is a thought that if the majority of people make rational judgments, the world will not be a bad world."
9924,166,0,30,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I want my chores to be done first. The reason is that if you take a break while doing housework, you feel like the rest you took before will disappear because you have to do housework again after taking a break."
9925,166,0,30,ESTP,25,"<Yes>  enjoy watching the debate. The reason is that people's debates have the same goal, but it's a debate about exaggeration that needs to be pursued, so it's fun to look at the debate because it's a process of finding a better process."
9926,166,0,30,ESTP,26,"<no>  I tend to get attention. The reason is that there may be a self-satisfied part in all my actions, but I think I am trying to attract attention because I have a desire to be seen by others."
9927,166,0,30,ESTP,27,"<no>  I am not quick to change emotions. The reason is that fast-changing emotions are thought to be revealing oneself too clearly, so even after hearing unfair instructions or inappropriate tone, I try not to reveal my emotions as much as possible."
9928,166,0,30,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed with people who aren't as effective as I am. The reason is because I think that the part that I can do is the part that everyone can do well. For example, one employee of our company completed the task in 1 or 2 hours when it only took 30 minutes. I was very annoyed then."
9929,166,0,30,ESTP,29,"<neutrality> Sometimes I put things off until the end depending on their importance, and other times I don't. The reason is that it is something to be done, but if it is not important, I do not think it is necessary to bring it to the front of the priority list and finish it in advance. Even recently, this trend has been maintained."
9930,166,0,30,ESTP,30,"<no>  I don't believe in an afterlife. The reason is that I am not a religious person who believes in religion, and I wonder if it is necessary to look at the afterlife without scientific basis with interest."
9931,166,0,30,ESTP,31,"<Yes>  I like to spend time with other people rather than alone. The reason is that there are not many things you can do alone, and you can do many things by spending time with a group of people. I don't have a lot of time these days, so I'm not spending a lot of time."
9932,166,0,30,ESTP,32,"<neutrality>  I'm interested in theory-based discussions, but the principled stories are boring. The reason is that I like discussions, but I find it boring and boring if I just talk in principle without being creative. 1 plus 1 is 2, but I felt bored when I had to talk about the origin of this and things like the origin of addition."
9933,166,0,30,ESTP,33,"<Yes>  I think I have the ability to empathize. The reason is that I am interested in my background, but I am interested in the backgrounds of many people because I like stories about people's lives."
9934,166,0,30,ESTP,34,"<no>  think the sooner you decide, the better. The reason is that there are times when a good decision is made through a lot of thought, but I prefer to make a decision quickly and finish the work because I can do many things in the time to make that decision."
9935,166,0,30,ESTP,35,"<Yes>  I do not rethink my decisions. The reason is that it is a decision I made and I have to think about the consequences of the decision I made, and I don't want to attach meaning to the past."
9936,166,0,30,ESTP,36,"<neutrality>  I think I will choose according to the fatigue of the week. The reason is that I don't want to accumulate fatigue while having parties and events in a situation where it's too hard and I have to take a break, and I think it's good to relieve fatigue. I don't have much time these days, so I seem to be spending a lot of time alone."
9937,166,0,30,ESTP,37,"<no>  don't like art galleries. The reason is that interest in art is remarkably low, and it is difficult to understand art works."
9938,166,0,30,ESTP,38,"<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding emotions. The reason is that we try to understand other people's feelings. For example, I try to take care of the complaints and requests of my colleagues at work, and I try to listen to them even though there is nothing I can do for them."
9939,166,0,30,ESTP,39,"<no>  I don't like making plans every day. The reason is that I like planning in a big frame, but making plans every day is very difficult and stressful in itself."
9940,166,0,30,ESTP,40,"<neutrality>  think I feel anxiety according to the importance. The reason is that he feels anxious when he makes a mistake on a very important mission, but doesn't seem to care much about less important missions. It seems that there is a part that became dull as I started my social life."
9941,166,0,30,ESTP,41,<no>  I like to talk on the phone. The reason is that it is thought that there is a very big difference in the ability of communication between a person writing and speaking.
9942,166,0,30,ESTP,42,"<neutrality>  I'll spend a little time on other opinions. The reason is that my opinion is an opinion that I give after thinking about it many times, so there are times when I am puzzled by other opinions, but there can be enough opinions that differ from mine, so I converge opinions after thinking a little."
9943,166,0,30,ESTP,43,"<neutrality> Sometimes I contact them first and sometimes I don't. The reason is that I want to meet comfortably, but if the other person is burdened with contact, I don't think I will contact him."
9944,166,0,30,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  When my plans go wrong, I try to get back to them. The reason is that the plan in the big frame has been disrupted, and it is difficult to maintain it in a situation where it is obvious that the outcome will be bad."
9945,166,0,30,ESTP,45,"<no>  do not regret my old mistakes. The reason is that it is a past mistake anyway, and whether it has been resolved or not, it should not affect the present."
9946,166,0,30,ESTP,46,"<Yes>  I don't think deeply about why I live. The reason is that being born as a human being itself is the reason for existence, and the reason for living is because of the family or acquaintances around you, so you don't seem to think deeply."
9947,166,0,30,ESTP,47,"<no>  I'm not very swayed by emotions. The reason is that emotions are likely to make misjudgments, and judgment is clouded, which can lead to erroneous results. The surrounding evaluation is similar."
9948,166,0,30,ESTP,48,"<no>  want the other person to recognize what they did wrong. The reason is that if the situation went as you insisted and the result was bad, rather than saving face, you should remind yourself that the result is like this because of your fault so that you will not make a mistake the next time the same thing happens again."
9961,167,0,30,ISTP,1,"<no>  I'm not very sociable, so I don't make many friends. The reason is that too many friendships are rather annoying and uncomfortable."
9962,167,0,30,ISTP,2,<no>  mostly explore previous interests. This is because they prefer old interests to hobbies rather than new ones.
9963,167,0,30,ISTP,3,"<neutrality>  There are times when I want to cry when I see a similar experience or situation that I can empathize with in a movie or drama. In this situation, I usually cry and my eyes are red."
9964,167,0,30,ISTP,4,"<neutrality>  If it's relatively unimportant, I'll build one or two, and if it's important, I'll build more than five. The reason is because I think a second plan is necessary."
9965,167,0,30,ISTP,5,"<no>  In a high-pressure environment, I try to stay calm on the outside, but on the inside I have a hard time maintaining my sense of equanimity. My recent experience is that when I was in the top 5 in the online game of the PUBG genre, I lost my composure and failed to rank first."
9966,167,0,30,ISTP,6,"<no> Even if I only know the face, I don't say hello or introduce myself unless I'm in a situation to say hello. I usually talk to people I know. The reason is to enjoy quietly and comfortably at a party or event."

9972,167,0,30,ISTP,12,"<neutrality>  It depends on what kind of work I am. I am very interested in the works I like and don't hesitate to discuss them, but otherwise I avoid them because I'm not interested in them."
9973,167,0,30,ISTP,13,<Yes> It's because I think that rational thinking is right rather than emotion. There are often times when you hear that you are too cold sometimes even around you.

9993,167,0,30,ISTP,33,"<no>  It's hard to sympathize with people who have lived very different lives because the difference in the way they think is so great.

10008,167,0,30,ISTP,48,"<no>  They don't criticize when wrongdoing is obvious, but they don't try to save face. The reason is that if you cover up your wrongdoing, you can create resentment from others as well."

10093,169,0,40,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  tend to follow reason, but there is no end to that. I have often seen problems arise when handling work emotionally. Of course, I can be emotional in my personal relationships, but I try to handle it rationally. The evaluations around it seem to be similar."

10098,169,0,40,INTJ,18,"<no>  My own success is my top priority. The reason is that helping others is not a bad thing, but your own success is the best."
10099,169,0,40,INTJ,19,"<no>  There are times when I have many interests, but I rarely put them into action, so I don't worry. Recently, I am not thinking about other things because I am only concerned with the economy and financial technology."

10103,169,0,40,INTJ,23,"<neutrality>  I know that I only value rationality myself, but emotional things have contributed to the world. To be honest, I don't think the world will get better by focusing only on reason."

10110,169,0,40,INTJ,30,"<no>  I've thought about the afterlife, but it's something I'm not very interested in. The reason is because I think that everything is over when I die anyway."

10120,169,0,40,INTJ,40,<no>  I often feel insecure. It seems to be an innate tendency. I almost always feel anxious about things that have not yet been concluded.
10121,169,0,40,INTJ,41,"<neutrality>  It's not difficult for me to call. However, I do not deliberately call in situations where the phone is not needed. The reason seems to be a matter of efficiency. They don't bother calling for things that can be easily done over text, and they don't text or write emails for things that can be done easily over the phone."
10122,169,0,40,INTJ,42,"<no>  I don't spend a lot of time because I try to admit and move on to the parts where my thoughts differ from mine. Unless it's something I have to spend a lot of time understanding, most of the time I just don't understand it and admit that it's different from me and move on."
10123,169,0,40,INTJ,43,"<no>  I do not contact you first. There are times when I want to do it, but there are many cases that stop thinking."
10124,169,0,40,INTJ,44,"<Yes>  I tend to try to make things go according to plan. Recently, there was a work that was carried out over a week, but it was delayed, so I worked overtime to meet the schedule. It feels comfortable to do so."
10125,169,0,40,INTJ,45,"<Yes>  I have many regrets about the past. Because you know the consequences of making a different choice. These days, I regret a lot about financial technology."
10126,169,0,40,INTJ,46,<Yes>  I don't think deeply about existence and life. The reason is because I think it's useless. And many times we are so busy that we don't even have time to think about it.
10127,169,0,40,INTJ,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions. I've never seen it work properly because I was swayed by emotion. The evaluations around it seem to be similar.
10128,169,0,40,INTJ,48,"<Yes>  I try to save face at first, even when the other person has done something wrong. The reason is that anyone can make a mistake, and I can make the same mistake, so I try to be lenient about the first mistake."
10141,170,0,20,INTJ,1,"<no>  tend to interact with friends I've been close to before, and it's uncomfortable when I meet new people, and it's annoying to meet new people, so I interact with people I already know."
10142,170,0,20,INTJ,2,"<Yes>  Rather than a new interest, it is a way to continue digging in the field of interest in the past and create a new stem. These days, I am interested in blogging."
10143,170,0,20,INTJ,3,"<no>  I'm not very sympathetic to other people's feelings. I rationally recognize that others are sad, but I rarely have ever wanted to cry."
10144,170,0,20,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  In case things don't go well and things get further ruined, I prepare two or three plans."
10145,170,0,20,INTJ,5,"<Yes>  I didn't prepare much for the recent interview, but I answered as usual."
10146,170,0,20,INTJ,6,"<Yes>  I'm comfortable with people I'm comfortable with, so I tend to talk to people I know and then interact with one or two new people."
10147,170,0,20,INTJ,7,"<Yes>  prefer to complete one and work on another project. If you take a job as an example, prepare for an interview right away, and then apply for another company or study for certification."
10148,170,0,20,INTJ,8,"<neutrality>  You can think of it as a middle level, but I myself am on the easy side, but there are times when I hear that I am quite sentimental and emotional when talking about my close friends."
10149,170,0,20,INTJ,9,"<Yes>  don't make detailed schedules for months, days, and hours, but I like to plan in a big way. I don't use the diary well, I just think about it."
10150,170,0,20,INTJ,10,"<no>  You can always make mistakes, and even familiar things become unfamiliar after a long time, so I don't doubt them. Recently, when I drove for the first time in a while, I got lost in the beginning, but I didn't really care."
10151,170,0,20,INTJ,11,"<no> It is difficult to get close to the person you are interested in, but it is not difficult to approach and have a conversation. If there is someone I want to get close to, I tend to approach them and have a small talk."
10152,170,0,20,INTJ,12,"<no>  I like to look at a work in various ways, whether it be literature, painting, or film, so I am interested in hearing opinions."
10153,170,0,20,INTJ,13,"<no>  In terms of consumption, we try to make rational decisions as much as possible. I want to spend it rationally by comparing the current available funds and prices."
10154,170,0,20,INTJ,14,"<no>  There are times when I improvise, but in the big picture, I tend to practice what I had to do the day before or the morning of that day."
10155,170,0,20,INTJ,15,"<no>  If you look at me, I don't have much interest in others, and I think others are similar to me, so I don't worry about my every move. However, I am careful not to harm others."
10156,170,0,20,INTJ,16,"<no>  don't enjoy group activities because I need time alone. However, when necessary, they join a group and do group activities."
10157,170,0,20,INTJ,17,"<neutrality>  There are times when I feel that a work whose ending is not clear is a lack of competence of the writer, so I neither like nor dislike it."
10158,170,0,20,INTJ,18,"<no>  I feel the most satisfaction from winning my own success rather than helping others succeed. After I succeed, I want to help others succeed."
10159,170,0,20,INTJ,19,<no> My interests are clear and there are not many times when I don't know what to do next.
10160,170,0,20,INTJ,20,"<Yes>  I used to worry a lot during the process of getting a job. There is a side to worrying about problems that can only be known by encountering them first, whether this is the right job for this company."
10161,170,0,20,INTJ,21,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid troublesome tasks, so I don't really want to be a leader in a group. When responsibility is given, it is accompanied by annoyance because you have to act accordingly."
10162,170,0,20,INTJ,22,"<Yes>  I learned music or art as a hobby, even if not seriously, but I couldn¡¯t find any particular artistic talent or tendency."
10163,170,0,20,INTJ,23,<neutrality>  It is a better world when reason and emotion are harmonized. Emotions come first. Reason is right. I don't think so.
10164,170,0,20,INTJ,24,"<neutrality> It depends on the condition then. On days when you want to be too tired, rest first, and if you are in the condition to do housework first, it is better to do housework and rest."
10165,170,0,20,INTJ,25,"<Yes>  If you're arguing about a topic I'm interested in, I'm interested. However, it is not interesting if it is a simple quarrel rather than a constructive argument."
10166,170,0,20,INTJ,26,"<Yes>  I think it's important not to harm others in public places, so I try not to draw attention."
10167,170,0,20,INTJ,27,"<no>  I tend to have less emotional ups and downs, so my emotions don't change quickly. Feelings of sadness or joy do not last long and do not change rapidly."
10168,170,0,20,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  People who handle things inflexibly are unintentionally irritating. It's not good, especially when you face such a person while talking on the phone, but you can sigh."
10169,170,0,20,INTJ,29,"<no> If there is something I need to do, I tend to do it steadily, little by little, to achieve my goal. Because of the recent certification exam, I prepared by filling in the target amount little by little from a month ago."
10170,170,0,20,INTJ,30,"<Yes>  I am interested in having unrealistic fantasies or delusions, so I am interested in various people's views on the afterlife."
10171,170,0,20,INTJ,31,"<Yes>  Since I'm taking a break from dating, I have a strong desire to spend time with my lover rather than hanging out with friends."
10172,170,0,20,INTJ,32,"<no> If it's a topic I'm interested in, I don't think it's boring, I listen to others' opinions, and I actively express my opinions."
10173,170,0,20,INTJ,33,"<no>  I tend to judge based on my experience, so it would be difficult for me to sympathize with the life of a chaebol whose background is completely different from mine."
10174,170,0,20,INTJ,34,"<no>  I tend to come to conclusions and proceed with work, so I think that if I put it off until the end, even if I make a decision, I will not be satisfied."
10175,170,0,20,INTJ,35,"<neutrality>  Most of us don't think about it, but there are times when we think about some past decisions. It's mainly a relationship issue, but there are times when I rethink my decision, thinking if I did this in the past or if I didn't do this in the past."
10176,170,0,20,INTJ,36,"<no>  When I want to rest, I prefer to have time alone. Rather than relieving fatigue, I feel that parties and events accumulate fatigue."
10177,170,0,20,INTJ,37,<Yes>  prefer the act of going to an art museum and I like to receive visual stimulation by going to an art museum.
10178,170,0,20,INTJ,38,"<no>  If you are not a complete stranger, but have accumulated a certain amount of friendship, you do not feel difficulty in understanding the feelings because you understand part of the background and concerns of the person."
10179,170,0,20,INTJ,39,"<Yes>  It's not detailed, but I tend to decide what to do in the afternoon in a big frame. I think it is more efficient and good for time management."
10180,170,0,20,INTJ,40,"<neutrality>  Each situation is different, but when I think about my future life, I feel insecure. In other situations, I don't feel very anxious."
10181,170,0,20,INTJ,41,"<no>  I prefer to call rather than text, so I don't avoid it. Rather, they feel that communication is not smooth through text messages, so they prefer to communicate directly over the phone."
10182,170,0,20,INTJ,42,<no> It goes beyond trying to understand. Recognize that you are this kind of person and this kind of understanding person. I don't know if I need to understand other people's different opinions.
10183,170,0,20,INTJ,43,"<no>  Even in the Kakao Talk room, I don't talk to my friends first, so I don't communicate well with my friends. I think it's because I tend to rest alone at home when I'm resting."
10184,170,0,20,INTJ,44,"<no> If there is a setback to the plan, adjust accordingly. Recently, I planned to have a quick bite before work, but I wasn't as hungry as I thought, so I changed my plan to simply have a drink."
10185,170,0,20,INTJ,45,"<no>  There aren't many, but there are times when I regret things related to love. I think it's right to break up in my head, but there are often times when I regret the decision of the day even after a few years."
10186,170,0,20,INTJ,46,<Yes>  don't think deeply because I don't think it's a topic that will give you an answer. I tend to think about topics that interest me more.
10187,170,0,20,INTJ,47,"<no>  Try to control your emotions without being swayed by them. These days, there are times when I wonder if I¡¯m just controlling myself without venting my emotions."
10188,170,0,20,INTJ,48,"<no>  I don't give a face, but I don't even try to save face. Just stay still. It's because I don't know why to save face."
10201,171,1,20,ESTP,1,<neutrality>  I don't make new friends regularly. But I like to join new groups and meet new friends.
10202,171,1,20,ESTP,2,"<Yes>  I tend to spend a lot of time in contact with various interests through YouTube or broadcasting that introduces various topics. These days, I am interested in Korean history."
10203,171,1,20,ESTP,3,"<neutrality> If the person who is crying is close to me or if I sympathize with that person's situation, I also cry. However, I am not the type to sympathize with the feelings of people who feel that they are others."
10204,171,1,20,ESTP,4,"<Yes>  Even if it's not completely specific, it's easier mentally to think roughly, so I tend to make preparations."
10205,171,1,20,ESTP,5,"<Yes>  In the end, I try to keep my composure, thinking that I just have to do what I have to do step by step."
10206,171,1,20,ESTP,6,<Yes>  I prefer meeting new people through people I already know rather than introducing myself to completely new people.
10207,171,1,20,ESTP,7,<Yes>  I tend to start after I'm completely done because I think it's more efficient to do one thing at a time rather than doing several things at the same time.
10208,171,1,20,ESTP,8,"<no>  think I'm on the side with normal level emotions. I am moved by the parts that most people are moved by watching movies or dramas, but I don't shed tears."
10209,171,1,20,ESTP,9,"<neutrality>  I like to make a to-do list, but I don't do detailed planning or journaling."
10210,171,1,20,ESTP,10,<no>  I don't interpret minor mistakes as big because I think humans can make mistakes.
10211,171,1,20,ESTP,11,"<neutrality> Even though I'm nervous and worried at the beginning, I'm the type to have a good conversation in the end."
10212,171,1,20,ESTP,12,<no>  I want to know how others feel about anything from simple appreciation to deep interpretation. Then you can get a deeper understanding of the work.
10213,171,1,20,ESTP,13,"<Yes>  I don't ignore the emotional aspect, but I tend to try to solve it rationally. I hear evaluations that I often make sober decisions even around me."
10214,171,1,20,ESTP,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to get anxious when I don¡¯t have a general direction, but tight plans are frustrating, so I like to improvise within a big direction."
10215,171,1,20,ESTP,15,"<no>  I think I can't live alone in the world, so I tend to worry about relationships with others."
10216,171,1,20,ESTP,16,<neutrality>  I feel burdened doing activities with so many people I don¡¯t know. But I like activities with friendly people.
10217,171,1,20,ESTP,17,"<no>  Rather than an open ending, I prefer things that contain the thoughts and conclusions of the original author. I think about what happens after that, but I like that the ending itself is fixed."
10218,171,1,20,ESTP,18,"<no>  I'm not jealous of the success of others, but I think my success is more important and I feel more satisfied."
10219,171,1,20,ESTP,19,"<no>  Even if I want to do many things, I tend to prioritize, so I never knew what to do."
10220,171,1,20,ESTP,20,"<Yes>  I tend to worry a lot by nature, so I tend to worry about whether things are going well even when I¡¯m working."
10221,171,1,20,ESTP,21,"<Yes>  I feel burdened by taking responsibility and prefer to act freely, so I would like to avoid leadership roles."
10222,171,1,20,ESTP,22,<no>  I think I have an artistic side because I tend to be dexterous and enjoy making and gifting things.
10223,171,1,20,ESTP,23,"<no>  Reason can be efficient, but I don't think emotions should be overlooked because the world doesn't run on efficiency."
10224,171,1,20,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I like to finish chores first because if I don't finish them, I keep thinking that I have to work while taking a break."
10225,171,1,20,ESTP,25,<no>  hate seeing unproductive arguments. The reason for this is that most of us are more likely to stick to our own opinions rather than arguing for the better.
10226,171,1,20,ESTP,26,<Yes>  Likes to be gently mingled rather than attracting attention or being in the spotlight. I don't like being proactive.
10227,171,1,20,ESTP,27,"<neutrality>  I'm often moody, but I've never had my emotions change very quickly."
10228,171,1,20,ESTP,28,"<Yes> When I'm working, I tend to get frustrated when I see people doing multiple things at once. The inefficient use of traffic lines is particularly irritating."
10229,171,1,20,ESTP,29,"<neutrality>  Originally, I like to finish things quickly, but lately I tend to procrastinate a bit because I'm mentally tired."
10230,171,1,20,ESTP,30,"<no>  I used to be interested in it when I was younger, but I'm not interested anymore. It's because I don't think it's helpful to live faithfully in the present."
10231,171,1,20,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  I need time alone, but I think I also need time with others. I especially like spending time with old friends these days."
10232,171,1,20,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  I think realistic discussions are more important, so I tend to get frustrated with stories that are too theoretical. In particular, it is frustrating to see discussions without reality in the economic or social fields."
10233,171,1,20,ESTP,33,"<neutrality>  It is easy to sympathize if you have a human crush, but it is impossible if you do not like it. Just as I sympathize with the hunger problem in Africa, but I cannot sympathize with male Muslim refugees."
10234,171,1,20,ESTP,34,<Yes>  I tend to make decisions more comprehensively by reflecting various situations.
10235,171,1,20,ESTP,35,"<no> I've already made a decision, but I tend to think about it over and over again. That way, I think we can make better decisions through feedback."
10236,171,1,20,ESTP,36,"<no>  I like spending time together, but I need some alone time to relax. I really like going for walks by myself these days."
10237,171,1,20,ESTP,37,"<Yes>  I like going to quiet art galleries. I like the atmosphere of art museums, and I also like seeing and appreciating art works."
10238,171,1,20,ESTP,38,"<neutrality>  I¡¯m the type of person who tries to be modest, so I understand the emotions expressed by others, but I don¡¯t completely sympathize with them. I recently saw a friend being moved by a streamer singing a song, and I thought I could be moved, but I wasn't impressed."
10239,171,1,20,ESTP,39,"<neutrality>  I hate making detailed plans, but I like organizing what needs to be done."
10240,171,1,20,ESTP,40,"<no>  Rather than having other triggers, I am naturally more worried, so I often feel minor insecurities."
10241,171,1,20,ESTP,41,"<no>  When I have a problem, I like to call and get it resolved quickly. Unless the waiting time on the phone is long and it takes longer than asking in writing."
10242,171,1,20,ESTP,42,"<no>  I respect other people's opinions, so I don't spend time understanding them. Of course, I tend to let it go that way."
10243,171,1,20,ESTP,43,"<Yes>  When I feel like I miss you, I tend to contact you first and ask to meet you in order to spend time with my friends."
10244,171,1,20,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  There was a setback to the plan because a certain order was missing, but we tried to solve it."
10245,171,1,20,ESTP,45,"<Yes>  Feeling frustrated with the reality these days, I often regret the choice of a time that could be an inflection point."
10246,171,1,20,ESTP,46,<Yes> We don't think deeply because we can get caught up in abstract things that we can't draw conclusions from.
10247,171,1,20,ESTP,47,"<neutrality>  I respond emotionally to my relatives, but I tend to control my emotions as much as possible when it comes to public matters."
10248,171,1,20,ESTP,48,"<Yes>  For the sake of a relationship, I tend to care about face rather than pointing out things directly. It may be good for a short-term mood or effect, but I think it's better to pass it as good in the long run."
10261,172,0,40,ISTP,1,"<no>  It's okay to have a few good friends. If you keep making new friends, you may lose a real precious friend."
10262,172,0,40,ISTP,2,"<Yes>  There are too many interests. RC cars, bond investment, car tuning, foreign stock investment, phone replacement, etc."
10263,172,0,40,ISTP,3,<no>  I don't care why you cry at all. I don't want to pay attention to useless things.
10264,172,0,40,ISTP,4,"<no>  make mistakes because I don't know what I did is a mistake. I can't really make a countermeasure, and I just keep checking and checking again and there is no answer."
10265,172,0,40,ISTP,5,"<Yes>  After investing in stocks, the loss rate increased, but when I was convinced that I had come to the bottom, I continued to hold on and bought more and eventually made a profit."
10266,172,0,40,ISTP,6,<Yes>  Talk to people you already know without first introducing yourself to new people. It's much more convenient and natural.
10267,172,0,40,ISTP,7,"<no> Some things have an order and some things don't, so it's good to change the order to suit the situation."
10268,172,0,40,ISTP,8,<neutrality>  I'm not sure how sentimental I am. I guess it depends on the situation.
10269,172,0,40,ISTP,9,"<neutrality>  In some cases, work is done according to plan. I tend to use the KakaoTalk calendar function to plan only the necessary parts."
10270,172,0,40,ISTP,10,"<no>  Mistakes can always be there. If you doubt yourself that you made one mistake, you can do nothing."
10271,172,0,40,ISTP,11,<Yes>  Just do it. None of this is difficult. How many difficult things are there in the world?
10272,172,0,40,ISTP,12,"<no>  I have no interest in art at all, so I have nothing to discuss with anyone."
10273,172,0,40,ISTP,13,<neutrality>  It changes depending on the situation. I have rarely talked about feelings and reason with the people around me.
10274,172,0,40,ISTP,14,"<no>  Improvisation always causes more problems, so I try not to do it."
10275,172,0,40,ISTP,15,<no>  don't care what other people think of me There is no special occasion.
10276,172,0,40,ISTP,16,"<no>  I'm not interested in group activities at all, and I hate it more because of Corona 19 these days."
10277,172,0,40,ISTP,17,"<neutrality>  It's fun if you don't know the ending. Among the things I've seen lately, I liked Man in the Dark 2."
10278,172,0,40,ISTP,18,<no>  Not like that. I think I need to be successful to be able to help people around me
10279,172,0,40,ISTP,19,"<Yes>  Sometimes, when you are trying to do several things at the same time, you forget which one to do first."
10280,172,0,40,ISTP,20,"<no>  Even if things go wrong, I am confident that if I work harder to overcome them, I will do well."
10281,172,0,40,ISTP,21,"<Yes>  No matter how well you do, you get scolded by a certain force, and you hate it because you get scolded even more if you don't."
10282,172,0,40,ISTP,22,<Yes>  I don't know exactly the standards and definitions of art. I don't even know where I belong.
10283,172,0,40,ISTP,23,<no>  Both emotions and reason are important. Either way there will always be pros and cons.
10284,172,0,40,ISTP,24,"<neutrality>  don't care much whether I'm taking a break or doing housework, and I don't know what's more important."
10285,172,0,40,ISTP,25,"<no>  When you see an argument in Korea, most of them raise their voices and only make their own voices, and then end without a conclusion."
10286,172,0,40,ISTP,26,<Yes>  I think most of the situations where there is nothing good for me by attracting other people's attention.
10287,172,0,40,ISTP,27,<no>  I tend to try not to create situations where emotions can change quickly.
10288,172,0,40,ISTP,28,<no> It is difficult to say whether it is efficient or not because people have different ideas.
10289,172,0,40,ISTP,29,"<no>  If there is something I must do, mark it on my calendar and try to solve it in advance."
10290,172,0,40,ISTP,30,"<no>  No matter how much I think about it, the afterlife doesn't exist, so I don't feel the need to be interested in it."
10291,172,0,40,ISTP,31,"<no>  I don't like noisy things, so I usually like to spend time alone rather than meeting many people."
10292,172,0,40,ISTP,32,<Yes> Theory-centered discussions often do not come up with solutions and are often at a standstill.
10293,172,0,40,ISTP,33,"<neutrality>  If your background is very different from mine, it may be difficult to relate to you, but if you have a close relationship, it will be different."

10297,172,0,40,ISTP,37,"<no>  I'm not very interested in appreciating art works, so I don't have a chance to see them."
10298,172,0,40,ISTP,38,<no>  It's hard to understand when the other person keeps repeating himself and ignoring my baby.
10299,172,0,40,ISTP,39,"<no>  Whether for business or personal, I don't always plan to live, but I tend to plan only the important things on a daily basis."
10300,172,0,40,ISTP,40,"<Yes> I'm not impatient, and I rarely feel anxious."
10301,172,0,40,ISTP,41,"<Yes>  I don't like talking directly to people, so I try to avoid it whenever possible."
10302,172,0,40,ISTP,42,"<no>  There can always be opinions different from mine, and I don't try to understand them."
10303,172,0,40,ISTP,43,"<no>  If it's a friend, it doesn't matter where you ask to meet at any time. I can do it, or the other person can do it first."
10304,172,0,40,ISTP,44,<no>  tend to try my best to find a way to make up for the setbacks.
10305,172,0,40,ISTP,45,"<no>  I do have it, but even if I regret it, nothing will change, and even now I try my best not to make any mistakes."
10306,172,0,40,ISTP,46,<Yes>  We cannot even think about existence and life because we do not even know how humans began to exist on Earth.
10307,172,0,40,ISTP,47,"<no>  I try to control my emotions according to the situation, and it doesn't matter how people around me evaluate me."
10308,172,0,40,ISTP,48,"<neutrality>  I tend to do that to people I am close with, but I try to follow the rules with others."
10321,173,1,40,ESFJ,1,<Yes>  Because making friends with new people energizes and gives joy to my life.
10322,173,1,40,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, I am learning about an instrument called ukulele. The sound of the ukulele, which I recently heard in a hands-on class, was very attractive."
10323,173,1,40,ESFJ,3,"<Yes>  I am the type to feel the emotions of others well, so I often cry with tears next to someone who is crying. It seems to become one with that person's heart."
10324,173,1,40,ESFJ,4,"<no>  When I think about things going wrong, I tend to worry and think a lot, so I tend to just face things with a positive thought that things will go well."
10325,173,1,40,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  I've had interviews where I was very nervous. In front of me, a person I had never seen before had a hard face and looked at me with an expression as if he could see right through me. I was not nervous at all and was able to finish well."
10326,173,1,40,ESFJ,6,"<Yes>  In a space where there are only new people, I tend to talk first or approach with an active attitude, but in a place where there are people I know, I prefer to have a conversation with my acquaintances. It's because the process of re-aligning something and finding a common topic feels a bit cumbersome and cumbersome."
10327,173,1,40,ESFJ,7,<Yes>  like to finish one thing and then start another. This is because the unfinished work in the middle keeps bothering me and it hinders me from starting a new job.
10328,173,1,40,ESFJ,8,<Yes>  It's sentimental. This is because it feels more natural to act as the heart moves rather than to judge and plan something rationally.
10329,173,1,40,ESFJ,9,"<no>  don't like making plans. The basic framework is set, but the details are handled immediately according to the condition and schedule at the time. I don't write a diary, but I only set the framework of things to do in simple memos."
10330,173,1,40,ESFJ,10,"<no>  am tolerant of myself. At that moment, I feel a bit upset and blame myself for my mistakes, but I tend to justify them and forget about them quickly. A few days ago, I had a small car accident due to my mistake. I was upset at first, but I remember thinking that no one could have avoided it in a situation like this and quickly forgot it."
10331,173,1,40,ESFJ,11,"<no> It's not difficult to start a conversation. Starting with the weather or everyday stories, once you find a common topic, it's not difficult to continue the conversation from then on. At the ukulele gathering that started not too long ago, there was a time when they were the first people I met, but they easily talked about the common topic of ukulele."
10332,173,1,40,ESFJ,12,"<no>  I am not very interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. During discussions, unnecessary wars of nerves or arguing occur, but I don't like such situations."
10333,173,1,40,ESFJ,13,"<no>  I tend to follow my emotions. It's not easier than I thought to make a rational decision, and I remember that it was always right to do what I was led by my heart at the time. People around me judge me as an emotional person."
10334,173,1,40,ESFJ,14,"<neutrality>  set the basic framework, but I tend to change it spontaneously depending on the situation. If I insist on my plan in a situation where my condition or circumstances change, I actually have less efficiency and more experiences that I am not satisfied with."
10335,173,1,40,ESFJ,15,<no>  I tend to think and care a lot about how I look. This is because he is a good person to everyone and has a lot of desire to be recognized.
10336,173,1,40,ESFJ,16,"<Yes>  enjoy doing group activities. As I get older, it is very unfortunate that opportunities for group activities have decreased, and I am looking for opportunities to do various group activities such as tug-of-war or group jumping rope at events such as sports competitions."
10337,173,1,40,ESFJ,17,<no>  I like books and movies that always have a happy ending. I tend to cover up books or movies halfway through if the ending itself is unpleasant or sad.
10338,173,1,40,ESFJ,18,"<no>  believe that success is achieved by oneself. The most important thing in life is me, so it's important to work for your own success first."
10339,173,1,40,ESFJ,19,"<no>  I don't have a lot of things I want to do or I'm not passionate about, but I don't have many interests. When something interests me, I tend to act right away and learn about it."
10340,173,1,40,ESFJ,20,"<no>  tend not to worry. Because the things you worry about don't actually work out or are problematic, and you make yourself hard while waiting, you cast a spell with self-suggestions that it'll work out."
10341,173,1,40,ESFJ,21,"<neutrality>  I don't want to be a leader, but I like to act as a leader in front of people when there is no one who wants to be a leader. It's because they're uncomfortable with the discomfort or confusion of a leaderless situation."
10342,173,1,40,ESFJ,22,<Yes>  don't think there is any artistic inclination at all. This is a story that my art teacher told me about when I was in school.
10343,173,1,40,ESFJ,23,"<no>  I believe that the world is not about calculating and living like tapping on a calculator. I am sure that if we live while valuing people's feelings, the world will become a warmer and better place to live."
10344,173,1,40,ESFJ,24,<Yes>  It's because the break time with a cup of coffee after finishing all the housework makes me happy and comfortable.
10345,173,1,40,ESFJ,25,"<no>  He doesn't like arguments with me, and he doesn't like arguments with other loves either. Because the raw conversation between people makes me uncomfortable."
10346,173,1,40,ESFJ,26,"<Yes>  It's embarrassing, but I like to be in the spotlight and receive attention. I think so because I tend to be the main character in any gathering and enjoy talking in front of others."
10347,173,1,40,ESFJ,27,"<no>  tend to keep my composure. I think that's because he doesn't have many emotional ups and downs and even if he gets angry, he quickly calms down."
10348,173,1,40,ESFJ,28,"<neutrality>  You must feel frustrated. However, I tend to try to see the person's strengths, and in that case, there were many cases where there were clearly other things to learn that I didn't have."
10349,173,1,40,ESFJ,29,"<no>  Do what needs to be done. I hate being psychologically stressed and think that comfort is the most important thing, so I do the work as soon as I receive it."
10350,173,1,40,ESFJ,30,"<neutrality>  There are many interesting cases, but there are many questions that are too absurd and nonsensical, or they are connected to religion, so I don't enjoy it."
10351,173,1,40,ESFJ,31,"<neutrality>  Usually, I prefer to spend time with other people, but these days, I feel comfortable and enjoy spending time alone doing nothing."
10352,173,1,40,ESFJ,32,<Yes> Original stories are boring and uninteresting. Interest is drawn when the discussion is related to real life or on a topic you are familiar with.
10353,173,1,40,ESFJ,33,"<Yes>  Even if they come from different backgrounds, they easily feel empathy for other people's feelings and assimilate. I remember hearing the story of a Korean-Chinese I met a while ago and talking about it."
10354,173,1,40,ESFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to be indecisive, so I think about the decision until the end and decide at the last minute."
10355,173,1,40,ESFJ,35,"<Yes>  I try not to think about it intentionally and not to regret it. It's because when you think about it, you only have regrets and regrets about the road you haven't taken."
10356,173,1,40,ESFJ,36,"<neutrality>  It's good to have time alone, but noisy time with fun people also makes me work."
10357,173,1,40,ESFJ,37,<Yes>  Seeing art galleries or beautiful works of art makes me happy and in a good mood.
10358,173,1,40,ESFJ,38,"<no>  It's easy for me to understand other people's emotions because I tend to assimilate or feel them well. For example, even if the other person doesn't explain the current mood or condition, if you look at the situation, you can understand and feel the person's feelings."
10359,173,1,40,ESFJ,39,"<no>  Rather than living by plan, there is a basic framework, but it is comfortable to live freely and spontaneously."
10360,173,1,40,ESFJ,40,"<no>  I am naturally positive and simple, so I don't feel insecure. It's something I was born with, but as I grew up, I thought a lot of positive thoughts for myself, so that naturally became my image."
10361,173,1,40,ESFJ,41,"<neutrality>  don't hate making phone calls per se, but I don't prefer long calls because I feel like having a meaningless conversation on a long phone call takes away my energy. But rather than KakaoTalk, I definitely like making phone calls."
10362,173,1,40,ESFJ,42,"<no> We discuss the opinions of people with different opinions for a while, and if they don't match, we don't try to match or understand them. Just accept it as a characteristic or personality of that person. For example, when someone else tells me they don't like my favorite restaurant, I tend to admit and accept the difference rather than insisting on my opinion."
10363,173,1,40,ESFJ,43,"<no>  When we meet, we have a lot of fun and play well, but I'm not the type to contact them first to ask them to hang out."
10364,173,1,40,ESFJ,44,"<no>  If the planned situation changes, replan what you can do in the current situation and set a new schedule. There was a time when a trip I had planned recently was disrupted due to traffic congestion, but rather than trying to move as originally planned, I remember planning and traveling to a new destination that I can go to now."
10365,173,1,40,ESFJ,45,"<no> Mistakes are not things that can be undone by rethinking, so I try not to regret it even intentionally."
10366,173,1,40,ESFJ,46,<no>  Because I don't like to think seriously and think seriously about difficult or profound topics.
10367,173,1,40,ESFJ,47,"<no>  I tend to keep my composure well, so I don't have ups and downs of emotions, and I don't have big fluctuations in my emotions. I am always evaluated as a person with no emotional ups and downs, both in my eyes and in those around me."
10368,173,1,40,ESFJ,48,<no>  I think it's important to clearly admit one's fault and receive an apology for the wrong part. This is because it is more important not to repeat the same mistakes or mistakes than to save face.
10381,174,1,30,ENFJ,1,"<no> I've made other friends through small groups, but it didn't last long, so I don't recommend it. I hate friends who want to know for a long time and only look for them when needed."
10382,174,1,30,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, the era is the AI era, so I'm studying to make big data while watching YouTube. The reason is that it is an era where you just need to earn a lot of money, so I have a personality that will do anything that makes money hotly."
10383,174,1,30,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  I think if the other person talks while crying about any emotion, she will become immersed in that emotion and shed tears. So I feel like I'm going to feel very depressed."
10384,174,1,30,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  Depending on the situation, I get the feeling that it will be like this or that. For example, if you are in charge of a job where you shouldn't make mistakes, it's because there are too many people who think and try to do it by themselves."
10385,174,1,30,ENFJ,5,"<Yes>  I work at a hospital, and I disagree with the teachers every day. Still, I'm going to explain the proper job again. Even so, there are cases where they don't listen to me, who have a long career, and do as they please, so there are many times when the director always says something."
10386,174,1,30,ENFJ,6,"<Yes>  mainly say hello to close colleagues and close friends. The reason is that new people are good, but the people around me helped me a lot and I felt close to them first."
10387,174,1,30,ENFJ,7,"<Yes>  When I finish one thing, I do another. The reason is that when I do too many things, I really hate the feeling of doing other things rather than focusing on one thing."
10388,174,1,30,ENFJ,8,"<no> I'm not very far, but I think I'm sentimental depending on the situation. The reason is that I'm not sentimental about anything every time."
10389,174,1,30,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  I plan and work, because I tend to write down what's happening next month on my phone calendar every day."
10390,174,1,30,ENFJ,10,"<no>  I am a person who makes no mistakes. The reason is that I made too many mistakes in the past, and the memory of being scolded was left as a trauma, so even if I made a habit of checking again, I didn't make any mistakes."
10391,174,1,30,ENFJ,11,<Yes>  I have a lively personality and I think I have the ability to talk first. The reason is because I talk to people who are similar to me or who have the same hobbies.
10392,174,1,30,ENFJ,12,"<no>  I was interested in art when I was young, but now I'm not interested at all."
10393,174,1,30,ENFJ,13,"<Yes> When I was young, I treated people with emotion rather than reason. But all that came back was a wound. After becoming an adult, I now treat people rationally, so I believe in people and my trust level has increased."
10394,174,1,30,ENFJ,14,"<Yes>  Since I'm an office worker, there are many cases where I couldn't do it when I wanted to, so there are more cases where I improvise. There are four half-days a month, but I don't know when to go, so I decide according to the day."
10395,174,1,30,ENFJ,15,<no> I'm not at all interested in how others see me. I'm not even worried. The reason is that I get tired the moment I think about each person.
10396,174,1,30,ENFJ,16,"<no>  I don't like group activities. The reason is that I liked exercise, but there are cases where I can't even go to the indoor gym because of Corona, so it's better to be quiet alone from then on."
10397,174,1,30,ENFJ,17,"<Yes>  I like movies that wish they were like this. The reason is that the time I watched the movie from the beginning is not a waste, and unlike what I thought, if it's disappointing, I won't watch other works. Recently, it's a cartoon, but I saw it on YouTube called ""Recruit"". It came out as a drama and I enjoyed watching it."
10398,174,1,30,ENFJ,18,"<Yes>  believe that when others do well, I will do well too. The reason is because I think that if that person learns from me, others will learn from that person as well."
10399,174,1,30,ENFJ,19,"<no>  My interests are clearly defined. As now, I check the crowdworks every day to see if there is anything to work on."
10400,174,1,30,ENFJ,20,<no>  I don't have much to worry about. The reason is because I have worried a lot in the past and have bad memories of suffering alone.
10401,174,1,30,ENFJ,21,"<no>  I have dreamed of becoming a leader since I was a child. I have so many responsibilities right now, so it's daunting, but maybe because I have a strong sense of responsibility, it's fun to take responsibility for my work."
10402,174,1,30,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I have artistic inclinations. The reason is that you can draw a picture or create a design as you think. Banner advertisements, hospital closures, etc. are also made into posters."
10403,174,1,30,ENFJ,23,"<Yes>  I think the world would be a better place if reason was more important than emotion. The reason is that if people live emotionally, depression tends to increase these days, so I think suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, etc. can happen a lot and become more serious."
10404,174,1,30,ENFJ,24,"<Yes> I'm a person who wants to live in a clean environment, whether it's around or at home, so I start by cleaning when I go home after work. The reason is that the workplace is a hospital, and there is also a corona, so it seems to have changed more neatly."
10405,174,1,30,ENFJ,25,"<no>  I'm not really interested. The reason is that when an argument occurs, it only leads to a fight, so I don't even want to hear it."
10406,174,1,30,ENFJ,26,"<Yes>  I look around and I'm not the type to draw attention to myself. The reason is, in my opinion, because there are too many servants, so I don't want to look like that."
10407,174,1,30,ENFJ,27,"<Yes>  My emotions come and go. For example, when I was working, I felt good when I did a good job when I was teaching the teachers, but if they suddenly let them do their own thing, I immediately lose my temper and get a mark on my face."
10408,174,1,30,ENFJ,28,"<no> Since there are many people, I think I will have no idea rather than annoyance. For example, I think it will be like this because I rate that person highly, but because it may not be, I do not say that the person is efficient or not."
10409,174,1,30,ENFJ,29,"<no>  I don't delay what I have to do, I do it right away when I think of it. It's been that way lately too."
10410,174,1,30,ENFJ,30,<Yes>  This is because the afterlife I think is a world that no living person can experience.
10411,174,1,30,ENFJ,31,"<no>  Even these days, I think a lot about wanting to be alone. Because it's noisy and it's good to be in a group, but it's better to be alone and not pay attention to yourself comfortably."
10412,174,1,30,ENFJ,32,"<no> I'm not really interested in talking about the debate itself. A few days ago, when I was talking about politics and society with my family, I thought I didn't want to do it very much because I was fighting and my voice was getting higher and I couldn't have a conversation because I only had strong opinions."
10413,174,1,30,ENFJ,33,"<no>  My environment No one knows the background of my life. I think the people who listen to me express it in words will know about it, but not all. Because emotions are different."
10414,174,1,30,ENFJ,34,"<no>  I'm the type of person who gets things done right the way I think. We do not delay work, we solve it on the spot."
10415,174,1,30,ENFJ,35,"<Yes>  I'm not giving a second thought to my decision. The reason is that thinking again means thinking about it, so you can change your mind."
10416,174,1,30,ENFJ,36,"<no>  I want to spend more time alone. I want to take a half-body bath by myself, watch TV, and live a filtering life. I think it relieves stress and relieves fatigue. They do that even today."
10417,174,1,30,ENFJ,37,"<no>  When I was young, I went to art museums for vacation homework. It didn't fit my hobbies or even my filtered life."
10418,174,1,30,ENFJ,38,"<no>  I'm good at paying attention to what people say, so I understand how they feel. For example, in the case of trouble counseling, I knew exactly what to do and how I felt, and I consulted and told me."
10419,174,1,30,ENFJ,39,<no>  don't plan every day. Because sometimes you can't and sometimes you don't.
10420,174,1,30,ENFJ,40,<no>  I am always anxious. I didn't ride it. It seems that things are not good for this and that.
10421,174,1,30,ENFJ,41,<no>  I do it over the phone whenever needed. The reason is that he has an impatient personality.
10422,174,1,30,ENFJ,42,"<no>  I'm not the type to waste time with people I don't communicate with. If you don't agree on a topic, you're the type to move on."
10423,174,1,30,ENFJ,43,"<Yes>  I even spontaneously ask close friends I haven't seen in a long time to meet up. It may or may not be necessary, but they often call first to heal. It's because I don't have much time."
10424,174,1,30,ENFJ,44,"<no>  In the past, I put a lot of effort into making sure my plans didn't go wrong. But now, even if I try to keep my plans from going wrong, I have a hard time unless I'm alone, so I'm the type of person who gives up quickly."
10425,174,1,30,ENFJ,45,"<no>  I don't think about the past. These days, I worry about what will happen in the future."
10426,174,1,30,ENFJ,46,"<Yes>  I'm busy living and there are many things I have to do, but I don't want to think about all of life."
10427,174,1,30,ENFJ,47,"<no>  I know how to control my emotions. When a situation arises around you and you tell it after solving it, you often hear the words, ""You solved it well."""
10428,174,1,30,ENFJ,48,<no>  I don't save face when the other person is wrong. I don't know why I have to live.
10441,175,0,40,ENFP,1,"<neutrality>  I don't make new friends regularly. However, the approaching friend does not hesitate. Each of my friends has their strengths and weaknesses, so I try to make many friends."
10442,175,0,40,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  In my free time, I like to acquire licenses as a hobby. I have all my licenses, and I think there are over 30 types of licenses."
10443,175,0,40,ENFP,3,"<neutrality>  I don't want to cry just because I see someone else crying. You will want to cry when the situation is right. For example, when a close friend is having a hard time."
10444,175,0,40,ENFP,4,"<Yes>  I tend to have a lot of contingency plans in case things go wrong. Of course, it would be nice if it was solved at once, but if not, you have to set up a second best plan to make things go smoothly."
10445,175,0,40,ENFP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. When taking the certification exam, you need to keep your composure as much as possible so that you can do well."
10446,175,0,40,ENFP,6,<Yes>  I don't introduce myself first. It's because someone you already know is comfortable and familiar.
10447,175,0,40,ENFP,7,"<neutrality>  There are times when I finish one project and then start another, but if I have a lot to work on, there are times when I have several things going on."
10448,175,0,40,ENFP,8,<Yes>  I think I change emotionally as I get older. There are times when I shed tears while watching a drama.
10449,175,0,40,ENFP,9,<neutrality>  I like making plans. But I don't use diaries or electronic tools. Plans are often improvised.
10450,175,0,40,ENFP,10,"<no>  think everyone can make small mistakes. I never question my ability or knowledge. When you take the certification exam, you may pass, but if you fail, you can try again."
10451,175,0,40,ENFP,11,"<neutrality>  I think it's different each time. If you look familiar, it's easy to have a conversation, but if you're blunt, it's not easy to start a conversation."
10452,175,0,40,ENFP,12,<Yes>  I am not interested in discussing different interpretations of a work of art. I'm not interested in art. I haven't had a chance to see anything like that since I was young.
10453,175,0,40,ENFP,13,<no>  Emotions generally take precedence over reason. It seems that the evaluation of the surroundings is also like that.
10454,175,0,40,ENFP,14,"<Yes>  Rather than planning a schedule for the day, I do a lot of improvisation. I don't think I'm going to stick to it because I make a plan."
10455,175,0,40,ENFP,15,"<neutrality>  I'm not worried about who I will look like, but I'm curious. I give lectures and I am curious about what students think of me."
10456,175,0,40,ENFP,16,"<no>  I participated in group activities a lot when I was young, but as I get older, the opportunities to do group activities seem to decrease."
10457,175,0,40,ENFP,17,"<Yes>  I don't read books, but I watch movies often. There are a lot of interesting movies coming out these days. Recently, I watched Top Gun Young-ho, and I was moved. It's not easy to save others even by sacrificing yourself, but I wonder if it would be the same even if I were in that situation."
10458,175,0,40,ENFP,18,"<neutrality>  I think it's different each time. I don't feel satisfied with helping others succeed unconditionally, but I want to contribute to helping others succeed. First of all, I think I should do well."
10459,175,0,40,ENFP,19,"<neutrality>  You do have a lot of interests. As acquiring certification is my hobby, I am interested in all certifications. But if I choose to, I tend to do it to the end."
10460,175,0,40,ENFP,20,<no>  think things could go wrong. Wouldn't it be too hard if I worried about it every time?
10461,175,0,40,ENFP,21,"<neutrality>  I don't want to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group. However, I don't want to play the role of a leader by looking around."
10462,175,0,40,ENFP,22,<no>  I consider myself artistically inclined. Especially because I love music so much. I also like to play instruments.
10463,175,0,40,ENFP,23,<neutrality>  think it might be different from time to time. I think there should be both emotion and reason. Wouldn't it have been too harsh if only rationality was emphasized?
10464,175,0,40,ENFP,24,"<Yes>  Finish work first and then rest before taking a break. When I'm taking a break, I feel uncomfortable if my work isn't over. It's more comfortable when you're done and rested."
10465,175,0,40,ENFP,25,"<no>  don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. By nature, he hates arguing. I don't like arguing with myself."
10466,175,0,40,ENFP,26,"<no>  You want to get other people's attention. I like to appear in front of many people. For example, singing in public."
10467,175,0,40,ENFP,27,"<Yes>  Emotions seem to change very quickly. Even if you're angry, if you quickly forget it, you'll be happy."
10468,175,0,40,ENFP,28,"<neutrality>  I think some people are not efficient. Because each person has different abilities. But if it's too inefficient, I'll be angry. For example, I think it is inefficient to focus too much on theory while studying for certification."
10469,175,0,40,ENFP,29,"<no>  We seldom procrastinate on what needs to be done. Doing what needs to be done makes me feel comfortable. If you focus on one thing, you will do it all the way."
10470,175,0,40,ENFP,30,"<neutrality>  To be honest, it seems like there is an afterlife or not, and I'm not sure."
10471,175,0,40,ENFP,31,"<neutrality>  It seems different from time to time. I like to spend time with other people, but I also enjoy spending time alone."
10472,175,0,40,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  I am not interested in theory-oriented discussions. To be honest, I don't like discussions very much. I feel like you're only making your point."
10473,175,0,40,ENFP,33,"<neutrality>  It can be different depending on what kind of background it is. For example, I don't think it's easy to relate to the backgrounds of chaebols."
10474,175,0,40,ENFP,34,"<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly. If you think about it too much, it's harder to make a decision. I think the sooner you decide, the better."
10475,175,0,40,ENFP,35,"<Yes>  I do not reconsider the decisions I have already made. The more I think about it, the more I think about it, and the more I think about it, the less things work."
10476,175,0,40,ENFP,36,"<neutrality>  I like to spend time alone and I like to unwind at parties and events. These days, I spend a lot of time alone."
10477,175,0,40,ENFP,37,"<no>  I am not very interested in museums or works of art. Ever since I was little, I wasn't interested in this."
10478,175,0,40,ENFP,38,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it's hard to understand other people's feelings, but generally I think I understand other people's feelings."
10479,175,0,40,ENFP,39,"<no>  I don't plan what to do every day. I tend to act spontaneously. Even if you plan it, it doesn't always follow."
10480,175,0,40,ENFP,40,"<Yes>  I rarely feel anxious. Since I was young, I have a positive disposition, so I don't feel insecure."
10481,175,0,40,ENFP,41,<neutrality>  I think it might be different for each person you talk to. I want to talk to people close to me and avoid people who are uncomfortable with me.
10482,175,0,40,ENFP,42,"<neutrality>  It depends. I try to understand other opinions, but I don't spend much time on absurd opinions."
10483,175,0,40,ENFP,43,"<Yes>  I always call first. At least once a week, I call first to ask for a drink."
10484,175,0,40,ENFP,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback to the plan, they try to improvise and quickly return to the plan. I think the temporary response is quick."
10485,175,0,40,ENFP,45,<no>  I think anyone can make mistakes. I'm not good at regretting. I will do other things when I regret it.
10486,175,0,40,ENFP,46,"<Yes>  I tend not to think deeply. No matter how much you think about it, it won't work, and you don't think too much about it."
10487,175,0,40,ENFP,47,"<neutrality> When I was young, I tended to be swayed by my emotions, but as I got older, I seem to be able to control my emotions. People around me think so too."
10488,175,0,40,ENFP,48,"<neutrality>  It depends on the circumstances. Sometimes it saves face, but not if the other person doesn't acknowledge it."
10501,176,1,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  I don't seem to make new friends on purpose. As you get older, making new friends can feel tiring."
10502,176,1,40,INFJ,2,"<no> Rather than exploring a variety of interests, I set aside time for exercise or just relaxation by myself. I've been into swimming lately."
10503,176,1,40,INFJ,3,<Yes>  There are many times when I have empathy and cry together without even realizing it. I feel like the other person's situation is my situation
10504,176,1,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to think of alternatives, if not multiple countermeasures. It's because I want it to go smoothly without panicking in case you don't know."
10505,176,1,40,INFJ,5,<no>  I tend to get a little anxious and my heart rate quickens when I'm under pressure. I recently felt sick and my heart beat faster and my fever increased as I wondered if I would be able to finish my work by the deadline.
10506,176,1,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  When I meet people for the first time, I tend to be very shy and shy, so it is comfortable to talk with familiar people."
10507,176,1,40,INFJ,7,"<Yes>  If you work on multiple projects at the same time, you may lose concentration and make mistakes, so I tend to work on another project after one project is finished."
10508,176,1,40,INFJ,8,"<Yes>  While talking with other people, there are times when you suddenly become excited or upset, as if you were in my situation, and the other person is more embarrassed."
10509,176,1,40,INFJ,9,"<neutrality>  I don't write a diary by making a plan or making a list of everything, but when it comes to my work, I tend to plan and proceed accurately. When I travel, I sometimes plan well, but sometimes I just go without a plan when I want to leave."
10510,176,1,40,INFJ,10,"<no>  Being human, I think anyone can make small mistakes. However, rather than doubting one's ability or knowledge by mistake, experience the mistake and consider it an opportunity to improve oneself without repeating the same mistake next time."
10511,176,1,40,INFJ,11,"<no> The more interested you are, the more cautious and burdensome you are. I tend to approach that person after getting some help from the people around me and understanding that person for a certain amount of time."
10512,176,1,40,INFJ,12,"<Yes>  Rather than discussing various interpretations, I tend to acknowledge that each person differs in how they see and feel a work of art, and accept the various interpretations as they are."
10513,176,1,40,INFJ,13,"<no>  tend to follow emotions more than reason. In any situation, even if it is necessary for me rationally, I don't seem to choose it if my heart doesn't follow. I hear that a lot from friends and family too."
10514,176,1,40,INFJ,14,"<no>  I tend to work on a planned schedule rather than improvising. While doing what you have planned, you are reluctant to have your plans go wrong due to someone's sudden, impromptu suggestion."
10515,176,1,40,INFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to help others as friends, family, and co-workers and hope to be a better person. Because the world is a world where many people live together."
10516,176,1,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  When I was young, it was fun to meet and share with many people through group activities, but as I get older, I don't like going to places where there are many people, and I feel tired and tired easily from working with many people."
10517,176,1,40,INFJ,17,<no>  I like books and movies with open endings that end more precisely than anyone can interpret. Because open endings sometimes feel frustrating.
10518,176,1,40,INFJ,18,"<no>  Of course, it is rewarding to help others succeed, and the satisfaction is great, but it is judged that the satisfaction will be greater when one's own success is the foundation."
10519,176,1,40,INFJ,19,"<no>  I don't have very diverse interests, so I don't know what to do. Recently, I've been interested in swimming again, so I'm trying to find a stroke that suits me."
10520,176,1,40,INFJ,20,"<neutrality>  Very occasionally, I was worried that I would go wrong because of a mistake. I remember hitting the wrong key while working on the computer, so I wondered if I had ever made that mistake again."
10521,176,1,40,INFJ,21,<Yes>  This is because the leadership role is so overwhelming because it encompasses everyone in the organization and always comes with great responsibility.
10522,176,1,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  I am not good at artistic things, but I am interested in artistic things, so I often go to exhibitions, musicals, and theater performances, and like to learn pottery, art, and crafts."
10523,176,1,40,INFJ,23,"<Yes>  I wonder if it would have been a better world if reason had been given more importance than emotion rather than a world where reason alone existed. I think it can be biased towards emotions, disturbing one's composure, and lacking objectivity in seeing the situation."
10524,176,1,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  It's because if you take a break without finishing your housework, it's difficult to rest properly because you feel anxious and uncomfortable."
10525,176,1,40,INFJ,25,<no>  It is because it is very tiring for me to see people with different opinions arguing over their opinions verbally or in writing.
10526,176,1,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  It's because when other people's eyes are focused on you, you feel pressured, your heart rate quickens, and you panic."
10527,176,1,40,INFJ,27,"<no> Even if you get angry with the people around you for trivial reasons, you feel better quickly with a quick apology or warm consolation from the other person."
10528,176,1,40,INFJ,28,<Yes>  There are times when you feel frustrated and annoyed when you repeat inefficient actions despite the fact that your co-workers have taught you how to do your work.
10529,176,1,40,INFJ,29,"<no>  If you put off things you have to do, you become anxious and feel pressured, so I tend to do it at the right time."
10530,176,1,40,INFJ,30,"<no> The question of the afterlife is uninteresting because the more you think about it, the more frightening and disturbing it is."
10531,176,1,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  Sometimes talking to other people is interesting, but alone time is more relaxing and enjoyable."
10532,176,1,40,INFJ,32,"<Yes>  Watching or directly sharing theory-oriented discussions or conversations often results in boredom, dizziness, and pain, so you quickly change the channel or leave the place."
10533,176,1,40,INFJ,33,"<no>  I think I sympathize with and understand the way of thinking and consumption of my friend who is much richer than me, but I don't think I can easily sympathize with or understand it with my heart."
10534,176,1,40,INFJ,34,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the situation or importance of the work. It seems that the higher the importance, the more you think and judge until the end before making a decision."
10535,176,1,40,INFJ,35,"<Yes>  There may be some regrets, but I tend not to think about it for the sake of mental health rather than stress over irreversible decisions."
10536,176,1,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  Parties and events can make your fatigue even worse, so for me the best way to unwind is to spend some time alone."
10537,176,1,40,INFJ,37,"<Yes>  don't understand all the works, but I want to see the world with different eyes through the artist's different senses."
10538,176,1,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  There are times when we are embarrassed when a friend suddenly gets angry or sheds tears during a conversation with friends. In any situation, there may be differences in each person's position, so I try to put myself in the other person's position without struggling."
10539,176,1,40,INFJ,39,"<neutrality>  I like to plan my business, but I don't plan personal things every day. Like travel, I tend to improvise according to the situation."
10540,176,1,40,INFJ,40,"<no>  In the past, there was no anxiety about the future, but as I get older, I seem to have a lot of anxiety about old age these days."
10541,176,1,40,INFJ,41,"<no>  These days, talking to friends and family over the phone is a common way to relieve stress."
10542,176,1,40,INFJ,42,"<Yes>  When there is a difference of opinion with others, rather than claiming that each other is right, I think a lot of dialogue and understanding are needed to narrow the big difference of opinion. Not too long ago, there was a lot of disagreement between siblings about their parents, and I had an experience that we resolved through talking over a period of several months."
10543,176,1,40,INFJ,43,"<neutrality> Friends contact me first, and sometimes they call me to see me because they want to see me, so it seems that we are contacting each other similarly."
10544,176,1,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes>  If it is judged that there is a setback in the plan, I tend to make an effort to return right away. On the way to the destination, there are cases where you think the road is strange, stop the car right away, search, realize that it is the wrong road, search again quickly, and go to the destination again."
10545,176,1,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes>  There are many times when I regret the mistakes I made to my parents in the past. These days, I keep thinking like that while watching my parents who are very old while living with my parents due to corona."
10546,176,1,40,INFJ,46,"<Yes>  I simply believe that happiness is the reason for human existence and life, so I don't like digging deeper into specifics."
10547,176,1,40,INFJ,47,"<Yes>  I think I am good at controlling my emotions to some extent, but people around me often tell me not to do that emotionally."
10548,176,1,40,INFJ,48,"<no>  When the other person's fault is obvious, I tend to speak clearly. Instead, I try to be as non-offensive as possible. Just as my self-esteem is important, I think the other person's self-esteem is also important."
10561,177,1,30,ESTJ,1,"<no>  Rather than making new friends periodically, I prefer to become friends through the experience of meeting people naturally. The reason is because I think a few friends who can open up are more precious than many friends who have a casual relationship."
10562,177,1,30,ESTJ,2,"<no>  Rather than exploring a variety of interests, I spend time on areas I already have an interest in. The reason is that I already have a solid field of interest and I think it is not enough to devote time to that field. These days, I'm interested in data labeling on the work side and on the behavior of dogs on the personal side."
10563,177,1,30,ESTJ,3,"<neutrality>  If I can sympathize with the reason why that person is crying, it seems to make me want to cry. If it is a sad situation that is objectively understandable, it is generally sympathetic and tears come out."
10564,177,1,30,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  try not to create situations that are difficult to predict, so I usually prepare several countermeasures. It's because it's very uncomfortable to be in a situation where you are faced with an unpredictable situation."
10565,177,1,30,ESTJ,5,"<Yes> Generally, I tend to keep my composure and try to solve the situation rationally. I am experiencing time and economic pressure due to the defendant's appeal after winning the case in a recent trial, but the appeal trial has not yet proceeded and is not something I can resolve at the moment, so I am trying to relieve the pressure through exercise and other activities."
10566,177,1,30,ESTJ,6,"<Yes> When I'm not the subject of a party or event, I tend to talk to people I'm already close to, rather than spending time introducing myself to new people. If I'm going to continue to meet for business or personal reasons, I'll try to introduce myself to new people, but if that's not the case, I don't think there's much need to spend time getting to know someone new."
10567,177,1,30,ESTJ,7,"<Yes>  usually finish high-priority projects before starting other projects. There were often cases in which several projects came in at once due to work. In this case, it is better to concentrate on the project with the highest priority as much as possible and then move on to the project with lower priority to improve the completeness of the work. I prefer to finish."
10568,177,1,30,ESTJ,8,"<no> Personally, I think I'm on the rational side, and I don't really like one emotion lasting for a long time. In particular, I try to brush off negative emotions quickly because I don't want them to affect my day or longer."
10569,177,1,30,ESTJ,9,"<Yes>  I am accustomed to making a daily routine, weekly plan, and monthly plan, and I love it. I like using apps like Paper Diary, Whiteboard Calendar, Reminders, and Calendar to organize my schedule and act on it."
10570,177,1,30,ESTJ,10,"<no>  I think that everyone can make mistakes and I try not to dwell on small mistakes. Memories of mistakes keep coming back to me, but I consciously try to forget them and promise myself that I won't make the same mistakes next time."
10571,177,1,30,ESTJ,11,"<Yes>  Generally, I tend to start a conversation with someone I'm interested in first, and once I find a common interest, I don't have much difficulty in conversing. Since I was young, when I had a natural peer group, I had a few conversations, and then I was the type to quickly become close with people of the same age who had the same interests."
10572,177,1,30,ESTJ,12,"<no>  If the range of art works includes books, I enjoy discussing different interpretations. I tend to like to talk about the thoughts of people from different backgrounds on a topic or conclusion. However, I don't really like to discuss who is right and who is wrong, I like to talk about what I would have done in this situation."
10573,177,1,30,ESTJ,13,"<Yes>  In a problem situation, I tend to think that finding a solution rationally is the priority rather than wasting time emotionally, and the evaluations of those around me are almost the same."
10574,177,1,30,ESTJ,14,"<no>  I have a set routine for the day and I like to stick with it. However, I think it is fun to improvise and do new things during the time when there is no fixed schedule during the routine."
10575,177,1,30,ESTJ,15,"<Yes>  I don't really care what other people think of me unless I'm causing harm to them. When I was living abroad, I thought I represented Koreans, so I was careful about my behavior, but as long as I wasn't hurting others, I thought I was already doing well enough, so I'm not so swayed by other people's opinions."
10576,177,1,30,ESTJ,16,"<neutrality>  I tend to actively participate in group activities when the group is already made up of people I am familiar with and like. However, I do not participate in group activities that I do not like. Now that I'm working as a freelancer, I rarely do group activities with people I'm not familiar with, but in the past, I didn't really enjoy taking part in company annual events during my breaks."
10577,177,1,30,ESTJ,17,"<no>  I like books and movies with clear endings. Among the books I read recently, <<Intimate Stranger"
10578,177,1,30,ESTJ,18,"<no>  In general, I seem to feel more satisfaction when I achieve results than when others succeed. The reason is that if you help someone else succeed in the same field, you will feel regret or deprivation yourself."
10579,177,1,30,ESTJ,19,"<no>  I have never thought about what to do because I have a fixed field of interest and I can set a date or set aside time to do it when I want to. I tend to set aside time for areas of interest that I can do alone after a day's work, and I tend to set a date in advance for areas that require several people to do together."
10580,177,1,30,ESTJ,20,"<Yes>  I tend to worry that things will go in an unexpected direction and get out of control. I don't worry too much if it's something I can solve within the time and economic situation I have, but I hate it extremely when something doesn't happen and I have to ask for help from others."
10581,177,1,30,ESTJ,21,"<no>  If they do not have the time or money to do so, they do not take on the leadership role, but they generally do. The reason is that achieving the goals of the organization is very important and I have the ability to lead or support in the process."
10582,177,1,30,ESTJ,22,"<Yes>  Since I was young, I haven't had good grades in arts and sports, and I don't think my creativity is very good. I think artistic inclination is to get inspiration from something and know how to express it artistically, but I prefer to analyze it rationally and draw clear conclusions."
10583,177,1,30,ESTJ,23,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different depending on which way you are talking about a better world. If rational is rational, I think it would have been a better world, at least economically."
10584,177,1,30,ESTJ,24,"<Yes> If there are unfinished chores, I have to do them after the break anyway, so I prefer to finish the chores first and then relax. Housework is included in my daily routine, and if I don't do it properly, it will affect the next day, so I try to do it without being pushed."
10585,177,1,30,ESTJ,25,"<no>  like to be part of an argument, but I don't like to watch other people's arguments. First of all, if the subject of the argument is related to me, I am curious about the conclusion of the argument and see if there is anything that can change my mind in the process."
10586,177,1,30,ESTJ,26,"<neutrality> He has no qualms about attracting attention in presentations or group actions that need to focus attention on a positive side, but he doesn't seem to do anything to attract other people's attention unless it's for work reasons. I don't seem to have much to draw attention to because I prefer doing familiar things rather than trying something new."
10587,177,1,30,ESTJ,27,"<neutrality> Feelings of trust, love, and friendship tend to last for a very long time, so even in friendships and relationships with the opposite sex, the duration is usually long."
10588,177,1,30,ESTJ,28,"<Yes> If you are performing individual tasks that do not affect others, individual efficiency is not very important. However, while performing tasks that require a group to produce results, you are very averse to harming others due to inefficiency. Even though I can get quick results by using my work time efficiently, I hate not using my time efficiently because I have experienced situations where I have to postpone work until the end of business hours or have to work overtime while doing personal work."
10589,177,1,30,ESTJ,29,"<no>  I tend to do things in advance. Recently, I've been looking to go swimming, and I've bought all the necessary items in advance."
10590,177,1,30,ESTJ,30,<no>  I don't believe in an afterlife. I'm not interested because I can't prove it scientifically and I haven't seen it myself.
10591,177,1,30,ESTJ,31,"<neutrality>  About a 7:3 ratio I like to be alone, but I also like to spend time with other people I am familiar with and like. Recently, I am spending time with other people in a way that does not interfere with my personal schedule and I am very satisfied."
10592,177,1,30,ESTJ,32,"<Yes>  I like discussing topics that can be applied to reality rather than theory-oriented discussions or principled stories. I have recently talked about the topic of marriage, but rather than the topic of why I get married and how I can define marriage, I want to discuss realistic issues such as how to maintain a good marriage and how to divide household chores fairly. I like."
10593,177,1,30,ESTJ,33,"<no>  can try to empathize, but I don't think I can say that I fully sympathize. I grew up with parents who were relatively liberal and respected my opinions. That's why I wasn't influenced much by other people in my future decisions, such as what kind of job I want to live in and what kind of country I want to live in. I felt helpless."
10594,177,1,30,ESTJ,34,<no>  I think you have to make a decision so you can move on to the next thing and prepare for it. That's why I tend to listen to other people's opinions and think a lot before making decisions quickly.
10595,177,1,30,ESTJ,35,"<Yes>  I think a lot, but I don't overturn or make decisions. I'd be lying if I said I never thought about opportunity cost. However, rather than overturning a decision I have already made, I tend to be prepared in case things go wrong."
10596,177,1,30,ESTJ,36,"<no>  tend to relieve the fatigue accumulated from events with my own time. I haven't had any stressful events or parties lately, but after meeting a lot of people, I always try to take some time to recharge myself."
10597,177,1,30,ESTJ,37,"<Yes>  Among art works, I tend to like them if I like the planning intention and the meaning of the work is relatively clear. However, I don't really like things that are esoteric and difficult to relate to, such as contemporary art."
10598,177,1,30,ESTJ,38,"<no>  Sometimes, but not often, emotions or behaviors are incomprehensible. It's hard to understand how you feel when you see someone who can't cut off a relationship that doesn't help you, and it's hard to see an unresolved situation from the side, so you tend to stay away until the situation is sorted out."
10599,177,1,30,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  like the feeling of accomplishment when I plan and accomplish my daily tasks. It's a small thing, but I really like the feeling of satisfaction when I plan a task and don't forget to complete it."
10600,177,1,30,ESTJ,40,"<no>  There are many times when I feel a bit insecure. Since I was young, I hated being put in a situation I couldn't solve on my own, and I think I was uncomfortable being put in a situation where I had to get help from someone."
10601,177,1,30,ESTJ,41,<no>  prefer phone calls because text messages or emails are frustrating to have to wait for an answer from the other person indefinitely.
10602,177,1,30,ESTJ,42,"<no>  If we have very different opinions and cannot come to an agreement, we don't bother trying to understand. There have been times when my religion or opinion has been unilaterally forced, but in this case, I don't bother to have more conversations because I think it's a waste of time to understand."
10603,177,1,30,ESTJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to say hello to close friends first and then contact them to meet up. When I call to meet, I tend to actively set up a meeting place and schedule."
10604,177,1,30,ESTJ,44,"<Yes>  think that the plan I have already made is the best solution after a lot of thought, so if there is a setback, I try to resolve it as quickly as possible and return to the original plan. Recently, while preparing for the wedding, I didn't plan to shoot the wedding, but after realizing that a few photos should be included in the mobile wedding invitation, I looked into it as soon as possible and made a reservation for a date that did not affect the wedding date so that the plan was not disrupted."
10605,177,1,30,ESTJ,45,"<Yes>  It seems that there are often times when we dwell on mistakes or decisions long ago. These days, I regret that I should have lived a little healthier because my health was not good due to bad habits in the past."
10606,177,1,30,ESTJ,46,"<Yes>  It is because we believe that there is no positive result that can be obtained by thinking deeply about human existence and the reason for living. Rather than thinking about existence and the reason for living, I tend to think more about how to realistically plan my life."
10607,177,1,30,ESTJ,47,"<no>  There are times when I am swayed by my emotions, but I try to control my emotions on my own and I am able to control them. If you continue to have negative emotions, you don't want to affect others, so when you can't control your negative emotions, you tend not to meet people well, and because of this, you often don't know that you have negative emotions around you."
10608,177,1,30,ESTJ,48,"<no>  When the other person's fault is obvious and the other person admits it, I try to comfort them, but I don't think it's right to save face when I've made a mistake, so I don't make this effort."
10621,178,0,30,ENFP,1,"<Yes> When I meet a new person, I feel a surge of new energy, and I tend to think that there is something called timeliness when it comes to friends, but while there are friends I can meet for a long time, I think that there are also people I can get along with most appropriately for the situation. I tend to meet new people regularly."
10622,178,0,30,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  I am a curious person, and I often want to find out about various things. These days, while preparing for a job, I became interested in the trade business, so I am studying related things."
10623,178,0,30,ENFP,3,"<Yes>  When you see someone crying, you often ask why that person is crying, and you usually sympathize with the reason and want to cry."
10624,178,0,30,ENFP,4,"<neutrality>  Originally, I was the type to push ahead with only one thing, but then I had a lot of failures, so after I got older, I made a second plan and a third plan and tried to respond."
10625,178,0,30,ENFP,5,"<neutrality>  There are definitely times when I feel anxious or impatient, but on the other hand, I tend to be optimistic, so I think it will just pass slowly and turn off my mind."
10626,178,0,30,ENFP,6,"<no>  I have a lot of fun talking to people I don't know, so I talk to people I know, but I try to talk to people I don't know as much as possible."
10627,178,0,30,ENFP,7,"<no>  With a personality that can be said to be distracting in a way, I tend to open up a lot of different tasks and solve them in parallel."
10628,178,0,30,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  Even in trivial things such as daily scenery or weather conditions, I tend to find and feel the emotions that fit the scenery much more sensitively than other people."
10629,178,0,30,ENFP,9,"<Yes>  I also enjoy making plans, so I don't use the diary because there are many cases where I get confused or I can't write consistently."
10630,178,0,30,ENFP,10,"<no>  don't think anyone is perfect, and I think there's plenty of room for mistakes 2 times out of 10. It's because I'm not a person. That's why I don't doubt my abilities just because I messed up once or twice. If the probability of doing well for a given task in the field is more than 80%, I think you are a competent person."
10631,178,0,30,ENFP,11,"<Yes>  Most of the time, people feel comfortable with me, so I relax my guard and respond well to conversations. And it's easy to make friends. Even the pickiest of dispositions are free to converse with me."
10632,178,0,30,ENFP,12,"<no>  I am very interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. Through such a conversation, I can know what kind of person the other person is, and I can learn about things I didn't know or hadn't seen before, so I really like having that kind of conversation."
10633,178,0,30,ENFP,13,"<neutrality> Emotions are also important, but I don't want to let emotions precede things, so I think I give enough consideration to rationality. People around me say that they are pushing ahead with the work they have been stuck on like a runaway locomotive."
10634,178,0,30,ENFP,14,"<Yes>  In fact, I like planning, but I don't like to be tied down to a plan, so I tend to write a whole to-do list for the day or week and do it in parallel. Then you can spend your time freely in it."
10635,178,0,30,ENFP,15,"<neutrality>  I always care about how other people see me, but I don't force myself to correct my behavior or focus all my attention on that person. Because each person thinks differently. But I think you should know exactly what the other person thinks of you."
10636,178,0,30,ENFP,16,"<neutrality>  like the group activity itself, but I don't prefer to adjust the things I want to do according to the group, so I tend to participate selectively."
10637,178,0,30,ENFP,17,"<Yes>  Works that leave a lasting impression always allow me to share many stories with people. So, I tend to enjoy movies like that. There are no recent works that I particularly remember."
10638,178,0,30,ENFP,18,"<no> It's true that helping others succeed is a great source of satisfaction, but that doesn't make it any more satisfying than your own success. Everyone's self is the most important."
10639,178,0,30,ENFP,19,"<Yes>  There are always so many things you want to do that there are times when you are confused about what to do next. For example, there are many things I want to do even when I am hanging out, so I often worry about which one to choose."
10640,178,0,30,ENFP,20,"<neutrality>  have an optimistic personality, but at the same time I am worried. The reason is that I had quite a few bad experiences, and my innate tendency itself is optimistic."
10641,178,0,30,ENFP,21,"<neutrality>  It depends on what kind of organization it is. Sometimes I'm aggressive, and other times I avoid it as much as possible."
10642,178,0,30,ENFP,22,"<no>  I have a personality that likes music and literature, and I think I have a lot of artistic inclinations. I have been to the Louvre three times."
10643,178,0,30,ENFP,23,"<no>  I think it would be really terrible if it was a world that excluded emotions and only valued reason. It would be a world of robots, not humans."
10644,178,0,30,ENFP,24,<no>  I don't prioritize between housework and rest because I think I can't work without energy.
10645,178,0,30,ENFP,25,"<neutrality>  I don't think it's necessarily fun, but I tend to watch a lot of discussion scenes."
10646,178,0,30,ENFP,26,"<no>  Regardless of how others see me, I always have the heart to act confidently. Whenever they are seen, they do not bother to avoid attention because they think they are doing something shameless."
10647,178,0,30,ENFP,27,"<neutrality>  It seems like that sometimes happens, but it's just a phenomenon that appears because I have rich emotions, and it's not capricious or anything."
10648,178,0,30,ENFP,28,<no>  I don't get annoyed because I don't really believe in the value of efficiency and I don't think it's something to be pursued.
10649,178,0,30,ENFP,29,"<Yes>  I always work close to deadlines. Last week, I barely met the deadline for the application form."
10650,178,0,30,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  We don't know where we go when we die, so I think it's only natural to wonder about it."
10651,178,0,30,ENFP,31,"<Yes>  I need some alone time sometimes, but most of the time I like to be with other people. The same is true these days."
10652,178,0,30,ENFP,32,"<no>  There must be a theory in order for the discussion to proceed. If you have a discussion without any logic, it's just an emotional discharge."
10653,178,0,30,ENFP,33,"<Yes> Background is an important factor in understanding people, but I tend to relate easily when someone who grew up in an unfamiliar environment explains it well. I tend to sympathize with and listen to the feelings of my foreign friends around me."
10654,178,0,30,ENFP,34,"<Yes>  Even after making a decision, I am not comfortable with it, so I change it again or hesitate until the deadline."
10655,178,0,30,ENFP,35,"<no>  Even if a decision has already been made, I tend to reconsider it as long as there is room for reversal. It's not easy to let it go from my heart until it leaves my hand."
10656,178,0,30,ENFP,36,<Yes>  It's good to go to a place with a lot of people and make noise and play noisily because it relieves stress.
10657,178,0,30,ENFP,37,<Yes>  I love visiting art galleries. I enjoy going to art galleries and spending time looking at the artwork.
10658,178,0,30,ENFP,38,"<no>  I empathize well in most situations, listen well to the other person's situation, and understand the feelings I feel as a result."
10659,178,0,30,ENFP,39,<Yes>  I like the act of planning. It's fun to make plans for work as well as personal things.
10660,178,0,30,ENFP,40,"<no>  Anxiety is pretty high. Although they are naturally optimistic, they also have innate anxiety."
10661,178,0,30,ENFP,41,"<no>  love talking on the phone and often spend hours talking with friends. It's more comfortable to communicate via messenger, but it's much more connected when you hear the real voice."
10662,178,0,30,ENFP,42,"<Yes> Even if it's different from me, I try to understand as much as possible. So it seems that especially when I was young, I spent a lot of time understanding people. These days, my understanding of various opinions has increased, and I have become well aware of what opinions I can accept, so that kind of time has decreased a lot."
10663,178,0,30,ENFP,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact them first and meet them. That way, it's easier to schedule, and there's a high chance that you'll see it at the place you want, when you want."
10664,178,0,30,ENFP,44,"<no> If things don't go according to plan, I tend to throw away the old plan and come up with a new one, or break away from the plan altogether and improvise."
10665,178,0,30,ENFP,45,"<no>  I tend to think a lot about my mistakes and often wonder what it would be like if I had acted differently, but that doesn't mean I regret it."
10666,178,0,30,ENFP,46,"<no>  On the contrary, I think it's too deep, and some people seem to think it's a problem. I think it's something we should think about as we go through life."
10667,178,0,30,ENFP,47,"<neutrality>  It's different depending on the time, but sometimes I think you need to go out as your emotions lead you. People around you value your feelings more."
10668,178,0,30,ENFP,48,"<neutrality>  I think it's a part that can act differently depending on the time. If the other person is attacking you, you don't have to save his face, but if it's not intentional, I think there's plenty of room to cover it."
10681,179,1,40,INTP,1,"<Yes>  I didn't mean to, but I'm the type of person who naturally gets close with people I met while going to a new job. You cannot do work alone, so there are many things that are difficult to do unless you become close friends."
10682,179,1,40,INTP,2,"<Yes> When I have time, I spend time watching Instagram, cafe posts, webtoons or dramas. In particular, if you look at the cafe posts, you can get various information, and you often laugh because the gag code is correct. These days, when you start labeling your data, you spend a lot of time getting information about it."
10683,179,1,40,INTP,3,"<no>  It's different depending on the situation, but I don't want to cry unless it's a situation that I really sympathize with. When I want to cry, I don't have much empathy for that person, but there are times when I cry because I feel sorry for the situation that person is in."
10684,179,1,40,INTP,4,<no>  I don't usually assume that things won't go well. So there are almost no preparations.
10685,179,1,40,INTP,5,"<no>  When the pressure is high, there is a lot of stress inside. Others say that I keep a good poker face, but I am stressed on the inside, and when such a situation hits, it shows up as gastritis, gastric ulcer, or phlegm."
10686,179,1,40,INTP,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I already know. It's comfortable and I don't know what topics to talk about with people I don't know. I tend to have a good conversation when the other person talks to me first, but I rarely talk to someone I don't know first."
10687,179,1,40,INTP,7,"<no> While I'm working on this labeling right now, I'm going around the site here and there, and when a task that suits me comes up, I start it first, and when I get a little bored, I'm involved in other tasks."
10688,179,1,40,INTP,8,<no>  I think it's rational rather than sentimental. The state of sentimentalism doesn't last long and I don't feel it very well.
10689,179,1,40,INTP,9,"<no>  I'm not the type to organize things well, so if there's something important, I just jot it down on my phone schedule, and I tend to rely on my memory for other things."
10690,179,1,40,INTP,10,"<no>  I blame myself for small mistakes, but it doesn't mean I doubt my ability, and I believe that I will get better soon because I believe in myself who will improve further. I think it's just something that happens because I'm still immature, and I'm confident that I can make up for it, so I don't doubt myself."
10691,179,1,40,INTP,11,"<Yes>  If you are interested, you can kindly approach and talk first. If you are interested in a person, it means that you had a period of time to figure out about that person, even for a short time. If you like someone, you can greet them first and talk to them. Since most people are interested in people with good personality, the other person accepts them well and there was no problem in talking to each other."
10692,179,1,40,INTP,12,"<neutrality>  If it's a work I know well, I enjoy expressing my opinion. And it's fun to hear other people's opinions. But if it's something I'm not familiar with or a work I'm not interested in, I don't want to discuss it because I'm not interested in it."
10693,179,1,40,INTP,13,"<Yes> I'm on the positive side. First of all, I tend to feel a bit disgusted when I see people who act based on emotions, and I sometimes hear people around me say that they are cold-hearted. However, most of them tend to empathize with their emotions in order to evaluate others even if their heads think so."
10694,179,1,40,INTP,14,"<Yes>  Unless it's an important schedule, I tend to do what I feel like doing every day, and even if I make a plan, there are times when I don't keep it. My efficiency tends to rise when I do what I want to do, but there are things I have to do, but I don¡¯t do it or don¡¯t do it."
10695,179,1,40,INTP,15,"<Yes> Anyway, people's evaluation is subjective, and no matter how good I am, it's not easy to change the mind of someone who hates me, and I don't think there's any need to pay attention to people who hate me. Of course, it hurts when someone I like criticizes me, but I don't have to worry because I think what to do if someone I hate points out me."
10696,179,1,40,INTP,16,"<no>  don't like doing group activities because I have to hang out with people I'm not close to and I have to step forward. It is comfortable and enjoyable to be close to a small number of people, not a large number of people."
10697,179,1,40,INTP,17,"<Yes>  like closed endings, but I also like open endings. I tend to find out what I thought and what other people interpreted like this through search. It's interesting that there are different interpretations. I haven't seen a work with an open ending recently, but what I remember is the wailing. It was a movie that made me think a lot because I was curious about the life and death of the family at the end of the wailing and the future actions of the demon and the shaman."
10698,179,1,40,INTP,18,"<no> People think they are more important than others. First of all, I think the most important thing is to succeed myself, and only after I succeed can I congratulate others. I think it's much more valuable to shine than others."
10699,179,1,40,INTP,19,"<Yes>  I like to look at this and that, and I also like to communicate online. That's why there are so many dramas and webtoons that I'm interested in, and I have to talk in group KakaoTalk rooms and play games that I enjoy."
10700,179,1,40,INTP,20,"<no>  I tend to worry a little, but I think my belief that things will work out is bigger. I think it's because I don't like to think for a long time, and I'm also on the positive side."
10701,179,1,40,INTP,21,"<Yes> It's because I don't like talking in front and it's burdensome to have to lead and take care of so many people. Listening to the complaints and demands of so many people makes my head hurt and painful just thinking about it, so I want to avoid it as much as possible."
10702,179,1,40,INTP,22,"<Yes>  There is no decorating or manual skill. I hated art class since I was little, and I have had quite a hard experience because I couldn't figure out how to work."
10703,179,1,40,INTP,23,"<Yes>  think that if we focus only on emotions, society will not be maintained properly. I think it is more necessary for a better future to rationally revise and protect laws and systems."
10704,179,1,40,INTP,24,"<no>  First of all, I tend to finish my housework after resting. When I need a break, I feel really depleted of energy, so I feel very tired, so I first rest and recover my energy before doing housework."
10705,179,1,40,INTP,25,"<Yes> Because it's interesting to hear what other people think. Of course, I feel repulsed by thoughts that are so opposite to mine, but I'm interested in them because I'm curious about why they think that way."
10706,179,1,40,INTP,26,"<Yes>  I don't want to create a situation that makes other people uncomfortable, and I don't want to get attention by acting out because I'm uncomfortable with people I'm not interested in."
10707,179,1,40,INTP,27,"<no>  don't usually have big emotional fluctuations, and even if I feel annoyance, annoyance, or joy, they tend to pass very briefly and I tend to maintain a calm state."
10708,179,1,40,INTP,28,"<Yes>  When I work together, I get angry when I see that person work frustratingly, and when I do the same thing slowly, I feel like I'm losing money, so I get annoyed."
10709,179,1,40,INTP,29,"<Yes> I'm usually lazy, so I often put off work, but recently I put off washing the dishes and washed the dishes because there were no more dishes to use. I often put off unimportant things."
10710,179,1,40,INTP,30,"<Yes>  The afterlife is a part that I do not know and do not know, so I am curious about it, so when such a topic comes up, I get interested. It's something I won't know until I die."
10711,179,1,40,INTP,31,"<neutrality> Most of the time I enjoy being alone, but sometimes I like to share the little things of my life with others and have a little laugh, so if it's not a lot of time, I also enjoy spending time with others."
10712,179,1,40,INTP,32,"<Chinese>  Theory is important. However, I am interested only in those theory-based discussions that interest me, not in all of them."
10713,179,1,40,INTP,33,"<no>  I'm interested in the story of someone from a background I haven't experienced, but I don't sympathize because I haven't experienced it myself. When I meet people with a big age gap and hear about them when I was young, I am often amazed and wonder why they did that, so I don't sympathize with them."
10714,179,1,40,INTP,34,"<Yes>  Before I do something, I tend to worry about whether it will be like this or that. I can't make a judgment easily and I'm thinking about it, but I'm going to have a little trouble, and I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of Until the time I have to make a decision."
10715,179,1,40,INTP,35,"<Yes>  First of all, since I spent a lot of time making a decision, I tend to work in the direction I decided without thinking about it further."
10716,179,1,40,INTP,36,"<no>  When fatigue builds up, I tend to spend time sleeping alone or watching my favorite dramas or webtoons. First of all, fatigue builds up from going out, so when you're tired, you don't feel the pleasure of hanging out with people."
10717,179,1,40,INTP,37,"<no>  When I go to an art gallery for a reason, I like to see it, but I don't necessarily go looking for it."
10718,179,1,40,INTP,38,<Yes>  It's hard to understand people who show a lot of emotion. I feel a little disgust when I see someone who yells at the other person or fights with them in an overemotional state.
10719,179,1,40,INTP,39,"<no>  I tend to organize what I have to do tomorrow in my head, but I don't make specific or precise plans."
10720,179,1,40,INTP,40,"<Yes>  I think a lot, but it doesn't last long, and I feel anxious, but I don't think it's going to last because I don't think deeply. I think about many things, but I don't feel very anxious because I don't keep thinking about one thing."
10721,179,1,40,INTP,41,"<neutrality> When I was young, I wanted to avoid phone calls with people I don't know, but as I get older, that doesn't happen often, but I want to avoid phone calls with people in trouble, and I try not to talk on the phone as much as possible."
10722,179,1,40,INTP,42,"<no>  I don't listen to people who disagree with me. I tend to refute my arguments and tell the other person my logic. I will listen to opinions that I can tolerate to some extent, but I tend to ignore them when they are spoken with logic that I do not understand."
10723,179,1,40,INTP,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to make an appointment first, but I tend to leave when I get a call. The process of preparing is annoying and tiring, so it's not often that we ask to meet first."
10724,179,1,40,INTP,44,"<no>  It depends on the type of plan, but if it's not a big deal, I tend to take a break and plan again if there's a setback."
10725,179,1,40,INTP,45,"<Yes> The regret I always have is that I often think of the fact that I did not write well in my university application, and it is the thing I regret the most. If I did it right then, I have a lot of regrets that it would have changed a lot now."
10726,179,1,40,INTP,46,<Yes>  Human beings often think about why they have to live like this. I often think about why I have to go through various social processes from birth to death and live hard to achieve it.
10727,179,1,40,INTP,47,"<no> People around me have often heard that I am good at maintaining a poker face, and my emotions do not vary greatly, so I tend to control myself well."
10728,179,1,40,INTP,48,"<no>  I don't criticize because it's wrong, but I don't think it's necessary to save that person's face. It is because they believe that they must recognize their mistakes and reflect on themselves so that they will not do such mistakes again."
10741,180,1,40,INFJ,1,<no>  don't feel the need to make new friends because I'm more comfortable with people I already know than new friends.
10742,180,1,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  I always have a desire to know something because I enjoy coming into contact with new knowledge. For example, even if you eat a bag of cookies, you like to read all the words written on the bag, including ingredients and precautions. My interests these days are industry trends related to data labeling and AI development, which I am currently doing."
10743,180,1,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes>  He empathizes very well, so if someone cries next to him, he cries along. I feel like I can feel that person¡¯s heart, and my personal sadness multiplies and I cry together."
10744,180,1,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes> It's not very many alternatives, but I always live with at least 'Plan B' in mind. When I do something, I do it in a planned way, but when I deviate from the plan, I get very anxious, so if I prepare an alternative, I feel less anxious even if it goes wrong."
10745,180,1,40,INFJ,5,"<neutrality>  tend to be swayed by my emotions, so it's actually difficult to maintain my composure when the pressure is severe. However, there is a difference in degree depending on the type of pressure. For example, in a situation where people are in the spotlight, I am too nervous to speak, but when an irrational conflict occurs, I tend to be quiet."
10746,180,1,40,INFJ,6,"<neutrality> First of all, I don't like to attend parties or events, but if I do, I can talk to new people without problems unless I really don't want to talk to them. Rather than interacting only with people you know, you can do it if it is helpful to build friendships with many people as it is a place you have already been to."
10747,180,1,40,INFJ,7,"<neutrality>  It depends on the inclination of the project. Usually, I like to multitask for things that I don't care about like housework, and I tend to finish one project and then move on to another when it comes to complex tasks."
10748,180,1,40,INFJ,8,"<Yes>  Ever since I was young, when a Korean athlete won a gold medal in an Olympic game, I cried and cried for no reason, but other family members who watched it teased me if it was enough to make me cry. I think it's because I have a personality that empathizes well with other people's feelings."
10749,180,1,40,INFJ,9,"<Yes>  really like making plans. Set the alarm by setting it up by the minute. It's annoying to write down, so I record everything I need on my phone calendar and set an alarm. It was nice to see that the month's schedule was tightly packed at the end of the month."
10750,180,1,40,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  pride myself on having a very good memory, but these days, sometimes my memory is wrong. During a conversation with my child, I felt embarrassed when I judged that I was wrong through the mediation of my husband because my past memories were different. Then I feel depressed, but at the same time, I have a strong will to study more."
10751,180,1,40,INFJ,11,"<neutrality>  There are many times when I treat people I have a real crush on, and I feel more comfortable dealing with someone I have a good crush on."
10752,180,1,40,INFJ,12,"<no>  When I encounter art works such as music or novels, I enjoy talking about the thoughts that suddenly come to me. The reason is because I feel good when I go through such work because I feel that the work of art is entirely mine."
10753,180,1,40,INFJ,13,"<neutrality> It depends. When problems arise with children or families, they judge relatively rationally, but in other situations, they follow their emotions. So, my family also wants to discuss things with me."
10754,180,1,40,INFJ,14,"<no>  I don't like plans to go wrong, so I tend to plan the schedule in my head the night before going to bed."
10755,180,1,40,INFJ,15,"<no>  tend to be quite conscious of the gazes around me. As I avoid situations in which others are inconvenienced by my existence or actions, I am always concerned that I may appear selfish in the eyes of others."
10756,180,1,40,INFJ,16,<no>  I don't like group activities. I feel comfortable doing things by myself even at work or during my free time. I try to avoid meetings or group activities unless it is unavoidable.
10757,180,1,40,INFJ,17,"<no>  I tend to accept the ending as it is. In short, I tend to adapt, thinking that everything has meaning. That's why books and movies also respect the author's worldview. For this reason, I have no complaints about the recent drama Hwanhon, which ended in tragedy."
10758,180,1,40,INFJ,18,"<neutrality> As an altruistic individualist, I am a person who can happily accept the success of others. The reason is that I don't give up what I have, but I don't want to take away what others have."
10759,180,1,40,INFJ,19,"<Yes>  Sometimes, because I have so many interests, I can't figure out what to prioritize. Not too long ago, I was doing housework, and while I was cleaning, I went to the sink to wash the dishes while I was cleaning, and I suddenly realized that I was cleaning and laughed."
10760,180,1,40,INFJ,20,<Yes>  I keep worrying until I finish something. The reason for this is that there are many times when I have been embarrassed and hurt because I have not been able to cope with unexpected variables well.
10761,180,1,40,INFJ,21,<Yes>  I like the role of working quietly behind the scenes rather than being a leader or leader. The reason is that being a leader or leader puts a lot of pressure on them and they don't like being in the spotlight.
10762,180,1,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  I think my artistic inclination, especially my musical sense, is slightly more developed than others. Since I was young, I am accustomed to understanding objects and sounds with my sense of pitch, so I still have a habit of thinking musically. For example, I have a habit of humming a doorbell as a commandment, or guessing what the next melody will be like by predicting the harmony of a song I'm hearing for the first time."
10763,180,1,40,INFJ,23,"<no>  I think emotions and rationality should be balanced properly, but in reality, reason dominates. Even in political or socio-economic policy judgments, it is fair to exclude emotions and make rational and rational judgments, and it is often said that we should not go wrong with emotions."
10764,180,1,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  I can't sleep well if I can't finish my work. For example, if I'm tired after dinner, but I don't finish washing the dishes, I keep getting distracted and finish the reference work even though I'm tired. If I think it's something I have to do, it's because I feel comfortable only after I've done all the hard work."
10765,180,1,40,INFJ,25,"<Yes>  I think a fight of words and logic rather than a physical fight is a true confrontation. It's fun to watch people argue, to see how my supporters logically beat their opponents, to verify my logic, and to learn new ways of thinking that I hadn't thought of before."
10766,180,1,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  I try to avoid attracting people's attention. This is because when you receive attention from others and focus on them, you become psychologically intimidated and nervous, so you make many mistakes in the things you normally do well."
10767,180,1,40,INFJ,27,"<no>  am like a calm lake emotionally. Once a feeling is established, it persists. For example, when I feel depressed because I have a problem, the feeling of depression persists. At that time, I have many troubles because it does not work well even if I try to change my mood."
10768,180,1,40,INFJ,28,"<Yes>  Because I think I'm extremely ordinary, it's so frustrating to see people who are less effective than me. There was a boss who recklessly gave orders without giving priority to work, but I was so angry that I couldn't convince him, so I had an argument."
10769,180,1,40,INFJ,29,"<no>  When I have something to do, I usually do it first and then take a break for the rest of the time. Lately, I have a lot of things to do, so I have less free time, but I still enjoy my rest after handling the work as efficiently as possible in advance."
10770,180,1,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes>  It's not a subject I always think about, but I'm interested in whether or not there is an afterlife. In fact, I am a devout Christian, but Christianity explains that when a person dies, they are saved and enjoy the blessing of eternal life. ."
10771,180,1,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  I am very happy when I am alone. Getting married, giving birth, and raising children, I can hardly remember the last time I sat comfortably and was bruised because I was always hit by household chores and children. I want to take parental leave on a regular basis."
10772,180,1,40,INFJ,32,"<neutrality>  think theory-based discussions are necessary, but I feel ideal and boring when I see people who only talk about principles. I have participated in work-related discussions. Professors talk about utopias that are unlikely to be realized based on theories they know, while practitioners explain well how to find clues to solving problems through practical application examples based on theories. I felt that there was a visual difference."
10773,180,1,40,INFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I wonder if it is possible to fully empathize with someone whose background is completely different from mine. However, I try to understand and sympathize with the other person's position as much as possible. Closely, there was a time when my husband expressed his concerns to me, and I tried to empathize as much as possible even though my background and my husband were completely different."
10774,180,1,40,INFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to make my decisions after as much thought as possible, so I tend to make my decisions last, as long as I have time to think. That way, I think you can make a decision without regrets."
10775,180,1,40,INFJ,35,"<Yes>  It's natural for me to take responsibility for the decisions I make, and I love doing so. So, we take a very careful approach until we make a decision and try to fulfill the results as faithfully as possible."
10776,180,1,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  For me, the true cure for fatigue is spending time alone. Outside events or outings always made me feel more tired and empty when I came back home. Even these days, on weekends when I go to my in-laws' house, I make sure to make some time alone on weekdays to rest."
10777,180,1,40,INFJ,37,"<Yes> I'm not well versed in art, so I don't go to art museums often, but I like to appreciate art related to music. Since I was young, I used to follow my parents to classical performances several times a year."
10778,180,1,40,INFJ,38,"<neutrality> Based on my experience, I tend to try to understand other people's feelings as much as possible, and in many cases I can, but sometimes I can't fathom the feelings of people in situations I've never been through. For example, it is the case that we do not fully understand the feelings of parents who lost their children or those who suddenly lost their family due to an accident."
10779,180,1,40,INFJ,39,"<Yes>  like to live each day with a plan and feel a sense of accomplishment when things go according to plan. When making appointments with acquaintances as well as at work, plan and estimate the amount of time required for the preparation process before going out before deciding."
10780,180,1,40,INFJ,40,"<no> There are many times when I feel insecure, and although I have a natural tendency, I think I was influenced to some extent by my family environment. My parents are very concerned about safety, so they told me to be careful in everything, but now that I'm an adult, I always warn my children to be careful."
10781,180,1,40,INFJ,41,"<Yes>  When communicating, I like to express myself in writing rather than speaking, so I would like to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible. The reason is that there are many cases where I don't respond well when I'm talking, so I can't say everything I want to say."
10782,180,1,40,INFJ,42,"<neutrality>  I tend to pay attention to disagreements only when the situation is deeply related to me. For example, if I have a disagreement with my husband about how to raise my children, I try to understand the direction and reason of my husband's thoughts, but I don't put the words of a third person passing by and move on."
10783,180,1,40,INFJ,43,"<no>  I'm not good at contacting you to meet first. It's because I tend to adjust rather than lead human relationships, and I don't like contact itself very much. Having said that, I am so grateful to the friends who remain by my side and keep in touch with me."
10784,180,1,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes> When my plan goes wrong, I panic and try to fit it quickly. I had a job scheduled for some time the other day, but I had to go to the children's hospital at that time, so I couldn't make it on time. So, after I went to the child's hospital, I returned to work, albeit belatedly, to take care of the work."
10785,180,1,40,INFJ,45,"<no>  have a good memory, so I tend to remember most of my mistakes from a long time ago. Some mistakes still kick the covers, but I don't regret them that much. These days, as I get older, I sometimes stumble over my words, but when I first got sick with COVID-19, I once called corona ¡°cors¡± (a mix of corona and MERS) to a slightly difficult acquaintance I still meet often, so I regret it every time I meet him. I'm trying to say something properly."
10786,180,1,40,INFJ,46,<no>  love to think deeply about human existence and why we live. The reason is that I enjoy repeating my thoughts in the hope of understanding on my own about incomprehensible phenomena or human psychology.
10787,180,1,40,INFJ,47,"<Yes>  I tend to be swayed by emotions. I myself consider that part to be my weakness, and the people around me agree that I am emotional."
10788,180,1,40,INFJ,48,"<neutrality> If someone is not in a unfair situation due to the other person's fault, I tend to try to save face whenever possible. If it's a simple mistake, it's because I think covering up the wrong is to be considerate for the other person."
10801,181,1,40,INFJ,1,<no>  I don't try to make new friends. Because it's better to get to know each other naturally.
10802,181,1,40,INFJ,2,"<neutrality>  tend to spend my free time leisurely, so I don't bother looking for a variety of interests. These days, I have a lot of interest in coding because I often come into contact with the metaverse platform."
10803,181,1,40,INFJ,3,"<neutrality>  It depends on what circumstances the other person is crying. If you're crying in an understandable situation, you're sad together, but if not, you're calm."
10804,181,1,40,INFJ,4,"<neutrality>  It depends on the type of work, but if it's important to you, consider all the variables. It's because you're clumsy in how to deal with unexpected situations."
10805,181,1,40,INFJ,5,"<no>  I don't show signs on the outside, but on the inside I'm very stressed out. A recent experience was when I was not satisfied with the level of completion of work when I had to finish it on time."
10806,181,1,40,INFJ,6,<Yes>  It's because I feel comfortable having a conversation with someone I know in an unfamiliar place.
10807,181,1,40,INFJ,7,"<neutrality> When you're working on a single project, you complete one and start another, but when you're working with a group of people, you do it simultaneously."
10808,181,1,40,INFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I am generally sentimental, but when it comes to making rational decisions about things, I am not driven by emotion."
10809,181,1,40,INFJ,9,"<neutrality>  I love my diary, but I prefer checking, organizing, and documenting large schedules rather than making detailed plans."
10810,181,1,40,INFJ,10,"<neutrality>  Most of them skip it, but it depends on the situation and how you feel when you make a mistake. We doubt our ability or knowledge when we are among people who are too good at it, or when things do not go our way."
10811,181,1,40,INFJ,11,"<neutrality>  If you have the same interests or know each other, it's not difficult to start a conversation, but if not, don't talk first because you have nothing to say."
10812,181,1,40,INFJ,12,"<Yes> This is because I am interested in art, music, and movies, and I like broadening my horizons through people's diverse thoughts."
10813,181,1,40,INFJ,13,"<neutrality>  I'm emotional when I'm alone, but when I'm with others, I tend to be more rational and calm to reduce mistakes."
10814,181,1,40,INFJ,14,"<neutrality>  Depends on weekdays and holidays. On weekdays, I plan and move around work and study, and on holidays, I tend to be spontaneous."
10815,181,1,40,INFJ,15,"<no> I'm just curious about it occasionally, but I'm not worried about it. The reason is that you can't like everyone."
10816,181,1,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  When I work with many people, many things happen, so I don't like it. But these days, I'm a little tired because I have more group activities because of my interests."
10817,181,1,40,INFJ,17,"<neutrality>  don't feel anything about interpreting it in my own way because I like to hear opinions that are different from mine. If you like to interpret it in your own way, I respect it because it is also the person's idea."
10818,181,1,40,INFJ,18,"<no>  I find satisfaction in helping others, but I think it is necessary in moderation. The reason is because I don't know how much the other person will acknowledge my efforts."
10819,181,1,40,INFJ,19,"<no> There have been moments when my interests have suddenly increased, but I have been able to rank them in order of importance because I know that if I start working too much, I won't be able to do it all."
10820,181,1,40,INFJ,20,"<no>  I had a lot of worries in the past, but after realizing that I was giving myself a hard time, I tend to find specific ways to get rid of my worries."
10821,181,1,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes>  This is because it is inconvenient to appear in front of others, it is difficult to coordinate the disagreements of many people, and it is annoying because there are many unnecessary things."
10822,181,1,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  It's because I've been interested in it since I was young, I'm doing it as a hobby, and I see myself focusing and having fun."
10823,181,1,40,INFJ,23,"<no>  Of course, there are some things I wish I could judge more rationally. However, considering the various things happening in the world, I think both emotion and reason are important."
10824,181,1,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  Of course, there are some things I wish I could judge more rationally. However, considering the various things happening in the world, I think both emotion and reason are important."
10825,181,1,40,INFJ,25,"<Yes>  Mostly yes. The reason is that when you listen to other people's thoughts, you can find out what you didn't think of."
10826,181,1,40,INFJ,26,<neutrality>  I tend not to think about it. It's because I have a quiet personality and I have no time to think about anything else when I'm thinking about something.
10827,181,1,40,INFJ,27,"<no> If it means you have a lot of emotional ups and downs, then it's not. He usually tries to keep his mood calm and has a slightly nonchalant personality."
10828,181,1,40,INFJ,28,"<no>  Mostly not. It may be because the solution method is different or not known, and it is because you have to experience it to create your own way."
10829,181,1,40,INFJ,29,"<Yes>  Most are like that. I don't intentionally procrastinate, but the efficiency of work is very low, so I often waste time. Lately, I tend to finish on time."
10830,181,1,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes>  As a child, I enjoyed reading stories about myths, legends, and folktales, and because of my curiosity about the unknown world."
10831,181,1,40,INFJ,31,"<no>  I tend to get tired easily when I am with other people, so I prefer to spend time alone."
10832,181,1,40,INFJ,32,"<Yes>  It's mostly like that. Theories and principled stories are also necessary, but I think it's a waste of time to repeat stories that have limits and have nothing to learn."
10833,181,1,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  It's mostly like that. Even if the background is different, if you have had the same or similar experience, you can relate."
10834,181,1,40,INFJ,34,"<neutrality>  Except for things that require really careful decisions, I tend to make decisions at the right time."
10835,181,1,40,INFJ,35,<Yes>  Mostly yes. It's because I made a decision after considering the situation enough and I thought there would be no regrets.
10836,181,1,40,INFJ,36,<no> It feels like my energy is recharged when I am alone and quiet rather than in a noisy atmosphere like parties and events.
10837,181,1,40,INFJ,37,"<Yes>  When I look at a work of art, I like to see the texture, color, expression, and mood of the material."
10838,181,1,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  As time and experience are proportional, even if you haven't experienced it yourself, you can suffice to guess from similar experiences."
10839,181,1,40,INFJ,39,"<neutrality>  neither like nor dislike planning. I've experienced the advantage of being able to work efficiently if I make a plan, and knowing what I've done."
10840,181,1,40,INFJ,40,"<neutrality>  I don't feel anxious for no reason. If you think about it when you feel anxious, there was a reason and it goes away once the situation passes or is resolved. It seems like an innate tendency."
10841,181,1,40,INFJ,41,"<no>  I want to avoid uncomfortable situations, but I've never wanted to avoid it for no reason."
10842,181,1,40,INFJ,42,"<no>  I usually think from the other person's point of view, but when it's too different, I don't do it because I'm tired of spending time and paying attention."
10843,181,1,40,INFJ,43,"<neutrality>  When there is a common interest or something a friend might like, even if you contact them first, they will not contact you for trivial matters."
10844,181,1,40,INFJ,44,"<neutrality> Depends on how things are going. If we can fix it quickly, we try, but if not, we slow down or revise our plans for the better."
10845,181,1,40,INFJ,45,"<no>  There are times when I suddenly think of past mistakes, but I don't have many regrets."
10846,181,1,40,INFJ,46,"<no>  If you look at the thoughts of Eastern and Western philosophers, you can think about the direction of your life and look back on how you should live after being born as a human being, so you deeply think about existence and why."
10847,181,1,40,INFJ,47,"<neutrality>  When I get swayed by my emotions, I tend to try to stay centered. When I'm swayed by my emotions, I tend to solve it alone without showing signs on the outside, so I don't really know unless it's someone close to me."
10848,181,1,40,INFJ,48,"<neutrality>  It depends on the seriousness of what the other person did wrong. As a rule, they do not act to reduce the face of the other person or make an effort to save them."
10861,182,1,30,ENTP,1,<no>  I'm not the type to try to make new friends regularly. It's usually good to interact with comfortable friends that I already know.
10862,182,1,30,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  I spend most of my free time exploring my interests. These days, I'm interested in a job called a developer, so I'm looking into the front-end developer course."
10863,182,1,30,ENTP,3,<Yes>  I often want to cry when I see other people crying in dramas or movies. I think the reason is because I have a lot of empathy for other people's situations.
10864,182,1,30,ENTP,4,<Yes>  I tend to prepare for various situations in case things go wrong. The reason is because you think things can't always go the way you think.
10865,182,1,30,ENTP,5,"<no>  In an environment where there is a lot of pressure, I think I can't hide my anxiety and get flustered. Recently, I felt a lot of anxiety and my mind went blank while I was doing a lot of work."
10866,182,1,30,ENTP,6,"<Yes> When I meet someone new at an event, I tend to introduce myself first. Although I feel much more comfortable talking to people I already know, I find it more fun to meet new people at parties and events."
10867,182,1,30,ENTP,7,"<no>  I tend to do many things together. If I get stuck or get bored while working on one project, I think it's much more efficient to work on another project at the same time."
10868,182,1,30,ENTP,8,"<neutrality>  tend to be sentimental to some extent, but I think I tend to think rationally depending on the situation. I don't act sentimental, especially when it's work-related or completely unrelated to me."
10869,182,1,30,ENTP,9,"<Yes>  When I do everything, I tend to make a plan and start by making a schedule or list on my phone calendar or notepad. It makes me feel comfortable doing that."
10870,182,1,30,ENTP,10,"<no>  tend not to doubt myself when I make a small mistake. Even if I make a small mistake while working, I tend to correct it coolly, thinking that people can do it. If you really didn't know, I think you should just learn."
10871,182,1,30,ENTP,11,<Yes>  Most of the time I approach people I am interested in and start a conversation. It wasn't always difficult.
10872,182,1,30,ENTP,12,"<no>  like watching movies, books, and works of art and interpreting them in various ways. It's interesting to listen to other people's opinions and views and see the work again, because it often looks different."
10873,182,1,30,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. I think that when emotions get involved too much in what should be rational, things can go awry. It seems that people around me are usually evaluated as being realistic."
10874,182,1,30,ENTP,14,"<no>  tend to prefer planning and doing things for the day rather than improvising. Usually, you have to do everything you planned to finish the day."
10875,182,1,30,ENTP,15,<no>  I tend to be very shaken by the evaluations of people around me. It is because I have a lot of greed to be seen as a person who is good at everything and I myself evaluate others well.
10876,182,1,30,ENTP,16,"<no>  find it much more comfortable to work alone than to work in a group. I used to really like group activities, but I think I changed a lot as I got older. I have been able to avoid conflicts with people."
10877,182,1,30,ENTP,17,"<Yes>  I really like open endings. Recently, I enjoyed watching director Bong Joon-ho's movie Parasite, and my favorite movie is Life of Pi."
10878,182,1,30,ENTP,18,"<no>  consider my success to be the most important. I can feel some satisfaction in helping others succeed, but more often than not, I am jealous. It seems that the desire to be recognized is much greater."
10879,182,1,30,ENTP,19,"<no>  I have a lot of interests, but I don't think it's to the extent that I don't know what to do next. I tend to do what I have to do and spend time on my interests."
10880,182,1,30,ENTP,20,"<no> I'm not the type to worry about things going wrong. I think that everything is proportional to the time and effort I put in, so I tend to live thinking that things that go well will go well and things that don't go well will not."
10881,182,1,30,ENTP,21,"<no>  I often take on a leadership role in groups. I can be more responsible to lead than to delegate, and I usually feel a sense of accomplishment in doing so."
10882,182,1,30,ENTP,22,"<no>  think I have a lot of artistic inclinations. Since I was young, I have loved art and music very much, so I went on to study design."
10883,182,1,30,ENTP,23,<Yes>  I think the world would be a better place if people valued reason more. I think the worst can be avoided if we make rational judgments and act in all conflict situations.
10884,182,1,30,ENTP,24,"<no>  recommend taking a break first rather than doing housework. This is because they believe that once the body has recovered, it will have the energy to do other things."
10885,182,1,30,ENTP,25,<Yes>  I find it interesting to hear other people's different views on any matter. That's why I like discussion programs.
10886,182,1,30,ENTP,26,<no>  I tend to do things that attract other people's attention without hesitation. I think it is when I see the side that likes to step out.
10887,182,1,30,ENTP,27,"<Yes>  I have very high emotional ups and downs. For example, even if you are in a great mood, you may suddenly feel bad because of a certain situation, or you may feel better quickly even if you are depressed."
10888,182,1,30,ENTP,28,"<Yes>  When I see people who work more inefficiently than I know how to do, I often get annoyed and want to teach them."
10889,182,1,30,ENTP,29,<Yes>  We often procrastinate on things to do. You tend to get things done faster and more efficiently when your deadline is imminent. Even recently.
10890,182,1,30,ENTP,30,<no>  I am not interested in the afterlife. I think everything is over after death.
10891,182,1,30,ENTP,31,"<Yes> It's better to be with other people than to be alone. These days, there are times when I often think that I want to be alone, but it seems to be more powerful when someone is by my side."
10892,182,1,30,ENTP,32,"<Yes>  I don't think there is much benefit to the conversation with a principled story, but only makes the story go round and round."
10893,182,1,30,ENTP,33,"<Yes>  Even if the background is completely different from mine, I can easily empathize with the person's situation. So I tend to listen to other people's stories."
10894,182,1,30,ENTP,34,"<no>  When I have to make a decision, I tend to make it as quickly as possible and then move on."
10895,182,1,30,ENTP,35,<no>  Even decisions that have already been made may be reconsidered depending on the circumstances. Because I don't think my decision is necessarily right.
10896,182,1,30,ENTP,36,"<no> On the weekends, I usually spend time alone to relieve fatigue. It feels like having a party or event on the weekend adds to the fatigue of the following week. You need time to clear your mind and recharge."
10897,182,1,30,ENTP,37,"<Yes>  I love art museums and art works, so I always visit famous art museums in each region or country."
10898,182,1,30,ENTP,38,<no>  I am good at understanding other people's feelings. You can often feel how a person is feeling just by looking at their facial expressions.
10899,182,1,30,ENTP,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan out my daily to-dos. Work is planned and carried out on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis, and personal work is always carefully planned on a calendar or notepad. You seem to like planning."
10900,182,1,30,ENTP,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. Originally, I wasn't like that, but after going through a big trauma while working, I developed an anxiety disorder and now go to the hospital."
10901,182,1,30,ENTP,41,"<no>  I have no objection to making phone calls in particular. Rather, a phone call is often more convenient than an IM or text message."
10902,182,1,30,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  I've spent a lot of time trying to understand why that person thinks the way they do, why they're different from mine, to understand opinions that are very different from mine. This is especially true in situations of disagreement with the person you live with."
10903,182,1,30,ENTP,43,<no>  It's rare for me to contact a friend first. It seems that most of my friends contact me to meet first.
10904,182,1,30,ENTP,44,"<Yes> If there is a problem with the plan, we try to correct it immediately and get back to the original plan. I had a project to do recently, but there was a problem with the schedule. So I have the experience of correcting the schedule right away and returning to the plan."
10905,182,1,30,ENTP,45,"<Yes>  I often regret the mistakes I made a long time ago. These days, I continue to regret a change in my course many years ago when I was swept away by circumstances."
10906,182,1,30,ENTP,46,<no>  often think about what humans live for and why. Because that's one of the reasons why I'm anxious in my life.
10907,182,1,30,ENTP,47,"<neutrality>  I try to control my emotions, but I also seem to be swayed by them. People around me evaluate me as being on the side of suppressing and controlling my emotions."
10908,182,1,30,ENTP,48,"<Yes>  Even when the other person is wrong, I try to save the other person's face so that the other person is not ashamed."
10921,183,1,30,ISFJ,1,"<no>  I am a person who is reluctant to try new things, so I do not make new friends unless it is necessary because I feel difficulties or discomfort in new relationships."
10922,183,1,30,ISFJ,2,"<neutrality> Rather than exploring various interests, I tend to focus on a few interests, so I don't spend a lot of time exploring or devoting myself to them. I used to be interested in home gardening, but these days I'm interested in mobile games, financial technology, and pregnancy and childbirth."
10923,183,1,30,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  I consider myself an emotional person. In fact, I often shed tears while watching movies, documentaries, or comic books, but when I see someone else crying, I feel hurt or depressed along with it."
10924,183,1,30,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  tend to get very stressed out when my plans get disrupted or go wrong. I often feel this in myself when I work at a company or write a household account book. I know myself to some extent, so I tend to prepare a countermeasure. When writing a household account book, one way to prepare for unexpected expenses is to create several bankbooks for each purpose."
10925,183,1,30,ISFJ,5,"<neutrality>  don't think it's easy to maintain composure in a high-pressure environment, but I think it depends on the environment. In particular, I could feel the pressure I felt a lot when I was working at the company or studying, but when the pressure is applied to the company work, it is difficult to maintain a good rating. This is because the burden of having to complete the work within the given time according to the instructions from the top is too great. On the other hand, when I study for the certification I want to achieve, there is pressure due to the test date, but it is a promise and a fight with myself without harming others, so I do not feel the pressure as much as the company work."
10926,183,1,30,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  As I answered in the first question, I tend to sit near people I know and talk to people I know even when I go to a meeting because I find it uncomfortable and difficult to meet and relate to new people."
10927,183,1,30,ISFJ,7,"<Yes>  tend to do it because I think it's right to start another project after completely completing one project. Because projects and general tasks are different, the company prioritizes completing projects before starting new ones."
10928,183,1,30,ISFJ,8,"<Yes>  I consider myself more sentimental than others. The reason is because I think they have great empathy. Because of this, I have often been pointed out that I am sad, angry, and happy because of excessive empathy from those around me."
10929,183,1,30,ISFJ,9,"<neutrality>  I tend to make plans to efficiently accomplish my goals rather than like making plans. I usually make a plan when I go on a repetitive company business or travel, but there are many cases where other things are not kept as planned, so I do not write a diary separately."
10930,183,1,30,ISFJ,10,"<no>  I do not question my abilities or knowledge over small mistakes. Because I tend to believe in myself. When I make a big mistake, I sometimes cling to myself, but unless that's the case, I don't think there's any need to undermine my self-esteem by blaming myself."
10931,183,1,30,ISFJ,11,"<no>  don't think it's easy because I tend to think it's difficult for people who are interested in meeting for the first time. Even if they were interested, in most cases they weren't the first to approach."
10932,183,1,30,ISFJ,12,"<no>  I'm not really interested in the artwork itself, so I prefer to think for myself rather than discussing a movie or a book rather than an art piece."
10933,183,1,30,ISFJ,13,"<no> It is not easy for me to act rationally when a problem arises. Because of my emotional inclination, I often hear that I am frustrated because I am easily swayed here and there."
10934,183,1,30,ISFJ,14,"<no>  I'm not very good at making plans, but I tend to make plans to achieve goals efficiently. Where efficiency is not required, planning is meaningless, and improvisation is reluctant because of a distaste for adventure and sudden change."
10935,183,1,30,ISFJ,15,"<no>  I used to care a lot about what other people thought of me. Hachiman: I recently realized something through reading, so I'm trying my best not to do that."
10936,183,1,30,ISFJ,16,"<no>  Rather than enjoying group activities, I am the type of person who feels pleasure in enjoying something alone or in a small group. These days, as usual, I have time to enjoy hobbies by myself."
10937,183,1,30,ISFJ,17,"<neutrality>  I like books and movies that leave a lasting impression. Usually, such books and movies have open endings or offer multiple interpretations. I recently watched a movie called 'Persona' and I remember watching it with interest."
10938,183,1,30,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality>  always keep in mind the sentence 'I can help others only when I do well'. The generosity of helping others succeed is because I think that only when I do well can I properly demonstrate myself. Still, he is not stingy in helping others and finds great satisfaction in helping others."
10939,183,1,30,ISFJ,19,"<no>  I'm not very interested in it. It's because I don't like loud things in vulgar words. I don't have a lot of interests, but when I'm stuck on one interest, I tend to be passionately immersed."
10940,183,1,30,ISFJ,20,"<no>  I used to live with worries, but as I grew up, there were many times when I felt that the more I worried, the more I made things that didn't exist. Worrying doesn't solve it, so I try hard not to worry."
10941,183,1,30,ISFJ,21,"<Yes> Since I have a personality that avoids group life, I think that taking on the role of a leader in group life is a rat poison for me. I'm of the opinion that it's not possible, but something I absolutely want to avoid."
10942,183,1,30,ISFJ,22,"<no>  I'm not very interested in artistic things, but I don't think that I don't have an artistic inclination, just hate the hassle of making, drawing, and writing. When I was young, I was very good at writing and making, so I received many awards and often received praise."
10943,183,1,30,ISFJ,23,"<neutrality>  I answered neutral, but it is an opinion close to no. The world cannot be controlled by reason alone or by emotion alone. One thing is for sure, I don't think it would have been a proper world if it had been controlled."
10944,183,1,30,ISFJ,24,"<Yes>  tend to like clean surroundings. Taking a break in a clean environment makes you feel more refreshed, and you feel better about studying, eating, and sleeping in a clean environment. So I tend to clean every day."
10945,183,1,30,ISFJ,25,<no>  I'm not very fond of arguing. I'm not the type to enjoy even looking at an argument because I don't feel refreshed from a third party's point of view because I feel like I'm fighting something.
10946,183,1,30,ISFJ,26,<Yes>  I'm not the type to seek attention because I don't like the attention of others. It's because I feel uncomfortable when someone pays attention to me.
10947,183,1,30,ISFJ,27,"<neutrality>  am an emotional person, so I am often swept away by my own emotions. I tend to experience changes in emotions quickly, such as depression, sadness, and happiness, and at one time I experienced bipolar symptoms for this reason. For example, even in the middle of a fight, my feelings change with every word I say."
10948,183,1,30,ISFJ,28,"<neutrality>  I believe that each person has a different job and not everyone can be efficient. However, there are times when I get annoyed when I bump into someone who is not efficient at work. I understand, but I think it can't be helped depending on the situation."
10949,183,1,30,ISFJ,29,"<Yes>  I tend to pursue doing things in advance as much as possible, but sometimes I put things off until the end when I get used to the work. Depending on the need, there are times when urgent business is dealt with first and then the work is postponed until the end. In particular, I often postpone tasks that I don't want to do or that are complicated."
10950,183,1,30,ISFJ,30,<Yes>  I tend to be curious about mysterious or mysterious things. That's why I think the afterlife is one of the topics that I'm curious about and interesting. I wonder if it's because it's an area that humans don't know.
10951,183,1,30,ISFJ,31,"<no>  I tend to seek to spend time alone when I am alone. These days, alone time is free and enjoyable."
10952,183,1,30,ISFJ,32,"<Yes>  I'm not really interested in the discussion itself, so I don't watch the discussions on TV either. It's hard to concentrate and I think it's boring."
10953,183,1,30,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  can't answer that I don't, nor can I, easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds. It's usually difficult to relate to people from good backgrounds because they're from backgrounds I've never had, but I tend to sympathize with people from bad backgrounds for some reason."
10954,183,1,30,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  gave a neutral answer because I think it depends on the situation when it comes to making decisions. However, there are usually times when a decision made after thinking about it is not a very right decision, so if you think that an answer will not come out even if you judge the situation a lot, you make a decision early, and in the opposite case, you make a decision after thinking about it for a long time. Also. There is no better worry depending on whether it is long or short, and regrets following the decision are my share."
10955,183,1,30,ISFJ,35,"<no>  I used to make a lot of connections after making a decision, but I'm trying not to do that lately. It's an effort to accept my regrets about the decisions I've made."
10956,183,1,30,ISFJ,36,<no>  I prefer alone time because I value delicious food and free time alone rather than a fun party.
10957,183,1,30,ISFJ,37,<no>  I tend to prefer going to the cinema to going to art galleries. It's because I'm not the type to enjoy appreciating static works.
10958,183,1,30,ISFJ,38,<no>  am good at understanding other people's feelings. I tend to understand and comfort others when they are struggling or facing difficulties.
10959,183,1,30,ISFJ,39,"<no>  I think it's inefficient to make a plan for what happens every day. When it comes to work, I often make plans, but I think planning every day is really tiring."
10960,183,1,30,ISFJ,40,"<no>  am a person who buys and feels insecure. I try not to worry, but it's not easy to control my anxious mind. However, I am trying to refrain from this through reading recently."
10961,183,1,30,ISFJ,41,"<Yes>  I'm the type of person who doesn't like talking on the phone. I don't have confidence in my voice, and I tend to express my emotions in my voice, so I don't talk on the phone unless it's absolutely necessary."
10962,183,1,30,ISFJ,42,"<neutrality>  I used to get angry when opinions differed from mine, but as I grew up, I corrected this a lot. There are people with different opinions in the world, and it is natural that I am different from others. Even now I have a hard time understanding very different opinions, but I don't want to spend a lot of time and I don't get angry."
10963,183,1,30,ISFJ,43,"<no>  enjoy spending time alone, so I'm not the type to actively ask to meet someone first."
10964,183,1,30,ISFJ,44,"<neutrality>  If there is a setback in my plan, I tend to prepare other plans to prepare for, rather than trying to go back as much as possible. In particular, when I go on a trip, things can go awry from what I had planned, but in that situation, it's not easy to get back to the original plan, so I tend to implement other plans as a contingency plan."
10965,183,1,30,ISFJ,45,<Yes>  I often regret my past mistakes. But now I'm trying not to dwell on the past.
10966,183,1,30,ISFJ,46,"<neutrality>  I often think about the reason for human existence and life. When I was young, I often thought deeply out of curiosity, but as I grow older, I tend to try to buy the present without attaching much meaning to it."
10967,183,1,30,ISFJ,47,"<Yes>  I am an emotional person, but it is not easy to control my emotions, so I am often swayed by my emotions. People around you are criticized for that reason, but it is not easy to control your mind."
10968,183,1,30,ISFJ,48,"<no>  don't take the side of the other person when it's obvious that it's their fault. Rather, I think it should be criticized when the fault is obvious. It's because I think it's the way to benefit the other person."
10981,184,0,30,ENFJ,1,"<no>  It's because I don't feel lonely even when I'm alone, and I feel that the time I spend with my family is more precious."
10982,184,0,30,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  Most of my free time is devoted to exploring new interests. Lately, I've been devoting my time to getting information about finances or side hustles."
10983,184,0,30,ENFJ,3,"<neutrality>  Just because someone else is crying doesn't make me want to cry either. If you can sympathize with the reason why that person is crying, you will want to cry too."
10984,184,0,30,ENFJ,4,"<neutrality>  It seems to depend on the severity of the job. In the case of an issue that has a great impact on my life, I tend to make various preparations, whereas in the case of a light issue, I am not very stressed about the outcome."
10985,184,0,30,ENFJ,5,"<Yes>  A high-pressure environment is, after all, a moment at a critical crossroads in my life. In such an important situation, I try to keep my composure in order to achieve better results. I recently had an important exam, and even then I tried to keep my composure as much as possible."
10986,184,0,30,ENFJ,6,<neutrality>  tend to talk to people I already know and then approach new people I'm interested in. This is because the purpose of attending a party or event is to get to know someone new.
10987,184,0,30,ENFJ,7,"<Yes>  I usually try to start another project after finishing one project. If you start working on another before you finish one perfectly, you feel a little uncomfortable."
10988,184,0,30,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  am very sentimental in everything. However, it seems to be limited to things related to myself or my family. It can be said that it is rather cold when it comes to things related to others."
10989,184,0,30,ENFJ,9,"<no>  Unless there is a complicated schedule involved, most of the work is improvised. I hate writing a diary. However, in the case of an important date, the date should be marked on the calendar."
10990,184,0,30,ENFJ,10,"<no>  I think people are bound to make mistakes in life. Even though I made those mistakes, I never doubted my ability or knowledge. Mistakes are natural and make me better."
10991,184,0,30,ENFJ,11,"<Yes>  It's easy to start a conversation, but I tend to hold back on purpose. Even if we do talk, we try not to have deep conversations."
10992,184,0,30,ENFJ,12,"<no>  I really enjoy giving various interpretations to most things, not just works of art. That's enough to say that it's a pleasure in life."
10993,184,0,30,ENFJ,13,"<neutrality>  Important things must be followed by reason, and lightly decisions are usually left to emotions. People around me mostly looked at me as a person who made rational decisions."
10994,184,0,30,ENFJ,14,"<Yes>  only make a rough plan for the day, and other than that, I tend to improvise what I want to do."
10995,184,0,30,ENFJ,15,<no>  I care very much about how I appear to others. It seems that there is a desire to be seen as a good person to the other person.
10996,184,0,30,ENFJ,16,"<no>  I mostly enjoy solo activities. I get along well when I participate in group activities, but basically I enjoy spending time alone."
10997,184,0,30,ENFJ,17,"<Yes>  This is often referred to as an open ending. I like such works because they leave a lot of room for thought. Among the dramas I recently watched, I think I liked the drama called 'Hwanhon'."
10998,184,0,30,ENFJ,18,<no>  I tend to feel overwhelming satisfaction from my own success rather than the success of others. Who would rejoice in the success of others more than their own?
10999,184,0,30,ENFJ,19,<no>  I don't know because I've never seen it because I have so many interests that I can't handle it. I tend to focus only on things I can handle.
11000,184,0,30,ENFJ,20,"<neutrality>  I have a very optimistic personality, so I don't worry too much about small things. However, the success or failure of important tasks is often worrisome. I can't decide if it's a success or not."
11001,184,0,30,ENFJ,21,"<Yes>  I try to avoid taking on leadership roles whenever possible. Leaders have great responsibilities. So most of the time, I prefer to take on the role of Lee In-ja."
11002,184,0,30,ENFJ,22,"<Yes>  I enjoy appreciating art, such as art and music, but I don't think I have any talent for making my own artistic work. I don't remember being good at it since I was young."
11003,184,0,30,ENFJ,23,"<no>  I tend to live rationally in my social life, but I think the world has been developed by emotional people."
11004,184,0,30,ENFJ,24,<no>  I tend to finish my chores after I get enough rest. Doing housework before a break in itself is too stressful.
11005,184,0,30,ENFJ,25,"<neutrality> In fact, I'm not really interested in other people's arguments. Unless it's related to me, I don't pay much attention to it."
11006,184,0,30,ENFJ,26,"<no>  Rather, I tend to try to get other people's attention. No matter what you do, if no one sees it, it means nothing."
11007,184,0,30,ENFJ,27,<no>  I tend to be inert with my emotions. Just because you're sad and something good suddenly happens doesn't make you feel better right away.
11008,184,0,30,ENFJ,28,"<Yes>  From my point of view, there is a way to handle things more efficiently, but I get annoyed when I see people who don't do it that way, or who don't have the will."
11009,184,0,30,ENFJ,29,"<no>  If it's something I have to do, I usually do it first and then do other things. That way, when you are resting, you can rest properly."
11010,184,0,30,ENFJ,30,"<no>  have the idea that there might be an afterlife, but I don't find it interesting. The present life I am living right now is more important."
11011,184,0,30,ENFJ,31,<no>  Spending time with other people feels like work. I think true relaxation is possible when you are alone.
11012,184,0,30,ENFJ,32,"<Yes>  I'm not very interested in discussions that don't directly relate to me. For example, politicians' discussions on TV are boring."
11013,184,0,30,ENFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I tend to empathize easily with people from different backgrounds, but I cannot empathize deeply. I think it's just superficial empathy."
11014,184,0,30,ENFJ,34,"<no>  If I have to make a decision, I don't procrastinate. I don't think delaying it will make any difference."
11015,184,0,30,ENFJ,35,"<Yes> To be precise, I tend not to reconsider decisions I cannot change. Thinking about a decision you can't change already won't change anything."
11016,184,0,30,ENFJ,36,<no>  Participating in parties and events with other people is another job. I think true relaxation is possible by spending time alone.
11017,184,0,30,ENFJ,37,"<Yes>  enjoy contemplating the intentions of the creators while appreciating works of art. As a movie, it's like an open ending, so I like it."
11018,184,0,30,ENFJ,38,"<no>  I am good at understanding other people's feelings. Generally speaking, they are quick-witted. Rather, if you know the feelings of others, there was a case of pretending not to know each other."
11019,184,0,30,ENFJ,39,"<no> Even if I make a plan, I only make a rough plan, and I don't make a specific plan. However, if you have a problem that you can't handle without making a plan, you will make a plan."
11020,184,0,30,ENFJ,40,"<neutrality>  I think everyone lives with feeling insecure. However, there are only those who hide the anxiety and those who reveal it. Even if I feel anxious, I am not very stressed."
11021,184,0,30,ENFJ,41,"<Yes>  prefer texting over phone calls. In the case of a phone call, unlike texting, it is because the words once spoken cannot be picked up."
11022,184,0,30,ENFJ,42,"<no>  I'm not trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. Most of the time, I just think I'm right and move on."
11023,184,0,30,ENFJ,43,"<no>  Usually, the other person contacts me first, and it seems that it is rare for me to ask to meet first."
11024,184,0,30,ENFJ,44,"<no>  If the plan is disrupted, I tend to try to change to a new plan rather than trying to go back to the original plan."
11025,184,0,30,ENFJ,45,"<no>  I tend not to regret things that have already passed. Even if you regret it, it doesn't mean that you can erase the mistakes you've already made."
11026,184,0,30,ENFJ,46,<Yes> We do not think deeply about the existence of human beings and the reason for living. But I tend to think deeply about my existence and the reason for my life.
11027,184,0,30,ENFJ,47,<no>  I don't think I've ever been swayed by emotions since I became an adult. I think people around me evaluate me as a rational person.
11028,184,0,30,ENFJ,48,"<neutrality> It seems to depend on whether the other person is important to me or not. If it's someone important to me, I tend to try to save face even if the other person's fault is obvious."
11041,185,1,20,ESTP,1,"<Yes>  I regularly make new friends. The reason is that it is important to expand personal connections through activities such as student councils, small groups, and clubs at school."
11042,185,1,20,ESTP,2,"<Yes> I'm the kind of person who can't stand things that I'm interested in and curious about, so I always search for things like that on YouTube or Google. These days, I'm interested in program development, so I'm looking for a lot of related videos."
11043,185,1,20,ESTP,3,"<neutrality>  When I see someone else crying, it depends. If it's a situation I can relate to, or if it's a situation I've been through, I think I'll cry because the images of me and the other person overlap. But if empathy doesn't go well, I don't bother crying."
11044,185,1,20,ESTP,4,"<no>  I don't make multiple contingency plans in case things go wrong. The reason is because you don't imagine when something goes wrong, and you have faith that it will work out unconditionally."
11045,185,1,20,ESTP,5,"<Yes>  maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. The reason is that if I am embarrassed, other people will look at me strangely. Recently, at a club dinner, there was a situation where executives stood up to introduce themselves and say a word of determination, but I'm not good at standing in front of other people. However, since I am standing in the position of an executive, I spoke confidently and proudly."
11046,185,1,20,ESTP,6,"<Yes>  tend to talk to people I already know at parties and events. The reason is that it's fun to meet new people and talk to them, but people you already know are a little more comfortable, and because you have common interests, you can easily draw up a conversation topic."
11047,185,1,20,ESTP,7,"<no>  start another project without fully completing one. The reason is because I have a tendency to start a job and work on it later. Even if I work on several projects at the same time, I have never failed to finish them on time. I have a lot of things I want to do, so even if it seems a bit daunting, I tend to start unconditionally."
11048,185,1,20,ESTP,8,"<no> I'm not very sentimental. The reason is that when we say sentimental, we usually say that we are overly sad or easily pleased, but when something sad happens, for example, it doesn't mean that we can't live by thinking about it all day or several days."
11049,185,1,20,ESTP,9,"<neutrality>  I like to make plans with a schedule or list. The reason is that I often organize my schedule on my iPad. I like making plans, but I have a hard time actually implementing them."
11050,185,1,20,ESTP,10,"<no>  I do not doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. The reason is because people think that everyone learns by making mistakes. Recently, the professor scolded me for not being able to keep up with the classes I majored in, but I didn't get discouraged and thought that I should work harder in the future."
11051,185,1,20,ESTP,11,"<no>  I find it difficult to approach and start a conversation with someone I am interested in. The reason is that if there is someone I am interested in, I tend to watch them from a distance. I think I will make a mistake by approaching him first and then asking questions that may be rude to him."
11052,185,1,20,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  I am not at all interested in discussing the different interpretations of works of art. The reason is that I don't even like looking at art, and I find it boring, so I'm even less interested in discussing it."
11053,185,1,20,ESTP,13,"<neutrality>  am neutral. If I have a lot of selfishness about something, I think that rational judgment is correct, but I actually follow emotional judgment. But when you're sober about your work, only your rational judgment follows. The evaluations around me say that I make a lot of emotional judgments."
11054,185,1,20,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  like to improvise my day schedule and do whatever I want to do. The reason is that not everything in life can go back to plan. Given the potential for things to go wrong, it's less stressful to improvise than to live deliberately."
11055,185,1,20,ESTP,15,"<no>  tend to worry a lot about how I appear to others. The reason is because bad rumors spread about me during my school days, I lost close friends, and I had a really hard time. I have developed a habit of always being careful about my words and actions wherever I go."
11056,185,1,20,ESTP,16,"<Yes>  I enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is that schools do activities such as student councils, clubs, small groups, and tutoring. Alone time is good, but doing group activities is more fun and I can release my energy."
11057,185,1,20,ESTP,17,"<no>  I don't like books and movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. The reason is that I don't like the books and movies themselves. And even if I get a chance to come across them, I hope the ending is fixed. It is better to think simple than to think complex."
11058,185,1,20,ESTP,18,"<no>  I feel more satisfaction from my success. The reason is that I am a proud person, and if I am a person who can afford it, I can afford to help others succeed, but my situation itself is not comfortable, so I always put myself first."
11059,185,1,20,ESTP,19,"<Yes>  have so many interests that I often don't know what to do next. The reason is that there are many things I have done, but I am not good at judging which ones to prioritize. Right now, I'm not sure which to prioritize between my schoolwork and my projects."
11060,185,1,20,ESTP,20,"<no>  I don't often worry about things going wrong. The reason is that I just want to do it, but I don't want to spend time thinking too much. I think it's efficient to do what needs to be done in the time to worry."
11061,185,1,20,ESTP,21,"<neutrality>  I'd like to try a leadership role in a group, but I'm not confident. The reason is that I want to lead others, but I don't have the confidence to play the role of a leader well. The position itself as a leader is burdensome, and I think it is difficult to meet the needs of all members."
11062,185,1,20,ESTP,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that I wanted to learn art and music during my school days, so I seriously set my career path there, but I thought that I had no talent and could not do better than other people who are good at it even if I tried hard."
11063,185,1,20,ESTP,23,"<Yes>  think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. The reason is that people do a lot of actions that shouldn't be committed by emotions, so I think that the world would be less dizzy if everyone made rational judgments."
11064,185,1,20,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I like to finish my chores before going to bed. The reason is that if you finish your housework first, you will not only be able to relax in a pleasant environment, but you will not have the stress of doing housework while you are resting."
11065,185,1,20,ESTP,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that when I hear different thoughts on the same question, I can see a position I did not think of, and I feel that there are people who think this way, and that everyone is not the same as me."
11066,185,1,20,ESTP,26,"<Yes>  I try not to attract other people's attention. The reason is that I'm worried that if I make a mistake by drawing attention, I'll plant a bad image in others. I'm quiet when I go to a certain meeting, but I think it would be nice if it wasn't an environment where everyone remembers me."
11067,185,1,20,ESTP,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. The reason is that when you're in a situation where your emotions change quickly, you don't think about it. When such a situation occurs and you recognize it only after some time has passed, your emotions do not fluctuate greatly."
11068,185,1,20,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed with people who aren't as effective as I am. The reason is that you can easily handle things, but it is frustrating to hold on to them for a long time. So when that situation arises around me, I tell the other person how to handle something efficiently."
11069,185,1,20,ESTP,29,<Yes>  I put things off until the end. The reason is that I think that using my break time as long as possible and doing what I have to do on a deadline is much better and more efficient than doing it with a deadline left.
11070,185,1,20,ESTP,30,"<no>  I don't find the question of the afterlife interesting. The reason is because I think that when a person dies, that is the end. It's hard to understand people who talk about it because we don't know if there really is an afterlife."
11071,185,1,20,ESTP,31,"<Yes>  would rather spend time with other people than alone. The reason is that I have a lot of random thoughts when I'm alone, but when I'm with other people, I can focus on the other person without those thoughts, and it's more fun to be with other people."
11072,185,1,20,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I think principled stories are boring. The reason is that practice is more fun than theory, and I hate fundamental stories like history."
11073,185,1,20,ESTP,33,"<no>  I don't easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds. The reason is that although I know that people's backgrounds are all different, empathy for that person's situation is understandable only when the situation is similar to mine."
11074,185,1,20,ESTP,34,"<no>  I don't put off making decisions until the end. The reason is that thinking about something first is the correct answer. Of course, everything has its pros and cons, but the longer you think about it, the harder it is to make a choice, so when you have a decision to make, you make it right away."
11075,185,1,20,ESTP,35,"<Yes>  I don't rethink decisions I've already made. The reason is because it was my choice, so I feel that there is nothing to change just by thinking about it again, and I don't like it when the direction of work is different from what I thought before."
11076,185,1,20,ESTP,36,"<Yes> Rather than spending time alone, I tend to relieve the fatigue of the week with fun parties and events. The reason is that there are a lot of group meetings and events because schools are open these days, and it's fun to listen to other people's current situation and talk about me."
11077,185,1,20,ESTP,37,"<no>  I hate appreciating works of art. The reason is that they hate to appreciate art and consider the act itself a waste of time. People who are interested in it have a hobby of appreciating works of art, but I don't think so."
11078,185,1,20,ESTP,38,"<neutrality>  I like to understand other people's feelings depending on the situation. The reason is that if I have experienced or can empathize, I can understand that feeling more easily than anyone else, but it is difficult to understand easily if it is something I have not experienced."
11079,185,1,20,ESTP,39,<no>  don't like to plan my daily to-dos. The reason is that living with a plan every day is tiring. I think it's best not to create a situation like that than to be so stressed because I get a lot of stress when a certain schedule goes wrong.
11080,185,1,20,ESTP,40,"<Yes>  I rarely feel insecure. The reason is that in my teens, I had anxiety over trivial things, but as I entered my 20s, I started to trust every choice I made."
11081,185,1,20,ESTP,41,"<no>  I like making phone calls. The reason is that when you are having a conversation using a messenger, there are often situations in which the conversation is cut off in real time, and I don't think that's a good thing. I think using the phone is much more convenient."
11082,185,1,20,ESTP,42,"<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. The reason is that when such a situation comes, I just think that there are people who have that opinion, and I think it is a waste of time to spend extra time to understand that person beyond that."
11083,185,1,20,ESTP,43,"<Yes>  tend to contact my friends to meet up first. The reason is that if I don't contact you first, I think we need to meet periodically, fearing that the relationship will end or become awkward."
11084,185,1,20,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  If my plan is disrupted, I try to get back to it as quickly as possible. The reason is that the work itself is very stressful when there is a setback in the plan, and if it is not resolved quickly, it will drag on the work more and there is no motivation to do it."
11085,185,1,20,ESTP,45,"<no>  I do not regret the mistakes of so long ago. The reason is that I was a person of the past, so I must have learned from the mistakes I made then, and I think I grew up based on that."
11086,185,1,20,ESTP,46,<Yes>  don't think deeply about human existence and why we live. The reason is because I think I live because I was just born. I think it's more efficient to do other things than spend time thinking about that.
11087,185,1,20,ESTP,47,<Yes>  I tend to be swayed by emotions. The reason is that a lot of wrong things have always happened because of emotions. I hear stories from people around me that I am swayed by emotions.
11088,185,1,20,ESTP,48,"<no>  I say they are wrong when it is clear that the other person is wrong. The reason is because I think that people around me need someone who tells me that I am wrong, rather than covering up for my wrongdoing, whether I am close or not."
11101,186,1,30,ISFP,1,"<no> The process of meeting new people and getting to know them is stressful, so I tend not to make new friends. The friends I'm close with right now are enough."
11102,186,1,30,ISFP,2,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type of person who tries hard to find something, but I tend to be interested in it naturally. Recently, I became interested in resin crafting videos on YouTube."
11103,186,1,30,ISFP,3,"<neutrality>  If you sympathize with the reason someone else is crying, you want to cry, and if you can't empathize, you wonder why they are crying."
11104,186,1,30,ISFP,4,"<no>  I don't think about the future, so I don't set up a separate plan. Even if things go wrong, I think it will work out somehow."
11105,186,1,30,ISFP,5,"<no>  When the pressure is high, I often let go of the opposite sex. I recently went to a company interview, and it was a pressure interview, so the level of questions was high, so I couldn't answer properly and it was difficult to manage my expression."
11106,186,1,30,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I'm the type who doesn't like people themselves, and it's nice to be comfortable with someone I know. Introducing yourself to someone new is stressful in itself."
11107,186,1,30,ISFP,7,"<no>  I tend to do many things at once because I am the type to start and see things. The data labeling I'm doing now is also something that I receive and do, but I'm trying to work with a good balance."
11108,186,1,30,ISFP,8,"<Yes>  I don't think it's sentimental. First of all, it's because I don't have an artistic sense or sensibility, and I'm not the type to express it tastefully."
11109,186,1,30,ISFP,9,"<Yes>  I like to plan for a day, a week, a month. I use both a diary and a cell phone, but I usually organize my long-term plans, such as a week and a month, in my diary, and my daily plans on my cell phone."
11110,186,1,30,ISFP,10,"<neutrality>  It's not often, but on days when I make a lot of toxic little mistakes, I end up belittling myself. Recently, because of my poor physical condition, I have made many mistakes that I would not normally make, and I have fallen into a sense of shame."
11111,186,1,30,ISFP,11,"<no>  I'm on the timid side, so even if I'm interested, it's hard to approach and talk to me easily. That's why I think it's a waste to think about the missed opportunity to get to know each other now."
11112,186,1,30,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in works of art, and I do not prefer them because I think that interpretation of works of art is difficult."
11113,186,1,30,ISFP,13,"<no>  I tend to follow my emotions in most situations. I hear a lot of evaluations that I act emotionally from people around me, and I think I put my emotions first."
11114,186,1,30,ISFP,14,"<no> First of all, I don't like things that deviate from my plan, so even if something I want to do spontaneously arises, I tend to make a plan for the next one."
11115,186,1,30,ISFP,15,"<neutrality>  Not often, but sometimes I worry. I don't care how my appearance looks to others, but I'm a bit concerned that my abilities will be evaluated as low."
11116,186,1,30,ISFP,16,"<no>  really hate group activities. I feel most comfortable working alone or with a small group of people. These days, I'm working alone, and it's nice that I'm not stressed out by other people."
11117,186,1,30,ISFP,17,"<neutrality>  It's good to leave some room for interpretation, but I don't think it's good to be interpreted too freely because it looks irresponsible."
11118,186,1,30,ISFP,18,"<neutrality>  I think it depends on the situation and how you relate to other people. When a close friend of mine gets help from me and succeeds, I feel proud like my work."
11119,186,1,30,ISFP,19,<no>  I don't have that kind of experience because my interests aren't that diverse. So you can focus on one interest.
11120,186,1,30,ISFP,20,"<Yes>  Things don't go well just because I work hard, and I think there are some things that depend on luck, so I tend to worry until the work is completely finished."
11121,186,1,30,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to take on a leadership role, but I'd rather avoid a position with a lot of responsibility because it's too burdensome."
11122,186,1,30,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  Since I was young, I have not had any talent for art or music, and I don't think I have a strong interest in art."
11123,186,1,30,ISFP,23,"<Yes>  It won't be perfect, but I think it will be better than the current situation. I think most conflicts happen because emotions are important."
11124,186,1,30,ISFP,24,<Yes>  prefer to finish my chores and rest because taking a break doesn't feel like taking a break if there's still chores left over.
11125,186,1,30,ISFP,25,<Yes>  I like it because I can learn various perspectives or thoughts through other people's arguments.
11126,186,1,30,ISFP,26,"<neutrality>  I don't like to be noticed by a lot of people, but I like to be noticed by a few people. I think it's a timid gwanjong in vulgar words."
11127,186,1,30,ISFP,27,"<Yes> Emotions come and go several times a day. I get annoyed when things don't go well, but when I watch a video of my favorite celebrity, my mood suddenly improves."
11128,186,1,30,ISFP,28,"<Yes>  Honestly, there are times when I don't understand and get annoyed because I think that if I do enough, others won't do as well as I do."
11129,186,1,30,ISFP,29,"<Yes>  I can't do anything in advance and I tend to delay it as much as possible. Recently, I couldn't change my habit and procrastinated, so I blew up an opportunity to earn money."
11130,186,1,30,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  Actually, I don't believe in the afterlife, but I'm very interested in it because I'm afraid of the end after death, so I want to have an afterlife."
11131,186,1,30,ISFP,31,"<no>  It's not that I hate spending time with other people, but I'm still the most comfortable with being alone. I can't meet many people because of Corona, but I prefer to be alone, so I don't have the stress of not being able to meet people."
11132,186,1,30,ISFP,32,"<neutrality>  I think it's good to have a good balance. A story that is too fundamental is not fun, and I think there is no depth of discussion if the original story is completely omitted."
11133,186,1,30,ISFP,33,"<neutrality>  think it's important to understand a person's background. So I think there will be some parts that are difficult to relate to if the background is completely different, but I think I can sympathize to some extent because there are parts where people are there."
11134,186,1,30,ISFP,34,<Yes>  I tend to put off making decisions until I can. I decided in advance and postponed it as much as possible because there is a possibility that the situation will change.
11135,186,1,30,ISFP,35,"<neutrality>  I tend to rethink decisions that I think about a lot, and I don't think twice about decisions that I haven't given much thought to."
11136,186,1,30,ISFP,36,"<no>  Rather than parties or events, I prefer to spend my time quietly at home and relieve fatigue. Lately, I've been relaxing at home playing games without thinking."
11137,186,1,30,ISFP,37,"<no>  I have never been to an art gallery in my life. I'm not very interested in art, so I don't think I'll go to art museums in the future."
11138,186,1,30,ISFP,38,"<no>  think I'm good at understanding other people's feelings. When my friends consult with me or listen to stories on the Internet, I feel and empathize with them as if it were my work."
11139,186,1,30,ISFP,39,"<Yes>  It's so nice and fun to organize and plan to do every day. Instead, there are times when I am ashamed of myself because there are many times when I do not go according to the plan I made."
11140,186,1,30,ISFP,40,"<no>  There is no particular reason, and it seems like an innate personality. If you feel insecure, you lose yourself and there is no benefit."
11141,186,1,30,ISFP,41,"<neutrality>  Originally, I hated talking on the phone, but I naturally overcame it after starting a social life and having a lot of things to call."
11142,186,1,30,ISFP,42,"<no>  I try to understand if it's a little different, but I don't spend time because I don't want to accommodate completely different opinions."
11143,186,1,30,ISFP,43,"<Yes>  I don't have many friends, but I like and value him that much, so I often contact him asking to meet him first."
11144,186,1,30,ISFP,44,"<no>  I tend to be a perfectionist, so if there is a problem with my plan, I will give up the plan altogether. Recently, I made plans to study for certification, but I suddenly got busy, so I gave up studying altogether."
11145,186,1,30,ISFP,45,<no>  I don't really regret it because it's a waste of time and there's no benefit to thinking about past mistakes.
11146,186,1,30,ISFP,46,"<neutrality>  Not often, but sometimes I think about it. I often wonder why only humans on Earth have such high intelligence and development, whether it's a coincidence or destiny."
11147,186,1,30,ISFP,47,<Yes>  I am often swayed by emotions. I often hear from friends and family that you often act emotionally.
11148,186,1,30,ISFP,48,"<neutrality> It depends on the degree of fault of the other party. If the mistake is minor, it saves face, but if it's a big mistake, I think saving face will be poison."
11161,187,1,30,ISFJ,1,"<no>  It's hard to consume new energy, so I don't bother trying to make new friends."
11162,187,1,30,ISFJ,2,"<no>  I have a variety of interests, but I don't spend time exploring them, and I tend to stop at them."
11163,187,1,30,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  I am good at empathy, so I often cry with my friends when I listen to their concerns."
11164,187,1,30,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I¡¯m the type to worry a lot in advance, so I tend to always think of several countermeasures."
11165,187,1,30,ISFJ,5,"<neutrality>  It depends on the situation, but I tend to try to keep my composure even when deadlines are approaching. Of course, it may not be the case depending on the situation."
11166,187,1,30,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  tend to be shy, so I tend to talk to people I know first. As time goes on, I have to get used to the situation so it's comfortable to talk naturally with new people."
11167,187,1,30,ISFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I want to complete one project completely, so if not, I start another project, but I try to complete the previous one first."
11168,187,1,30,ISFJ,8,"<Yes>  There are emotional ups and downs, and even when watching a movie or having a conversation with an acquaintance, I fall into the emotions of the other person well."
11169,187,1,30,ISFJ,9,<Yes>  like to plan by buying a paper diary and writing down my schedule one by one.
11170,187,1,30,ISFJ,10,"<neutrality>  It's different depending on the situation at the time, but lately I can't remember that kind of experience."
11171,187,1,30,ISFJ,11,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to approach first, but when I'm curious, I tend to gather up the courage to start a conversation."
11172,187,1,30,ISFJ,12,<Yes>  I am not interested in discussing art because each work of art can have a different opinion.
11173,187,1,30,ISFJ,13,"<Yes> Although he tends to be emotional, he tries to make a rational decision when a situation comes up. The evaluation of the surroundings is also the same."
11174,187,1,30,ISFJ,14,"<Yes>  Most of the short trips are mostly improvised. Planning schedules are also interesting, but I think I enjoy being spontaneous."
11175,187,1,30,ISFJ,15,"<Yes>  Maybe it's because I transferred a lot when I was young, so I'm worried about how I look to other people."
11176,187,1,30,ISFJ,16,"<no>  In my 20s, I liked group activities, but in my 30s, I want to maintain a group activity rather than a group activity."
11177,187,1,30,ISFJ,17,"<no>  Rather than interpreting in my own way, I tend to accept the ending as it is. I tend to hate complicated things."
11178,187,1,30,ISFJ,18,<neutrality>  I think both have different charms. Both my success and the success of others are rewarding and satisfying.
11179,187,1,30,ISFJ,19,"<no>  Even if you have a lot of interests, most of them just stop thinking and continue on to something else."
11180,187,1,30,ISFJ,20,"<Yes> There is no particular trigger or reason, but I tend to think about things that have not happened in advance, so I often worry."
11181,187,1,30,ISFJ,21,"<Yes>  I tried to take on roles when I was a college student in my 20s or in my social life, but now I can't bear the weight of responsibility, so I want to avoid it as much as possible."
11182,187,1,30,ISFJ,22,"<neutrality>  I have a lot of desire to learn the artistic part, but I know very well that I don't have the skills, so I think I have little artistic inclination."
11183,187,1,30,ISFJ,23,"<no> Reason is important, but I think this world is maintained because there are emotions."
11184,187,1,30,ISFJ,24,"<no>  I tend to wash the dishes right away, but I tend to put off other chores and do the chores in droves."
11185,187,1,30,ISFJ,25,"<no>  Whether it's watching someone else's argument or me arguing, arguing is a headache."
11186,187,1,30,ISFJ,26,"<neutrality>  tend to blush quickly when I get someone's attention, so sometimes I try not to attract attention. However, with close acquaintances, he tries to attract attention and be funny."
11187,187,1,30,ISFJ,27,"<Yes>  There are many days when emotions go up and down in a day, so there are many times when I feel sorry for my spouse."
11188,187,1,30,ISFJ,28,<Yes>  I feel stuffy when I see people who are quick-tempered and inefficient at work.
11189,187,1,30,ISFJ,29,<Yes>  I tend to procrastinate as much as possible when it comes to personal things other than work.
11190,187,1,30,ISFJ,30,<no>  The question is not interesting because I am not curious about the afterlife or even think about it.
11191,187,1,30,ISFJ,31,<neutrality>  It's good to share the right time by thinking that time alone is also necessary and that it is necessary while spending time with others.
11192,187,1,30,ISFJ,32,"<neutrality>  I can't think of any special experience, but I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I think the original story is boring because it's not interesting."
11193,187,1,30,ISFJ,33,"<neutrality>  For example, I can sympathize with a friend's love counseling, but I don't think I can easily reach my heart for a friend's story that has different values or a different mindset from me."
11194,187,1,30,ISFJ,34,"<no>  He has a hasty personality and is a person who thinks and worries in advance, so he tries to make decisions in advance."
11195,187,1,30,ISFJ,35,"<neutrality>  No matter what decision you make, you don't know what will happen, so you try to accept it, but there are many times when you don't."
11196,187,1,30,ISFJ,36,"<neutrality>  I think it's important to spend time alone, so I have that time, and the energy I get from fun parties and events together is important, so I like both."
11197,187,1,30,ISFJ,37,"<Yes>  I don't have a great knowledge of art, but I like to go to art galleries from time to time and appreciate the work."
11198,187,1,30,ISFJ,38,<no>  I am good at understanding other people's feelings. I am good at listening to advice.
11199,187,1,30,ISFJ,39,"<Yes>  When I go to work, I tend to think about my priorities every morning and make a list."
11200,187,1,30,ISFJ,40,"<no>  I don't know what caused it, but it seems that I often feel insecure since I was young."
11201,187,1,30,ISFJ,41,<Yes>  I want to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible because texting is more comfortable than sharing my feelings through voice.
11202,187,1,30,ISFJ,42,"<no> If there is an opinion that is very different from mine, I'm a little embarrassed, but I'm the type to admit it right away, thinking that there must be a reason."
11203,187,1,30,ISFJ,43,"<no>  After starting a family, I rarely contact my friends to meet first."
11204,187,1,30,ISFJ,44,"<no>  I went on a trip to Bangkok, and I planned all the travel schedule, but my physical strength and weather capriciousness caused a setback in the plan, but I changed my plan to suit the situation and traveled."
11205,187,1,30,ISFJ,45,"<no> In the past, there were many times when I reflected on my mistakes and regretted them, but these days I have no time to think about the mistakes I made a long time ago. Stay true to the present."
11206,187,1,30,ISFJ,46,<Yes>  It seems that these days we are in a hurry to live while focusing on reality without thinking deeply about human existence and the reason for living.
11207,187,1,30,ISFJ,47,"<no>  He has a lot of emotional side, so his emotions are often fluctuating, but he quickly returns to his rational thoughts and is good at controlling his emotions, and people around him tell him that he is on the rational side."
11208,187,1,30,ISFJ,48,"<neutrality>  It will depend on the situation, but if you are morally good without committing a crime, I think you can try to save face depending on the situation, even if the other person's fault is obvious."
11221,188,0,30,INTJ,1,<no>  I feel pressured to be the first to make new friends. The reason is because it's more comfortable with old friends than making new friends.
11222,188,0,30,INTJ,2,<Yes>  I am currently interested in investing in stocks. The reason is that I am interested in getting to know companies by reading their financial situations and business plans.
11223,188,0,30,INTJ,3,"<Yes>  When I see people around me crying in dramas, movies, etc., sometimes I also cry. The situation is sympathetic and sad at the same time."
11224,188,0,30,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  I have at least two contingency plans. The reason is that when things go wrong, it is more comfortable to make preparations in advance rather than rushing to solve the situation."
11225,188,0,30,INTJ,5,"<Yes>  I am relatively good at maintaining my composure in difficult situations or when I feel pressured. The reason is because we live with the mindset of ""this too shall pass""."
11226,188,0,30,INTJ,6,"<Yes>  Most of the time I talk to people I already know. The reason is that until you know what kind of person the other person is, you feel the burden of approaching them first."
11227,188,0,30,INTJ,7,"<no>  I like to work on multiple projects together. The reason is that it's more fun to do several things together than to be immersed in one thing, and I don't get tired quickly."
11228,188,0,30,INTJ,8,<no>  I am usually far from being sentimental. I don't know why. I guess it's because of my innate temperament.
11229,188,0,30,INTJ,9,"<Yes>  I like to go ahead with a plan. The reason is that it's easier to plan ahead and stay organized. For example, if you are going on a trip, you plan ahead and travel rather than improvising."
11230,188,0,30,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  I feel that way when I make a mistake in something that is so obvious and easy. For example, when writing a document, if the other person points out a typo, I feel sorry for myself."
11231,188,0,30,INTJ,11,"<neutrality>  In my case, it seems to be different depending on the situation and environment. In a casual atmosphere or a social setting, I approach the person I am interested in first and have a conversation."
11232,188,0,30,INTJ,12,"<no>  I like to talk and discuss things like movies, even if it's not necessarily a great piece of art. The reason is that I enjoy telling my interpretation to others, and I think listening to other people's interpretations is the way to truly enjoy a work of art."
11233,188,0,30,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  tend to think rationally rather than reacting emotionally. When there is a conflicting opinion, we do not accept or express it emotionally, but we talk with specific reasons and logic. People around me also rate me that way."
11234,188,0,30,INTJ,14,"<Yes>  I start by planning something to do in the morning. Write down what you have to do today in your diary, and at the end of the day, check how much you have accomplished and finish it."
11235,188,0,30,INTJ,15,"<Yes>  I often worry about what others think of me. I think the reason is the biggest reason for the original temperament. In my head, I think it doesn't matter what the other person thinks, but in my heart, I notice a lot."
11236,188,0,30,INTJ,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy group activities. I like to be alone, so I rarely attend meetings."
11237,188,0,30,INTJ,17,"<Yes>  I like movies with ambiguous endings. The reason is that I think that works that can be interpreted in various ways have a deeper lingering effect than stories with clearly defined endings. It wasn't until recently, but I enjoyed watching the movie The Wailing."
11238,188,0,30,INTJ,18,"<neutrality>  sometimes care about helping others succeed. When the other person asks for help, they sincerely help, but it is rare for them to step forward and help. The reason is because I think it's presumptuous to help others when I'm not good enough myself."
11239,188,0,30,INTJ,19,<Yes>  I often put off things that I should be doing while paying attention to this and that. There are cases where problems arise because you are too preoccupied with things that are not necessarily important to you in life and you are unable to properly handle important things.
11240,188,0,30,INTJ,20,"<Yes>  I am a person with a lot of insecurities and worries. I think the reason for temperament is the biggest than there is a chance. You think it's nothing to worry about, but your heart and actual actions think otherwise."
11241,188,0,30,INTJ,21,"<neutrality>  may or may not want to be a group leader. The reason is that since I was young, I often unintentionally took on the role of leader. When everyone doesn't want to step out, the situation is frustrating and they volunteer to be the leader, but at the same time, they feel anxious and tired about being a leader, so they avoid it."
11242,188,0,30,INTJ,22,"<Yes>  I seem to be more of a thinking brain type than an artistic sensibility. The reason is that I enjoy art, but it is not a priority. Even if you buy something, practicality and price always take precedence over design."
11243,188,0,30,INTJ,23,"<neutrality>  I think both emotions and reason are important. If the world went back only to rational judgment, what fun would it be? I don't think that only rational judgment can benefit the world. I think that if we make rational and correct judgments, only a few will survive and all ordinary people will be weeded out. On the contrary, I can't imagine how disorderly society would be if we lived only with emotions."
11244,188,0,30,INTJ,24,"<Yes>  After work, I usually finish the housework that must be done today and take a break. The reason is because you want to rest properly. It's hard to get a proper rest if you don't finish all the work to do today."
11245,188,0,30,INTJ,25,<Yes>  I like arguments and discussions. The reason is that I like to hear thoughts from different perspectives.
11246,188,0,30,INTJ,26,"<neutrality>  I try not to attract attention, but I seem to tend to get attention. The reason is that the other person's eyes are burdensome, so they refrain from actions that attract attention. However, since I was young, there were many situations in which I received a lot of attention from people around me. So, it is better than not having interest at all, but excessive gaze and attention is burdensome."
11247,188,0,30,INTJ,27,"<no>  My emotions are calm. For example, I was told by a doctor that I would have to undergo major surgery due to a chronic illness. In the case of other people, I would react very emotionally, but in my case, I think I thought more about what to do next than my emotions."
11248,188,0,30,INTJ,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed when I behave inefficiently. In my experience, it's the same thing when working, and if you search and interest enough, you can do well, but I get annoyed when I see people who don't do that."
11249,188,0,30,INTJ,29,"<neutrality>  I remember that when I was in school, I put off studying for the test until the end and prepared by studying until dawn. However, since I started working, I have a sense of responsibility and finish my work in a hurry so as not to harm others."
11250,188,0,30,INTJ,30,<Yes>  I find conversations about undiscovered things like the afterlife fun. The reason is because the correct answer does not exist and it is fun to imagine.
11251,188,0,30,INTJ,31,"<no>  I prefer to be alone rather than spending time with other people. The reason is that it's fun when you meet, but your energy is quickly consumed and you're tired."
11252,188,0,30,INTJ,32,"<no>  I enjoy theory-based discussions. For example, in college, it is easier to understand than a boring class if you have a discussion even if it is fundamental."
11253,188,0,30,INTJ,33,"<Yes>  I easily empathize with people from different backgrounds. The reason is that people have different thoughts and live by trying to empathize with the world, thinking that it is a world where we all live together."
11254,188,0,30,INTJ,34,"<Yes>  Whether it's an important decision or a trivial decision, I think about it for a relatively long time. The reason is that we spend a lot of time worrying about what will happen as a result of our decision."
11255,188,0,30,INTJ,35,"<no>  It's a decision I've already made, but I'm thinking again. The reason is because I keep thinking about whether I made a good choice."
11256,188,0,30,INTJ,36,<no>  I mostly spend my free time alone. The reason is that spending time alone is comfortable and more fun.
11257,188,0,30,INTJ,37,<no>  I don't go to art galleries often. The reason is that they are not interested in art.
11258,188,0,30,INTJ,38,"<Yes>  I have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. For example, when I'm in the same situation as the other person, I don't think I'll react violently emotionally, but I often don't understand when I see the other person like that."
11259,188,0,30,INTJ,39,"<Yes>  usually prefer to plan my day and get things done. I go to work in the morning, plan what I will do today in my diary, and then start working."
11260,188,0,30,INTJ,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. The reason is like an innate temperament. I recognize that it is not a situation to be particularly anxious about, but my heart does not seem to follow me as I thought."
11261,188,0,30,INTJ,41,<Yes>  would like to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible. The reason is because it's hard to organize what you want to say on the phone. I prefer to show my opinion by thinking through text several times.
11262,188,0,30,INTJ,42,<Yes>  I often think about subjects on which I disagree. I often have that experience. I often think about what is right and wrong if my opinion is different from the other person's.
11263,188,0,30,INTJ,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to contact my friends first. The reason is that I like to be alone, so it is rare for me to contact you first."
11264,188,0,30,INTJ,44,"<no>  When my plan is disrupted, I don't get back to it quickly. In my case, I think again if the plan is problematic."
11265,188,0,30,INTJ,45,"<Yes>  I often regret even small mistakes. I made a mistake with a person because my words came out unintentionally, but I still feel sorry on the side of my heart."
11266,188,0,30,INTJ,46,<no>  often think about human existence and life. The reason is because I think it's embarrassing to live life inertia without thinking about 'why'.
11267,188,0,30,INTJ,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions. We tend to judge rationally rather than emotionally. People around me sometimes say that I have no soul.
11268,188,0,30,INTJ,48,"<neutrality>  will move on if the other person is polite and apologetic. However, they can also be mercilessly destroyed if they behave rudely and carelessly."
11281,189,0,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  Rather than thinking of making new friends periodically, it seems that I make new friends based on relationships."
11282,189,0,40,INFJ,2,"<neutrality>  One thing that seems to be important to me rather than various interests, especially these days, I am studying while looking for many books and information related to spirituality."
11283,189,0,40,INFJ,3,"<no>  I don't want to cry when I see someone I don't know crying. However, I tend to empathize with the situation you are in."
11284,189,0,40,INFJ,4,"<no>  Usually, I think preparing for when things go wrong is because I am not sure about what I am doing, so I tend to carefully examine whether what I am doing is right or not."
11285,189,0,40,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  Not only in a situation where I can't pay the rent properly because I have no income, but in any environment, I try to leave everything to God. This is my way to keep my composure."
11286,189,0,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  When I go to a gathering, I usually have a conversation with someone I already know. Because even talking to someone I already know is enough for me."
11287,189,0,40,INFJ,7,"<no>  It depends on what kind of project you are doing, but in my experience, it seems that I usually divide my time to do multiple projects."
11288,189,0,40,INFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I'm not very sentimental, but I tend to sympathize with the feelings of the people around me. Or even when you're walking down the street, reading a book you really like, or watching TV, there are times when you're momentarily sentimental about a part that resonates with you."
11289,189,0,40,INFJ,9,"<no>  I like to improvise because usually when I make a plan, things don't go as planned. And the results were often satisfactory."
11290,189,0,40,INFJ,10,"<no>  It is a mistake to think that what was right at first does not work as intended, but because ability is experience, I do not doubt my ability just because it does not work as I wish."
11291,189,0,40,INFJ,11,"<Yes>  When I was studying, if there was someone who was studying the same way, I was curious and asked first, and if there was information, I shared it."
11292,189,0,40,INFJ,12,"<neutrality>  I don't have experience with art works, but I tend to like various interpretations of certain events in my life, so I think I would be interested if I had the opportunity to interpret art works."
11293,189,0,40,INFJ,13,"<no>  I tend to ask my emotions at the end. No matter how good your idea is, you won't do it if you feel uncomfortable with your emotions. Thoughts are fallible, but emotions are always honest, so I tend to let emotions be the final decision. I'm not sure about the reviews around it. Because I've never asked anything like this before."
11294,189,0,40,INFJ,14,"<Yes>  like to improvise unless it's very important. Usually, there are cases where the day is over while planning a schedule, so I just like to improvise as time permits."
11295,189,0,40,INFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to be conscious of others. My specs are shabby compared to others, so how will others see me? I used to think like that."
11296,189,0,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  I don't have a lively personality, so I'm not the type who likes to join group activities first, or directly participate in activities. When I go out to a group activity, I will greet each other, and if so, what I do and ask about my personal life, but I do not have enough to introduce myself to someone, so I seem to be reluctant to do group activities."
11297,189,0,40,INFJ,17,"<Yes>  I especially like movies that are meaningful or far from over. When the movie is over, I like to think about the ending in my own way, looking for other people's thoughts by searching in the search bar or on these sites. It's a pity that I haven't been able to find such works lately."
11298,189,0,40,INFJ,18,"<Yes>  When something goes wrong, I tend to step in and help. If I willingly step forward and get good results, the people around me feel good, and I feel proud when I see it."
11299,189,0,40,INFJ,19,"<no>  can't think of anything more to be interested in because what I'm interested in now is enough for my future life. I'm studying spirituality, so I'm only interested in this one. Because I think this is the most important thing in life."
11300,189,0,40,INFJ,20,"<neutrality>  It usually seems to depend on the level of concern. I don't pay much attention to the worries I can handle, but the worries I can't handle don't even happen, but I'm already worried about them, and I tend to be dragged by them. But I tend to keep my composure right away."
11301,189,0,40,INFJ,21,<Yes>  Can I play a leadership role with my capabilities now? I think I will avoid it if such an opportunity comes.
11302,189,0,40,INFJ,22,"<no> If the artistic inclination is limited to playing something, drawing, and watching a movie, it may be possible, but I do not think that I do not have an artistic inclination because I can appreciate various things such as beauty, despair, and fierceness while looking at nature. ."
11303,189,0,40,INFJ,23,"<neutrality>  think emotions and reason should go together. If reason precedes emotion, the world becomes dry, and if emotion precedes reason, the world becomes cold. To create a warm and gentle world, I believe that emotion and reason should not be biased, and reason should ask emotion and emotion ask reason. do."
11304,189,0,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  If the place to rest is in the house, it would be more comfortable to finish the housework first and then relax."
11305,189,0,40,INFJ,25,"<neutrality>  Rather than having fun, because there are things to learn from other people's debates, especially because there may be parts where I can be right alone, I think it's necessary to see what other people's thoughts are and what other people's thoughts are looking at those thoughts. I think."
11306,189,0,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes> If you are driving and the car in front is not starting, the Klaxon will not sound. It's to avoid people around me being startled by the klaxon sound, or to avoid drawing attention to me."
11307,189,0,40,INFJ,27,"<Yes>  I try to keep my composure in any emotion, good or bad. If you are led by emotions, you will think of all sorts of things, and you will miss the present moment while imagining."
11308,189,0,40,INFJ,28,"<no>  I have no reason to be annoyed with others because I am not efficient myself. Of course, if other people are not able to do what I can do enough, it is enough to help them."
11309,189,0,40,INFJ,29,"<Yes> Right now, my phone is not in good condition, so I need to change it, but I keep putting it off. I'm holding on to see if there are better options."
11310,189,0,40,INFJ,30,<no>  I am not very interested in the afterlife. Because it is an area that cannot be experienced. I think it's enough to be interested in the reality right now.
11311,189,0,40,INFJ,31,"<neutrality> When you're with someone you like, you want to spend time with them, but if not, you'd rather spend time alone. These days, there are a lot of good people, so if I have time, I spend it talking to people rather than being alone."
11312,189,0,40,INFJ,32,"<Yes>  For example, I think it's better to sympathize with a friend who is angry than to judge whether the anger is right or wrong. After that, I think it's right to judge whether the theory or whatever is right or wrong."
11313,189,0,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  Although the environment and background are restricted, thoughts are free, so even if the background is completely different from mine, I can do what that person thought, so I don't think it's enough to empathize even if the background is completely different."
11314,189,0,40,INFJ,34,"<Yes> When I feel I have to do something, I tend to put it off until the end. Once I had the thought of doing something, there were many things that I put off because I thought again and again and again and again."
11315,189,0,40,INFJ,35,"<no>  I don't think twice about impromptu decisions, but I tend to think again about decisions made after thinking for a long time."

11317,189,0,40,INFJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't like it enough to look around to appreciate art works, but if I get a chance, I definitely want to go there."
11318,189,0,40,INFJ,38,<no>  I've never had a hard time understanding other people's feelings. Because I didn't try to understand.
11319,189,0,40,INFJ,39,<no>  I've never been so good at planning my work every day. So it seems that I work spontaneously as time permits.
11320,189,0,40,INFJ,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. As I remember, when I was young, I was often alone at home every day, so there were many times when I was scared. That's why there are times when I'm anxious about things that don't even happen yet."
11321,189,0,40,INFJ,41,"<no>  I would rather talk on the phone than text. Because text messages are sometimes delayed, I tend to just call first and finish the business."
11322,189,0,40,INFJ,42,"<no>  I tend to respect other people's opinions. Rather than thinking that other people are wrong about what they think, I tend to just move on and say that my thoughts are different."
11323,189,0,40,INFJ,43,"<no>  My friend is the type to contact me asking to meet first, but not the type to contact me first. Because it's good to be alone, it's good to contact you to meet up, and it's good in any case."
11324,189,0,40,INFJ,44,"<no>  They are not inclined to get things done while making plans. When you improvise rather than plan, your plan doesn't seem to go wrong."
11325,189,0,40,INFJ,45,"<neutrality>  I used to regret my mistakes a lot, but not now. However, speaking from my past experience, I have regretted wasting time failing the civil service exam several times before."
11326,189,0,40,INFJ,46,"<no>  do a lot of research on human existence. I am exploring while wondering what the human root is, what kind of fruit that root wants to bear, and how to live to bear that fruit."
11327,189,0,40,INFJ,47,"<neutrality>  There are times when I get swept away by great emotions, but I tend to come to my senses right away and try to return to my original place. People around me have never evaluated or heard any evaluation about my emotions."
11328,189,0,40,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  Even when it wasn't my fault, I've reached out to a friend first. Saying that I am right and my friend is wrong is not right in itself, so I am just trying to keep my composure in mind."
11341,190,1,40,ESTP,1,"<Yes>  tend to make friends regularly. The reason is that I don't make friends regularly, but I think I'm making new friends because I get to meet new people because I do other sports or hobbies periodically."
11342,190,1,40,ESTP,2,"<Yes>  I devote my free time to various interests. The reason is that I started exercising for health these days, but I became more interested in taking golf or tennis lessons."
11343,190,1,40,ESTP,3,"<neutrality>  I cry when my partner cries. The reason is that the emotions of the crying person touches the heart, so it becomes sad like mine."
11344,190,1,40,ESTP,4,"<no>  I don't make preparations in advance. The reason is that if the chosen thing goes wrong, I tend to think that it was not mine, so I have no countermeasures and plan again."
11345,190,1,40,ESTP,5,"<no>  I'm not trying to be equanimous. The reason is that when the pressure of a bad situation arises, I try to express that the difficult is difficult and the difficult is difficult because I suffered panic symptoms after enduring it."
11346,190,1,40,ESTP,6,"<Yes>  I get along better with my acquaintances. The reason is that he is kind to those who approach him, but approaching him first is a bit awkward in terms of his personality. So I tend to talk more with people I know."
11347,190,1,40,ESTP,7,<Yes>  I finish or organize the most important projects first before moving on to other things. The reason is that doing many things at once can make you less focused and less anxious.
11348,190,1,40,ESTP,8,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason may or may not be emotional depending on the situation. I don't want to be too emotional, so I try hard."
11349,190,1,40,ESTP,9,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that I want to jot down important memories, but I don't like to be obsessed with taking notes."

11351,190,1,40,ESTP,11,"<no>  It's not easy for me to approach and talk first. The reason is that I am tolerant of those who approach me by nature, but I am a bit shy to approach them first. However, most of the time, the other person approached me, so after a while, we became friends."
11352,190,1,40,ESTP,12,"<neutrality>  don't like to debate a lot. The reason is that the opinions of others with different thoughts are very impressive, but most of them don't like to insist on their own opinions too much."
11353,190,1,40,ESTP,13,"<neutrality>  I try to follow reason. The reason is that I am a person with a lot of emotional aspects, and I try to live a neutral life."
11354,190,1,40,ESTP,14,"<Yes>  I like to be spontaneous. The reason is that it's comfortable and nice to meet friends, go on a trip, or rest depending on the situation or the mood at the time."
11355,190,1,40,ESTP,15,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is because I want to live as a good person, so I try not to show my bad side. But I don't want to fool myself too much. I think moderate maintenance is good."

11358,190,1,40,ESTP,18,<no>  I hate helping others succeed more than myself. The reason is that I feel more satisfied when I succeed and help others.
11359,190,1,40,ESTP,19,"<no>  have a lot of interests, but not all. The reason is that I like various things, but I think a life devoted to one field is more wonderful and good. I think it's better to know how to do one exercise properly."

11361,190,1,40,ESTP,21,"<Yes>  want to avoid the leader role. The reason is that I don't like incidents that happen because I have a different opinion from others, and I don't like stress when I try to do well because I have a strong sense of responsibility."
11362,190,1,40,ESTP,22,"<neutrality>  I think I have a bit of an artistic inclination. The reason is that my parents and younger brother have artistic talent, and people around me sometimes praise me."
11363,190,1,40,ESTP,23,"<neutrality>  I consider myself neutral. The reason is that in the world, the answer is not set like a mathematical formula, and both emotions and reason are considered important."
11364,190,1,40,ESTP,24,"<Yes>  I finish my chores before taking a break. The reason is that I hate procrastinating what I have to do, and I am happier when I rest after finishing my chores."
11365,190,1,40,ESTP,25,<no>  I hate watching the debate. The reason is that I don't like to see what happens in an argument and I like peaceful things. It's better to just acknowledge each other and share the same opinions.
11366,190,1,40,ESTP,26,"<no>  I tend to draw attention. It's because you enjoy it. If it's not loud and moral, it's my confidence that attracts attention, and I think it's good."
11367,190,1,40,ESTP,27,<neutrality>  I think emotions are neutral. The reason is to try to mediate according to the circumstances. Sometimes you need something fast and sometimes you need something slow.
11368,190,1,40,ESTP,28,<Yes>  get annoyed when I see people who are not effective. The reason is that it harms others.
11369,190,1,40,ESTP,29,"<no>  I don't procrastinate what I have to do. The reason is that the time I put off is not comfortable, and I have the personality of doing what I have to do first."
11370,190,1,40,ESTP,30,"<no> I'm not interested in questions about the afterlife. The reason is Christianity, so I believe that God and the country I believe in are fixed, so I think I should live faithfully in reality rather than interest."
11371,190,1,40,ESTP,31,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that when I was young, I liked being together unconditionally, but after becoming a housewife, I really like spending time alone."
11372,190,1,40,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  am not interested in theory-based discussions. The reason is that there are no correct answers in the world, and friends who have been content with reality often try to explain it theoretically."
11373,190,1,40,ESTP,33,"<Yes>  I am very empathetic to others. The reason is that all human beings live a similar life, so when I talk to someone from a different background than me, I feel the same way."
11374,190,1,40,ESTP,34,"<no>  I don't put off making decisions. The reason is that as time goes on, the answers get blurrier and the first answer is often the right one anyway."
11375,190,1,40,ESTP,35,"<Yes>  I don't regret the answer I've already decided on. The reason is that I think it's not my job to do something that shouldn't be done, and I quickly shake it off."
11376,190,1,40,ESTP,36,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that after spending time alone, I have a splendid time with people, and after spending time with acquaintances too often, I recharge my energy by having time alone again."
11377,190,1,40,ESTP,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. The reason is that there is a lot of art that moves you even if it is not necessarily an art museum, and it is not good to stand in line to see it in front of people."
11378,190,1,40,ESTP,38,"<no>  I don't have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. The reason is that they all experience similar things and there are very few similar situations, so you just have to understand their feelings."
11379,190,1,40,ESTP,39,"<neutrality>  am neutral. The reason is that sometimes you need a plan, but sometimes you don't want to live in a rut."
11380,190,1,40,ESTP,40,"<no>  I feel a lot of insecurity. The reason is that I'm scared, but after going through hard things as an adult, I get a panic attack, so even if I'm a little anxious, I feel anxious that the panic attack will come again."
11381,190,1,40,ESTP,41,<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that there are many people who want to communicate by listening to their voice rather than texting.
11382,190,1,40,ESTP,42,"<no>  I am not The reason is that I think it's good for each other to let other opinions flow as they are. We hurt each other with disagreeable opinions, and the hard process is tiring."
11383,190,1,40,ESTP,43,"<neutrality>  I consider myself neutral. The reason is that I accept and contact me at any time, whether the other person needs it or I need it."
11384,190,1,40,ESTP,44,"<Yes>  I am. The reason is that if there is a setback, it is not resolved, so whether it is a good result or not, find another way. It has a lot to do with sports, lessons, travel, etc."
11385,190,1,40,ESTP,45,"<Yes>  I often regret my mistakes. The reason is because it often appears in dreams. You may dream about relationships or the opposite sex, or you may fall into thoughts before going to bed."
11386,190,1,40,ESTP,46,"<Yes>  I don't think deeply. The reason is that Christianity is a big reason, and it is a world where humans cannot live only according to their will."
11387,190,1,40,ESTP,47,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. I think the reason is that we interpret personal problems and public problems differently, such as marital quarrels or family and friends. People around me sometimes say that I am emotional."
11388,190,1,40,ESTP,48,<Yes> I'm trying The reason is that I can make the same mistakes and that all people are not perfect.
11401,191,1,20,ENTJ,1,"<Yes>  When I go to the same small group, go to an academy, or work part-time, I quickly become close to share information with people. However, if the opportunity to meet decreases, we naturally drift away."
11402,191,1,20,ENTJ,2,"<Yes> Since I was young, I had a wide range of interests, so I tended to participate diligently in this and that. These days, I am interested in brain science and psychology, studying philosophy, sewing, embroidery, tarot cards, and digital drawing."
11403,191,1,20,ENTJ,3,"<neutrality>  When things I've been through or situations I can understand, I tend to shed tears without even realizing it. But most of the time, no matter how hard you try to squeeze the tears out, they just don't come out."
11404,191,1,20,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  tend to have a lot of anxiety when things go wrong. So even if it takes a little time in advance, it's easy to plan and work at least 3-5 contingency plans."
11405,191,1,20,ENTJ,5,"<neutrality>  Because I have experienced anxiety or stress in the past, I have recently been trying to keep my composure through mind control, meditation, and writing a gratitude journal. There are times when it is difficult, but I feel that I am not affected by the environment more and more."
11406,191,1,20,ENTJ,6,"<no>  When I first meet someone, I value first impressions and am careful, so I tend to talk to people I already know and get introduced to them by acquaintances."
11407,191,1,20,ENTJ,7,"<no> As much as I have many interests, I tend to run several projects at once. It's hard to do one thing at a time because when you suddenly lose interest, your concentration drops significantly. Recently, along with a project to personally study and create Korean traditional patterns, I am doing a tarot card illustration drawing project and a doll clothes design project all at once."
11408,191,1,20,ENTJ,8,"<neutrality> After watching an interesting movie, novel, poem, or play, I tend to fall in love with it, thinking about what might have happened next. And I tend to share my impressions anonymously online or by talking to friends. However, such impressions do not last more than a day or two."
11409,191,1,20,ENTJ,9,"<Yes> Planning is like life to me. Because the stress of forgetting an appointment or not completing a task within a time limit is severe. So, I tend to use a lot of planning tools such as post-it memos and diaries as well as schedules, alarms, reminders, and notions on my smartphone."
11410,191,1,20,ENTJ,10,"<Yes>  prided myself on being perfect, but I don't get stressed out a lot if I get a little pointed out, but I tend to think over and over again in my head what went wrong and what to do next. Recently, I thought about why my memory keeps blurring about work that I had forgotten for a while, and I thought that I should write it down as soon as something happens in the future."
11411,191,1,20,ENTJ,11,"<neutrality> On the street, I don't tend to try to have a conversation because I get a lot of misunderstandings these days. However, when I share the same hobbies or work to some extent, or when I am older or have a position, I tend to approach first in meetings or workplaces. I usually approached them first at my hobby class or at my former job, asked them questions, and shared their hardships together to become closer."
11412,191,1,20,ENTJ,12,"<neutrality>  love reading people's different interpretations of a work of art and accepting what is acceptable. However, I don't want to participate in debating whether this is right or that is right with people, and I think it's a waste of time."
11413,191,1,20,ENTJ,13,"<neutrality>  I myself think that it is better to follow the emotion or reason in the situation in the light of previous experience and then decide what is appropriate first. However, people around me often say that I am like a robot because I am cold-hearted and cold."
11414,191,1,20,ENTJ,14,"<no>  It's rather stressful to miss what you absolutely have to do because you want to do it spontaneously, and because you want to do it most efficiently, you plan your schedule by the hour the night before or the morning at the latest."
11415,191,1,20,ENTJ,15,"<neutrality>  Basically, I tend to do what I want to do no matter what other people think. It's because there are so many things I regret because I gave up while watching others notice when I was young. However, if I am judged to be someone I am interested in or someone I will see often in the future, I tend to pay a lot of attention to how I look in their eyes."
11416,191,1,20,ENTJ,16,"<Yes>  I don't know if it's because I've been working from home more often due to the corona virus or because I see a lot of small groups around me in areas I'm interested in, but I'm struggling to participate in activities with others when I have time."
11417,191,1,20,ENTJ,17,"<Yes>  I enjoy to some extent appreciating works of art such as movies, novels, poems, and plays. That's why I don't get frustrated with open endings, and I like to compare my own views with people's various views. Recently, I enjoyed watching films like Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water directed by Guillermo del Toro."
11418,191,1,20,ENTJ,18,"<no>  Basically, I believe that it is more valuable to invest in myself than in others, so I do not participate in helping others succeed unless it is absolutely necessary."
11419,191,1,20,ENTJ,19,"<no>  have a lot of interests, but since planning is ingrained in my body, I always plan what I have to do next. Recently, interests such as learning sewing, practicing embroidery, and digital drawing are allotted to the most efficient time slot, and whenever there is a setback due to other schedules, I make amends and supplements."
11420,191,1,20,ENTJ,20,"<Yes>  I like to make plans, and I think the reason I do it well is because of my worry and anxiety about things going wrong. Therefore, I often worry that things might go wrong."
11421,191,1,20,ENTJ,21,"<no>  Of course, I know that having a leader or position in a group is often difficult, but I like taking on the leadership role myself because it is rewarding and suits my aptitude."
11422,191,1,20,ENTJ,22,"<neutrality> I'm not a natural artist, but I think I am to some extent. Recently, there have been times when I thought I wanted to write a novel or draw a picture, but no matter how much I thought about it, inspiration never came to my mind. However, that doesn't mean I'm giving up on everything, and I don't think there's a lack of artistic inclination because people around me say, 'Your own world is solid'."
11423,191,1,20,ENTJ,23,"<no> There are situations in the world where emotions should be considered more, but I think there are situations where reason should be considered more. Therefore, it is not that people value reason over emotion, but that it contributes to a better world by considering both emotion and reason at the same time."
11424,191,1,20,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  When I take a break without finishing my housework or chores, I keep reminding myself of the remaining work, so I don't feel like taking a break even when I'm resting. So, I always finish my chores and take a break."
11425,191,1,20,ENTJ,25,"<no>  I myself don't enjoy arguing unless it's absolutely necessary, and I don't like arguing because I think it's unnecessary and a waste of time due to our inability to understand each other."
11426,191,1,20,ENTJ,26,"<no>  don't think I'm getting attention myself, but I've recently noticed that I've been subconsciously garnering people's attention. For example, I tend to draw people's attention by always raising my hand to ask a question when no one has a question in a lecture or telling a light and funny story when people are quiet at a meeting."
11427,191,1,20,ENTJ,27,"<neutrality>  I'm trying to keep my composure, so the frequency has decreased a lot lately, but when I hear news of an artist I support or receive good news, such as winning an event, my bad mood quickly improves."
11428,191,1,20,ENTJ,28,<Yes>  I like to plan with efficiency in mind when it comes to planning. That's why it's very frustrating to see people who move without efficiency. It is very frustrating to see my sister or mother scrambling for a long time doing something that they can do in one sitting.
11429,191,1,20,ENTJ,29,"<no>  tend to do it when I plan, except when it's most efficient to do it last. Even lately, other than my health issues, I've taken care of what I need to do right away."
11430,191,1,20,ENTJ,30,"<neutrality>  Basically, I'm not interested in the afterlife. Rather, I think it is more valuable to be faithful to the present. However, when I watch books, movies, or dramas that deal with questions or perspectives about the afterlife, I tend to watch them with interest."
11431,191,1,20,ENTJ,31,"<Yes>  These days, I'm alone for a long time, so it's very difficult if no one else is with me. Unless your health is particularly bad or you have a lot to do, I think being with others is good for your mental health and makes you happy."
11432,191,1,20,ENTJ,32,"<no> There is obviously an important point in theory or principle. I don't think so because I think both theory and practice should be considered important. For example, in the field of early childhood education, which is my major, I think that not only the work practice of kindergarten teachers but also theories of early childhood education and teaching theory should be considered as important."
11433,191,1,20,ENTJ,33,"<Yes>  have enough empathy for those around me as well as for myself. I think it's because I've experienced various books and people. So I think it's easy for someone from a completely different background than me to relate to. It's easy to sympathize with people who work in science and engineering, a field completely different from mine, or people who grow up in open or closed families, if you think about it from their point of view."
11434,191,1,20,ENTJ,34,"<Yes>  think you have to be very careful when making decisions. So, before the deadline, we ask a lot of questions, consider various situations, and make a careful decision until the end."
11435,191,1,20,ENTJ,35,"<Yes>  I don't think twice about the decisions I've already made because I've made them carefully over a long period of time. Also, I'm going to carry out the decision I've already made because I think doing that is believing in myself."
11436,191,1,20,ENTJ,36,"<Yes>  It's easy to become depressed and depressed when I'm alone, so when I have time, I try to attend offline events with my friends, and if it's difficult, I tend to join online meetings with people."
11437,191,1,20,ENTJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't think going to art galleries or appreciating works of art are my hobbies. However, I always go to appreciate art works of artists or fields that I am interested in."
11438,191,1,20,ENTJ,38,"<no> It's often frustrating to be realistic about other people's feelings, but it's not hard to understand other people's feelings. Listening to that person's story and imagining that I am that person, in most cases, of course I feel worthy of it. When I actually talk with my friends, it is frustrating to see my boyfriend fighting over trivial matters and suffering, but I can definitely understand and empathize with my friend's feelings."
11439,191,1,20,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  I'm rather the anxious type if I don't have a plan. So, I like to wake up late in the morning and plan what to do."
11440,191,1,20,ENTJ,40,"<no>  I start to feel insecure when things go 30% off from perfect. So the plan was exhausted in the body. Rather than an innate tendency, I think I learned from watching my mother's tendency as I grew up."
11441,191,1,20,ENTJ,41,"<no> I've recently come to feel that a phone call is the quickest and surest way to resolve a problem. Therefore, I tend not to avoid it unless it is difficult for the other person to talk on the phone or it is too late at night."
11442,191,1,20,ENTJ,42,"<no>  It doesn't take me long to understand opinions that are very different from mine. Rather, I tend to think, ¡°It could be.¡± When I see opinions different from mine on anonymous forums, I often realize that I might think this way."
11443,191,1,20,ENTJ,43,"<Yes>  My friends don't tend to contact me first, so I think I'll contact them first."
11444,191,1,20,ENTJ,44,"<Yes> If there is a setback in my plan, I tend to come up with a contingency plan and another contingency plan rather than improvising. Recently, when a hard-planned schedule for the day was canceled due to someone else's circumstances, I did something (read a book or listen to a lecture) that I had planned to do at that time."
11445,191,1,20,ENTJ,45,"<no>  It was a long time ago, and I think it is more valuable to be faithful to reality. I am also grateful for the fact that I was able to learn from my old mistakes, and I respect those mistakes because they were my own choices."
11446,191,1,20,ENTJ,46,"<no>  I believe that all beings in the world will definitely have value. That's why I like philosophy, and I often think deeply about the reason for human existence and life."
11447,191,1,20,ENTJ,47,"<neutrality>  In general, I tend to control my emotions well, but I think there are many things that my concentration depends on my emotions. People around me say that I am calm and calm even when an incident occurs."
11448,191,1,20,ENTJ,48,"<Yes>  I think it is right to tell the other person what they did wrong not for the purpose of punishing them when they do something wrong, but in the belief that it would be nice for the other person to grow further. Therefore, I always try to talk back and praise the strengths together so that the other person does not feel discouraged even when he knows his mistakes."
11461,192,0,40,ISTJ,1,"<no>  don't make new friends regularly. The reason is that I don't like going to new gatherings or places like that, and I get a little wary when I meet new people."
11462,192,0,40,ISTJ,2,"<Yes>  I spend quite a bit of my free time. The reason is that I am curious about things other than the field I am interested in, so I spend my time. I am interested in real estate investing."
11463,192,0,40,ISTJ,3,"<Yes>  There are many times when I want to cry with you. The reason is not like someone else's business, but because it's my story, so I feel sad together."
11464,192,0,40,ISTJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to make preparations. The reason is to prepare for the case that does not work, and the mind is relieved."
11465,192,0,40,ISTJ,5,<neutrality>  I'm a little different from time to time. The reason is that I tend to be nervous when I announce something.
11466,192,0,40,ISTJ,6,<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I already know. The reason is that it is not easy to find something to talk about with a new person.
11467,192,0,40,ISTJ,7,"<Yes>  tend to start another project after completing one. The reason is that I can't do many things at once. Also, the performance was not good."
11468,192,0,40,ISTJ,8,<no>  I am rational The reason must be logical and reasonable to accept or sympathize.
11469,192,0,40,ISTJ,9,"<neutrality>  I like to make plans sometimes. The reason is that I like to make plans for work, etc., but I don't enjoy using a diary."
11470,192,0,40,ISTJ,10,"<no> Mistakes can happen at any time, so I don't care too much and try not to make the same mistake."
11471,192,0,40,ISTJ,11,"<neutrality>  It seems neither easy nor difficult. At first, the conversation goes well, but it is not easy to find the topic of conversation."
11472,192,0,40,ISTJ,12,<no>  I am not interested in debating. The reason is that I am not good at presenting and I am not good at refutating logically.
11473,192,0,40,ISTJ,13,"<Yes>  tend to follow reason. Even when I think about it, I tend to have a lot of thoughts, I tend to think about whether it is logical, and the evaluations of people around me are similar."
11474,192,0,40,ISTJ,14,"<no>  I tend to plan. Even when you go on a trip, plan your lodging and travel route."
11475,192,0,40,ISTJ,15,"<no>  I tend to worry. The reason is that when you decide to do something, you gradually look at the thoughts and opinions of the people around you."
11476,192,0,40,ISTJ,16,"<no> When I was a new employee, I enjoyed participating, but these days, I tend to be annoyed with group activities and do only necessary activities."
11477,192,0,40,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I don't like movies or books. I don't like it, so I just like the work that I recently liked to relieve stress."
11478,192,0,40,ISTJ,18,<no>  I get great satisfaction from what I do. The reason is that I am more rewarded because I have achieved success through planning and practicing myself.
11479,192,0,40,ISTJ,19,"<Yes>  Sometimes you just don't know what to do. I am also interested in financial technology, and there are too many interests such as real estate, money, and children's education."
11480,192,0,40,ISTJ,20,<neutrality>  I am often worried. Too much worry seems to ruin work and it seems that worries have a negative effect on the people around you.
11481,192,0,40,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  don't like leaders very much. The reason is that I tend to be conscious of other people, and it is not easy to gather people's thoughts and make decisions."
11482,192,0,40,ISTJ,22,<Yes>  i don't think there is The reason is that I don't know what is more beautiful when I make something or when I choose something like an interior.
11483,192,0,40,ISTJ,23,<no>  I think that there must be various people and their diverse thoughts will make the world a better place while complementing each other.
11484,192,0,40,ISTJ,24,"<Yes>  I want to finish the housework first. It's hard to do it again after taking a break, so I like the feeling of finishing it first and resting."
11485,192,0,40,ISTJ,25,"<neutrality>  I don't think it's good or enjoyable to argue or watch. The reason is that when we say bad things about each other, we often say reasons we don't understand."
11486,192,0,40,ISTJ,26,"<Yes>  don't tend to draw attention. The reason is that he wears modest clothes, doesn't talk loudly, and doesn't stand out."
11487,192,0,40,ISTJ,27,"<no>  does not change quickly He's not the type to get angry on a regular basis, and he doesn't suddenly feel heartbroken."
11488,192,0,40,ISTJ,28,"<Yes>  It's not annoying, but it's a bit frustrating. It is frustrating to see people who neither plan nor give detailed information about their work."
11489,192,0,40,ISTJ,29,"<Yes>  tend to put it off until the end. Even lately, there are things that I have been putting off until the last thing I have planned to complete."
11490,192,0,40,ISTJ,30,"<neutrality>  I'm not interested, but I'm curious and interested. The reason is that I am curious about the afterlife because it is something that some people have experienced, and I am interested to some extent because I also die."
11491,192,0,40,ISTJ,31,"<no>  I like to be alone. Even these days, I like to have time alone and listen to music and relax."
11492,192,0,40,ISTJ,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested. The reason is that such discussions are too boring and time consuming, so I don't watch them."
11493,192,0,40,ISTJ,33,"<Yes>  I am good at empathizing. People who do production work live in a completely different background than me, so they talk harshly, but when we talk, I feel that they are not very different."
11494,192,0,40,ISTJ,34,"<Yes>  tend to put it off until the end. Even lately, there are things that I have been putting off until the last thing I have planned to complete."
11495,192,0,40,ISTJ,35,<Yes>  tend not to think again. The reason is because I felt that not much would change even if I changed the decision again.
11496,192,0,40,ISTJ,36,"<no>  I tend to spend time alone. Even these days, fun parties seem to be stressful, and I enjoy spending time alone."
11497,192,0,40,ISTJ,37,"<no>  I don't like art. The reason is that even after listening to the explanation, I don't know what the content is."
11498,192,0,40,ISTJ,38,<neutrality>  It seems to be different depending on the situation. The case where there was a difficult time is when you suddenly start a conversation with anger.
11499,192,0,40,ISTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan. Even when you go on a trip, plan your lodging and travel route."
11500,192,0,40,ISTJ,40,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different for each situation, but it seems that there are times when I feel anxious. Anxiety is a bit of anxiety when you think about various things to think about, worry about, and the future."
11501,192,0,40,ISTJ,41,<Yes>  I want to avoid talking on the phone. The reason is that there will always be unforeseen problems.
11502,192,0,40,ISTJ,42,"<no>  don't spend a lot of time I try to talk a lot and try to understand, but I don't spend a lot of time. I couldn't understand even though we had a lot of conversations recently."
11503,192,0,40,ISTJ,43,"<no>  I'm not the first to contact you. Even now, rather than asking to meet first, I tend to meet by invitation or by contact."
11504,192,0,40,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback to the plan, try to get back to it as quickly as possible. Recently, something went wrong, but I summoned people to get back quickly and came up with a solution."
11505,192,0,40,ISTJ,45,"<neutrality>  It seems that there are often times when I regret it. These days, even if I make a mistake, I have the will not to do it again rather than regret it."
11506,192,0,40,ISTJ,46,<Yes>  tend not to think. The reason is that the content about it is so profound that it is boring and uninteresting.
11507,192,0,40,ISTJ,47,"<no>  I am not swayed by emotions. Even if I think about it, when such a situation comes, I try to find my cool, so I am not swayed by emotions, and people around me tend to evaluate it that way."
11508,192,0,40,ISTJ,48,"<Yes> Even if I do something wrong, I tend to do my best to save face unless I do it intentionally. The reason is that if I don't do that and just criticize, there is a high possibility that the boomerang will come back to me."
11521,193,0,40,INTJ,1,"<no>  I don't have an easygoing personality when it comes to meeting new friends, and as I get older, I find it annoying."
11522,193,0,40,INTJ,2,"<Yes>  Originally, I have a lot of curiosity, so I tend to find out and learn about people's interests. These days, I am interested in the causes and damages of climate change."
11523,193,0,40,INTJ,3,"<Yes>  If you cry together, depending on the other person's situation, you will remember the situation you had before and feel sad."
11524,193,0,40,INTJ,4,"<Yes>  Since I am the type of person who tries to complete a task or plan perfectly at once, I tend to prepare several countermeasures in case of an emergency before proceeding."
11525,193,0,40,INTJ,5,"<Yes> Recently, while taking a walk along the Yangjaecheon road, a ferocious dog barked at me, but as I saw on TV, I calmly escaped the situation by walking slowly backwards without showing my back."
11526,193,0,40,INTJ,6,"<no>  It's not a situation where I go to parties or events often, so even if I go occasionally, I want to talk comfortably with familiar people rather than having awkward conversations with strangers."
11527,193,0,40,INTJ,7,"<neutrality>  It will depend on the situation, but there are times when a project in progress is long or in a situation where it is cut off in the middle."
11528,193,0,40,INTJ,8,"<Yes>  I often cry while watching movies or dramas. Seeing that my wife who is watching with me said that she was not in a situation to cry at all, it seems that I am very sentimental."
11529,193,0,40,INTJ,9,"<no>  I make a plan, but I do not make a list, much less use a diary or electronic tool, I just make a whole plan in my head."
11530,193,0,40,INTJ,10,"<Yes>  I consider myself to be quite knowledgeable. A few days ago, I misunderstood the quiz from Youngchul Kim's Power FM and doubted my knowledge."
11531,193,0,40,INTJ,11,"<no>  It's not easy to approach strangers, so it's not easy even if you're interested. When I was in school, I couldn't even talk to a girl I thought was pretty, and even if there was a celebrity I was interested in, I couldn't ask for an autograph."
11532,193,0,40,INTJ,12,"<Yes>  I am not interested in the art itself, so I am not interested in how the work is interpreted."
11533,193,0,40,INTJ,13,"<Yes>  I think I'm very rational in real life. I was in charge of a branch manager at a small and medium-sized business I used to work for, and rumors spread that I was the FM manager."
11534,193,0,40,INTJ,14,"<neutrality>  I tend to make plans for public things related to the company, but I tend to improvise private things like day trips or watching movies."
11535,193,0,40,INTJ,15,"<neutrality>  I don't care about people I've known for a long time, but I do care a little about people I'm meeting for the first time. This is because I think the first impression you give to the other person is quite important in what kind of relationship you will have with that person in the future."
11536,193,0,40,INTJ,16,"<neutrality>  I don't enjoy it, but when invited, I don't refuse and participate. Recently, events such as alumni gatherings did not last long due to the impact of Corona."
11537,193,0,40,INTJ,17,"<no>  Whether it's a book or a drama, I like things with a definite ending. I hate movies with open endings because I feel like I went to the bathroom to work and didn't clean up."
11538,193,0,40,INTJ,18,"<Yes>  Just as successful monarchs have great servants, I believe that when the person I helped succeeds, I have played a large part in their success."
11539,193,0,40,INTJ,19,"<Yes>  wanted to be good at English, so I was studying English on my own, but this year, I became interested in cultivating the field, so I can't concentrate on either planting vegetables or studying English."
11540,193,0,40,INTJ,20,"<no>  I'm not the type to worry before doing anything. If worrying will solve it, what are you worried about?"
11541,193,0,40,INTJ,21,"<neutrality>  If there is another person who is suitable as a leader in the organization, I do not want to be involved. Because I don't want to be under the stress I feel as a leader."
11542,193,0,40,INTJ,22,"<Yes>  I don't agree with them at all about the subject matter of expensive paintings or works of art, and I wonder why they are priced so high."
11543,193,0,40,INTJ,23,"<neutrality>  I don't think there are many. Just as the world does not revolve only by rules or laws, I believe that a world in which reason and sensibility are well harmonized is a better world."
11544,193,0,40,INTJ,24,"<Yes> Taking a break will make you feel more comfortable when you have finished all of your daily tasks, such as cleaning or washing the dishes."
11545,193,0,40,INTJ,25,"<Yes>  I don't think there is a right answer for everything. However, depending on which side comes up with more accurate facts and reasons in the course of the debate, I tend to pay more attention to the course of the debate due to the additional tilt of the debate."
11546,193,0,40,INTJ,26,"<Yes>  think it's good to live without needing to draw others' attention and not needing to be conscious. I don't even do things like Instagram or Facebook, which a lot of people do."
11547,193,0,40,INTJ,27,"<no>  I have a calm personality, so I don't change or change quickly. You can respond calmly even if another car cuts in or drives recklessly while driving."
11548,193,0,40,INTJ,28,"<Yes> When I see people who are worse than me, I often wonder why they can't be that good. My wife is really bad at knives, so when I cut potatoes or vegetables, I cut them all."
11549,193,0,40,INTJ,29,"<no>  Unless there is a special reason, I don't put off what I've been doing until later. Even if it's a little over the work hour, I finish all the work I was doing and go home."
11550,193,0,40,INTJ,30,<Yes>  I am very curious about the afterlife. I think it's because the afterlife is a part that no one in the world has ever experienced.
11551,193,0,40,INTJ,31,"<no>  When I take a break, I want to be alone. Especially on weekends when I'm at home, I love watching my favorite sport alone and having a beer."
11552,193,0,40,INTJ,32,"<Yes>  Even if you have such a discussion, there is no fixed answer, so I am not interested in having a direct discussion. It's as if nothing would change no matter if the chicken came first or the egg came first."
11553,193,0,40,INTJ,33,"<neutrality>  I agree with some of them, but there are many that I don't. My nephew is approaching 30, but he doesn't get a job and only plays games at home. I don't understand why he lives like that."
11554,193,0,40,INTJ,34,"<no>  I tend to make decisions very decisively. Even if the decision is wrong, once I proceed and fail, I tend to try again."
11555,193,0,40,INTJ,35,"<Yes>  For decisions I have already made, I tend to wait for the outcome. You can only tell by looking at the results whether a decision is right or wrong."
11556,193,0,40,INTJ,36,"<no>  Rather than parties or events, I prefer to be alone and relax. On the weekends, it's good to watch a sporting event or watch a movie alone."
11557,193,0,40,INTJ,37,<no>  have never been to an art museum since I was born. I don't even want to go. This is a person very far from art like fine art.
11558,193,0,40,INTJ,38,"<neutrality>  I understand most people's feelings, but sometimes I don't. Among my acquaintances, there is a person who often suffers from violence from her husband, but she says that she lives through it because of the children, but I don't know why I have to endure it because of the children."
11559,193,0,40,INTJ,39,"<neutrality>  In the business field, mistakes lead to financial losses, so I tend to make plans, but in personal matters, I often think that it is just a daily routine and do not plan separately."
11560,193,0,40,INTJ,40,"<neutrality> There are times when I am anxious about old age. It's not about economics, but since my husband and I don't have children, we're getting old and sick, and if one of the couple dies first, I'm a little anxious about how the other one will fare."
11561,193,0,40,INTJ,41,"<neutrality>  I don't avoid phone calls, but neither do I prefer long, meaningless calls. I tend to make short, concise calls only when necessary."
11562,193,0,40,INTJ,42,"<no> As all roads lead to Rome, there is no right answer in the world, so we do not necessarily try to understand other people's opinions. I just think this person thinks this way too."
11563,193,0,40,INTJ,43,"<no>  I prefer to work and rest alone, so I'm not the type to call a friend first and ask to meet, but I'm the type of person who never refuses a request."
11564,193,0,40,INTJ,44,"<neutrality>  If the original plan goes wrong, I tend to go ahead with the plan and make up for the wrong parts. To give a simple example, if you go to the mart to buy something and you forget your wallet or card, instead of going back home, buy something at the mart and make a bank transfer or think of another method."
11565,193,0,40,INTJ,45,"<Yes> When I was in school, I often regret why I didn't get courage when I was suffering from school violence. Recently, I bought it to buy high-quality stocks, but the thing that I regret the most is that they were delisted."
11566,193,0,40,INTJ,46,<Yes>  I have never thought deeply about the philosophical aspects of the existence and reason of life. I think life is a success if you live happily without hearing bad things from others and not being sad.
11567,193,0,40,INTJ,47,<no>  think I'm good at controlling my emotions. Most of the people around me also say that I am cool-headed.
11568,193,0,40,INTJ,48,"<no>  If a fault or mistake is clearly revealed to be the other person's, I tend to point it out. That way, I think I won't make the same mistake next time."
11581,194,1,20,ENTP,1,"<Yes>  don't like awkwardness, so I tend to approach people well. If there is a newly given environment, there are times when new friends are made to fit into it, and new friends may be made in the process of maintaining the current environment, so it seems that new friends are made periodically."
11582,194,1,20,ENTP,2,"<Yes> My current interest is pets. I want my current puppy to eat even a little bit of good food, and I want to do everything that others do, so I research and analyze even one more before purchasing dog supplies or food."
11583,194,1,20,ENTP,3,"<neutrality>  I think the degree of emotional transfer depends on the relationship with the other person. If it's close, I think I'll want to cry because I feel so good, but if I'm not very close, I don't think there's much reaction, wondering why."
11584,194,1,20,ENTP,4,"<Yes>  I always have a contingency plan in place. When I buy things, I often buy them for the future, and even if it's not raining, I always carry a small umbrella in my bag. Because human life can happen unexpectedly, I think it is good to prepare for the future when you are alert or when you have time to spare."
11585,194,1,20,ENTP,5,"<no>  I tend to have more heart pounding in high-pressure environments. There was a piece that had to be completed on time, but the deadline was approaching and there was still a lot of work to be done. When people around me informed me that the deadline was approaching, my hands started to tremble and my heart raced as if I could hear it right next to my ears."
11586,194,1,20,ENTP,6,"<Yes>  In any meeting, I think you should say hello to someone you know first. It's important to meet new people, but I think it's not too late to meet new people after making eye contact with people who have already entered my boundaries."
11587,194,1,20,ENTP,7,"<no> When I work on one project, I sometimes get bored or distracted by other interests. That's why we often work on several projects at the same time. If you get stuck or get bored while working on one project, if you put that project on hold and proceed with another project, the flow may be interrupted, but you can avoid wasting time and increase work efficiency."
11588,194,1,20,ENTP,8,"<Yes>  like to look at the sky. When your heart is stuffy, looking up at the sky and taking a deep breath will make you smile for no reason and feel at ease. In such an ideal reality, I think that sometimes doing sentimental actions is good and helpful to relieve accumulated stress."
11589,194,1,20,ENTP,9,"<no>  don't like making plans. Even if you make a plan, you can not keep it, and when you make a plan, you are often chased by time and cannot complete the work you want to do. I tried to write a diary when I was a student, but I always couldn't make it past March, and I even wrote a week's worth in one day."
11590,194,1,20,ENTP,10,"<no>  don't doubt my abilities just because I made a small mistake. Because everyone can make mistakes. Recently, in my memory, it was true that B was necessary to become A, so I argued that it was right for the other person, but there was a time when I needed C, not B. It may seem that B is necessary, but it was a situation where C, not B, should be used, so I quickly agreed and accepted it."
11591,194,1,20,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  don't find it difficult to talk to others. Because there are so many different elements to talk about, such as really everyday elements like the weather or special elements like the work environment, you can use the right elements to start a conversation depending on the person you meet for the first time and in what environment. When I talked to a new employee who had just joined the company for the first time, what was the environment like and what kind of welfare benefits were there, the employee immediately opened up to me and approached me."
11592,194,1,20,ENTP,12,"<no>  love looking at works of art. This is because a work of art may have the creator's intention, but it can also be interpreted by the viewer's different perspectives. I don't think there is a right answer for interpreting a work of art because even families who grew up in a similar environment can have different perspectives on interpreting a work of art. That's why I think I can broaden my horizons even more if I know that my thoughts are like this and your thoughts are like this."
11593,194,1,20,ENTP,13,"<Yes>  tend to value rationality a little more. Because when you get caught up in your emotions, you can't see the reality right in front of your eyes, which can lead to incorrect results. There are of course situations where emotions should come first, but I think you can make a more sober decision if you follow reason first. The evaluation of the surroundings is also the same. No matter how close a friend is, it often plays the role of a friend who helps you wake up to reality in a cool way."
11594,194,1,20,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  like to make decisions on the fly. Even if you have planned a schedule for the day, you may not be able to keep that schedule depending on your surroundings. When I went on a trip, there was a case where the restaurant I wanted to go to was not open, but on the way to that restaurant, there was a time when I turned to the restaurant where there were many people I saw. It's good to do what you planned, but if you follow the plan too much, you won't be able to enjoy the things around you that you can actually enjoy."
11595,194,1,20,ENTP,15,"<no>  I don't really care about other people's opinions. There were times when I cared about other people's opinions, but they weren't very helpful to me. That's why I can't say I don't care about the opinions of people around me, but I tend to go in the direction I want to be with my own stubbornness."
11596,194,1,20,ENTP,16,"<no>  These days, I don't participate in many group activities. When I was in school, group activities were natural, but now there are many things that require my own time. If a group activity is necessary, of course, I would participate, but these days, I don't seem to find it and participate in group activities."
11597,194,1,20,ENTP,17,"<no>  I like works with a clear ending. There are many works I have enjoyed recently, but there is no work that I think has a clear ending. I also like being spoiled for the ending. Rather than an ending that is too open, I like to wrap up what happened in the work."
11598,194,1,20,ENTP,18,"<no>  I used to love helping others succeed. Naturally, I supported him and rejoiced with his success. But these days, those people really did well because they were good at it, and my sincere cheering didn't help at all."
11599,194,1,20,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  have a variety of interests. Because there are so many things I want to do. So it seems that they are not satisfied with one thing and get tired quickly. Even if you watch a movie through Netflix, you do shopping for your pet, or suddenly turn on your computer to organize your thoughts. With that said, you might think you've just decided what to do next, but it's not. Even if you watch a movie, you go through the process of looking for another movie and suddenly find a shopping app for pets while thinking about what to do. Rather than really deciding what to do next, it seems that there are many actions that happen by chance."
11600,194,1,20,ENTP,20,"<Yes>  I have a lot of worries. The more confidently I prepare for something, the more I worry about things going wrong. I really thought it was the right answer, but if it's not the right answer, I get really frustrated. When that happens, the mentality really goes out and I don't think about anything."
11601,194,1,20,ENTP,21,"<no>  like to assume a leadership role. Ever since I was young, I have always had the experience of leading someone, and I love the process of bringing people together."
11602,194,1,20,ENTP,22,"<no>  I think it's artistic. This is because I like to go to art galleries, look at art pieces, make my own interpretations, and imagine how I would have expressed them."
11603,194,1,20,ENTP,23,"<Yes>  think there are rational things that I couldn't do because I was obscured by my emotions. That's why I think that if people were rational people, they would have been able to look at the reality that people were swept away by emotions and could have developed further."
11604,194,1,20,ENTP,24,<Yes>  I think you should finish the housework first. It's because I think it's good to rest after doing all the things that need to be done comfortably.
11605,194,1,20,ENTP,25,"<Yes>  enjoy seeing other people's arguments. It is because through the arguments of others, you can know their thoughts that are different from yours, and you can look at the world from various perspectives."
11606,194,1,20,ENTP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. When you need attention, you enjoy receiving it, but you don't bother trying to get attention. It's because there are not many good things that have happened if I have been able to take a look at it."
11607,194,1,20,ENTP,27,"<Yes>  My emotions change quickly. To put it simply, even if I'm in a bad mood, I feel better right away when I see the puppy I'm raising, or I feel bad right away when I meet someone I don't like while playing happily with friends."
11608,194,1,20,ENTP,28,"<Yes>  I hate inefficient people. I feel frustrated when I see someone who creates an inefficient situation even though it is obvious how to do things efficiently. If there is someone who causes inefficient operation during team play, I tend to tell my opinion honestly and find the most efficient way."
11609,194,1,20,ENTP,29,<Yes>  I tend to do things at the end. Their high moment-to-moment focus helps them achieve faster and better results when deadlines approach.
11610,194,1,20,ENTP,30,"<no>  I'm not really interested in the afterlife. In fact, it is because it is thought that the rites and rites held by real people for the deceased are also performed by the living for self-satisfaction."
11611,194,1,20,ENTP,31,"<neutrality>  I like both crowded and single environments. It's because if you come from a crowded environment, you need time to be alone, and if you have time to be alone, you want to be with many people again."
11612,194,1,20,ENTP,32,"<no>  like theory. When I learn something, I like to talk about it with others. It's fun to know what each other thinks, and it's because you can learn a little more about the theory you learned through that process."
11613,194,1,20,ENTP,33,"<Yes>  think all people are different. Even conflicts of opinion with family members who can be seen as raised in the same environment can occur, because it is so natural to have different opinions with people who grew up in a different environment. That is why I believe that if we acknowledge the differences of each other, we can empathize with them."
11614,194,1,20,ENTP,34,"<no>  tend to make decisions as quickly as possible. Because there are many times when quick decisions can lead to quick results. Also, even when the outcome is wrong, a quick decision gives you the opportunity to make a different decision and reach a different outcome."
11615,194,1,20,ENTP,35,<Yes>  I tend not to change my mind until I reach the conclusion that a decision I have already made is really wrong. This is because you can draw the most appropriate conclusion by going straight down a single path with one decision.
11616,194,1,20,ENTP,36,"<no>  I tend to relieve fatigue through time alone. When I hang out with a lot of people, I need time alone, and I tend to recover my condition through that time."
11617,194,1,20,ENTP,37,"<Yes>  I like to analyze works of art. I like to analyze the artist's intentions in the work, and I like the feeling of being at ease when I go to an art museum."
11618,194,1,20,ENTP,38,<Yes>  I sometimes find it difficult to understand the feelings of people who are not my own. There are times when you can't relate to your feelings and you wonder why that person is doing that.
11619,194,1,20,ENTP,39,"<no>  I'm not good at planning and I don't like it. I set out what I must do, but I am not good at planning what to do from what time to what time, and I am not good at sticking to it."
11620,194,1,20,ENTP,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. I tend to feel a lot of anxiety, especially when things go wrong. It seems to be a natural tendency when I look back at the experience of feeling a lot of anxiety when I was chased by time limits such as performance evaluation from childhood."
11621,194,1,20,ENTP,41,<no>  think calling is better than texting. This is because waiting time for text messages is so frustrating and I prefer to know and solve the things I want to know at once through a phone call.
11622,194,1,20,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  I like to understand other opinions than mine. It's because I can't necessarily see that my opinion is right, and I like to know why that person came to think that way, and there are experiences where my thoughts have changed when I go through that process."
11623,194,1,20,ENTP,43,"<neutrality>  It seems that the type of person you are determines whether I contact you first. If you're really close friends, you'll just call them when you have time, but if you're not that close, you won't bother contacting them first."
11624,194,1,20,ENTP,44,<neutrality>  don't think I'm going to go back to the plan. I tend to find things I can do right now that fit the situation and try to do things that go well with that plan.
11625,194,1,20,ENTP,45,"<Yes>  I tend to regret a lot. Lately, I've been feeling a lot of regret for feeling sorry for the people around me. I think why did I do that at that time to make that person uncomfortable?"
11626,194,1,20,ENTP,46,<neutrality>  I tend not to think too deeply or not too deeply about human existence. I just think there must be a reason I was born and I try to live as hard as possible in reality.
11627,194,1,20,ENTP,47,"<Yes>  I am not good at controlling my emotions. I tend to show a lot of emotion on my face, and I tend to feel a lot of changes in my feelings toward me."
11628,194,1,20,ENTP,48,"<neutrality>  Depending on how much the other person's fault is, I think my behavior will change. In the case of a clearly bad mistake, the fact that the other person's face is not important, but the fact that it has adversely affected society is important, and in the case of a good mistake, it seems that the other person understands the other person's intention and understands the mistake."
11641,195,1,20,ENFJ,1,"<neutrality>  I'm not shy about making new friends, but I prefer to connect more closely with people I already know. I love meeting people, so I spend more time with close people. In that respect, making new friends isn't bad, but I don't make new friends periodically."
11642,195,1,20,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  I always like to learn new things, explore knowledge, and develop. So even after work, I try to take lectures related to my job, look for opportunities for training, and develop myself. Recently, I have been interested in data labeling independently of my job duties, so I am participating in various projects."
11643,195,1,20,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  I usually easily empathize with others and am good at conveying emotions. So even when I watch a drama or a movie, I empathize well, so I substitute myself for the main character, and my emotions are overflowing. When I see someone else crying, I also turn into a crying person and comfort them."
11644,195,1,20,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  Maybe because I have a lot of imagination, I tend to think a lot ahead of time. I think of a solution by asking the question, ¡°What should I do when an extreme situation occurs that I feel is too much?¡± I always think about when things go wrong, so I think in many ways no matter what I do, and I like that I can handle things skillfully when things go wrong."
11645,195,1,20,ENFJ,5,"<no>  I try to keep my composure in a high pressure environment, but I am very nervous and trembling inside. When external stimuli come in, my body stiffens and my head goes blank. On the outside, I say I maintain my composure, but in my heart, it's not like that at all."
11646,195,1,20,ENFJ,6,"<neutrality> It may be different depending on the environment, but when I first go to an unfamiliar place, I find people I already know and talk to them, and when the place becomes more comfortable, new people gradually come to my eyes and introduce me."
11647,195,1,20,ENFJ,7,"<neutrality> This also depends on my condition and stamina. When concentration is good, I finish one project completely and then work on another, but if I get tired of it in the middle of a project and can't concentrate, I look at efficiency and find other projects more attractive or when a good idea suddenly comes up, I stop what I'm doing and do something else. I tend to do projects."
11648,195,1,20,ENFJ,8,"<Yes>  I usually empathize well, and I tend to be absorbed in my imagination alone, so I think I'm on the very sentimental side."
11649,195,1,20,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  I always write a diary. I even use a notepad and scheduler app on my phone, and I have a diary for work and a diary for my day at home. I tend to forget things, so I tend to record what I have to do here and there and what happened."
11650,195,1,20,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  have perfectionist tendencies and self-blame. So, if I do well 10 times and make a minor mistake 1 time, I doubt my ability, saying ""Why didn't I see this... I'm crazy""."
11651,195,1,20,ENFJ,11,<neutrality>  I think I really think a lot before approaching someone I'm interested in and approach it carefully and as naturally as possible.
11652,195,1,20,ENFJ,12,"<no>  Works of art have so many different interpretations, so it's interesting to hear people's different opinions and views."
11653,195,1,20,ENFJ,13,"<neutrality>  It's different when it comes to dealing with public and private affairs, but in public, I try to follow my reason, and in private, I think I follow my emotions a little more. However, since there are so many different situations, I often use the two in combination. So there are people who see me emotionally, and there are people who are cool-headed."
11654,195,1,20,ENFJ,14,"<neutrality>  plan my schedule for the day, but I don't necessarily achieve everything just by planning. Whenever the desire to improvise is strong, I tend to follow it."
11655,195,1,20,ENFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to care a lot about how others see me. Because I value relationships with people, I think I react sensitively to that reputation."
11656,195,1,20,ENFJ,16,"<neutrality>  I like to do group activities and hang out with a lot of people, but I'm a person who needs time alone, so I don't seem to enjoy it."
11657,195,1,20,ENFJ,17,"<no>  I prefer movies or books with definite endings rather than open endings. Because I like things to be precise. In that sense, I like the Hunger Games."
11658,195,1,20,ENFJ,18,"<Yes> Of course, my success is important, but I think I underestimate my success and feel more rewarding and proud that I helped others. The reason is probably because I care about others and think that work for the whole is important."
11659,195,1,20,ENFJ,19,"<Yes>  When I was preparing for a job change, I had a lot of thoughts about whether to take on the challenge of meteorology, which I had wanted to become for a long time, or whether I should get a job quickly after taking the national exam and getting a license. It would be really nice to do both, but I think I thought a lot because I didn't have enough time or money to do that."
11660,195,1,20,ENFJ,20,<Yes>  I tend to think ahead of the worst case scenario. I think the obsession to do everything perfectly makes me worry about things going wrong.
11661,195,1,20,ENFJ,21,"<no>  I prefer to take on a leadership role. I have a sense of responsibility, and if there is no one who leads the organization in a peaceful and harmonious way like me, I want to play that role. For everyone and even for the group."
11662,195,1,20,ENFJ,22,"<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. I think that art is the free expression of one's feelings or thoughts, and everyone has their own artistic inclination."
11663,195,1,20,ENFJ,23,<no>  I think it would have been a clich?d world if only rationality had been considered. I think life is rich and beautiful only when there are emotions.
11664,195,1,20,ENFJ,24,"<neutrality> If it's too dirty, I think it would be more comfortable to take a break after finishing the housework quickly, but if not, I think I'll take a break and do the housework, even if it's short."
11665,195,1,20,ENFJ,25,"<no>  It's good to hear each other's point of view through an argument, but it's not fun to watch an argument because it often turns into a conflict."
11666,195,1,20,ENFJ,26,"<Yes>  I'm not trying to get other people's attention. I think humility is a virtue, and those gazes are burdensome and embarrassing."
11667,195,1,20,ENFJ,27,"<Yes>  I am an emotional person, so my emotions come and go several times a day. For example, when something irritates me, even if I get angry, I rationalize it and calm it down, and then I see that the resentment comes back and I eat spicy food to relieve it. It seems that emotions change really quickly."
11668,195,1,20,ENFJ,28,"<Yes> When I see someone who is not efficient, I feel frustrated and want to help. I tried to help like that once, but the other person insisted on doing it my way, so I got very annoyed."
11669,195,1,20,ENFJ,29,"<no>  If I put it off until the end, I tend to take care of the things I have to do in advance because I feel uncomfortable and anxious about the urgency."
11670,195,1,20,ENFJ,30,"<Yes>  It's a part I haven't experienced, and I'm interested in it because it's amazing that such a world exists. I'm more curious when I see someone claiming to have experienced something they haven't experienced."
11671,195,1,20,ENFJ,31,"<Yes>  I like spending time alone, but if I keep spending time alone, I get depressed. I like to spend time talking with close people."
11672,195,1,20,ENFJ,32,"<neutrality>  I'm not very interested in the discussion itself, but when I listen to the original story, I feel that my range of thinking deepens, and I can come across various opinions during the discussion, so I'm neutral."
11673,195,1,20,ENFJ,33,"<Yes>  tend to be good at empathy, so I tend to think that it could be like that from that person¡¯s point of view."
11674,195,1,20,ENFJ,34,"<no>  It takes some time because I think carefully when making a decision, but I think I'm impatient and try to make it right away without delaying it until the end."
11675,195,1,20,ENFJ,35,"<no>  I make a decision hastily, and I have doubts about the result later, so I think about it. However, they often rationalize that the decision is irreversible."
11676,195,1,20,ENFJ,36,"<neutrality>  Relieve fatigue with fun parties and events, and spend time alone. Both are needed to relieve fatigue."
11677,195,1,20,ENFJ,37,"<Yes>  I am interested in pretty and artistic things, so I like to see various works directly or indirectly."
11678,195,1,20,ENFJ,38,<no>  I understand other people's feelings so well that I rarely consider my own feelings.
11679,195,1,20,ENFJ,39,"<Yes> To the extent that I have a separate planner at work, I feel proud when I write down the tasks to be done for the day in advance and erase the completed ones."
11680,195,1,20,ENFJ,40,"<no>  I think a lot ahead of time and care a lot about others, so there are many times when I feel insecure."
11681,195,1,20,ENFJ,41,"<neutrality>  I guess it varies from person to person and situation to situation. It is more comfortable to make a call if the other person is comfortable with it, and it is inconvenient to make a call if the other person is uncomfortable."
11682,195,1,20,ENFJ,42,"<Yes>  I like to hear various opinions, but if there is a completely different opinion, I think I'm curious about how that idea came about?"
11683,195,1,20,ENFJ,43,"<Yes>  I enjoy spending time with my friends, so I tend to actively set up dates first."
11684,195,1,20,ENFJ,44,"<Yes> If there is a problem with the plan, I try to find other ways as much as possible to avoid any disruption to the plan. Recently, when it was later than expected, I saved a crisis by asking for your understanding in advance."
11685,195,1,20,ENFJ,45,"<Yes>  I often think about what would have happened if I had made a different choice then. If we had broken up then, I think I would have felt a little more comfortable now."
11686,195,1,20,ENFJ,46,"<no>  I think everyone has a reason for human existence and life. Sometimes when I'm immersed in contemplation, I tend to think deeply about these topics."
11687,195,1,20,ENFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I tend to get swayed by my emotions, so I'm trying to control my emotions. That's why people around me say that when I'm cool-headed, I'm cool-headed."
11688,195,1,20,ENFJ,48,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on the person's attitude. I don't try to save face when the other person has done something wrong but shows an impudent attitude, and in the opposite case, I try to save face. Because it may be different from the person's intentions, and it's uncomfortable to see them embarrassed."
11701,196,1,30,INFP,1,"<no>  don't feel the need to make new friends, so I don't make new ones periodically. I often spend time with my old friends because I feel happier spending time and energy making new friends. I don't know if it's a natural way to make friends, but I don't deliberately make new friends periodically."
11702,196,1,30,INFP,2,"<Yes> Originally, I am interested in various fields. New things always bring freshness, so even if you don't intend to, that freshness often draws you to explore new interests. Recently, I am interested in property management."
11703,196,1,30,INFP,3,"<Yes>  When we see someone else crying, we often empathize with that person and want to cry together. It seems that this is because they have excellent empathy. For example, when someone is seen crying on a TV program, they often cry together."
11704,196,1,30,INFP,4,"<Yes>  I think that work doesn't always go as expected, so I try to prepare for it as well. If you are promoting something without a contingency plan, you will be anxious, so you must have a contingency plan so you can focus on your work with a stable mindset."
11705,196,1,30,INFP,5,"<no> Even in the same situation, there are many cases in which the pressure of the situation is more severe than that of others, and the pressure is intensified by imagining in the head that the situation is going worse. Recently, I was going out on time for an appointment, but before I arrived at the appointment, my phone was turned off due to low battery. At this time, I felt a sense of psychological pressure and was restless with anxiety."
11706,196,1,30,INFP,6,"<Yes> Approaching and appealing to new people is a difficult challenge for me. Because I think everyone is wary of strangers, the other person may be wary of me, and I think that I may feel displeased with strangers. I think it's better to just talk to someone you know rather than risk being offended by others."
11707,196,1,30,INFP,7,"<no> When I am working on one project and suddenly another project comes to my mind, I often work on it. So, I often start another project before I finish one project, because I often get bored with one thing. Recently, I got tired of doing some data labeling work, so I had an experience of doing data labeling for another project and then doing another data labeling job again."
11708,196,1,30,INFP,8,"<Yes>  think it's sentimental. This is because they feel their emotions more than others, even in the same circumstances. Even in the same situation, there are many cases that are more happy or sad than others. For example, even if I watch the same movie, there are often cases where I shed tears even though the person who watched it with me is okay."
11709,196,1,30,INFP,9,"<no>  don't like making plans very much. Because I think planning also takes a lot of energy. Because I think it is a better choice to use the energy that will be used to actually do the work, I often start working right away in a state of awareness of what to do."
11710,196,1,30,INFP,10,"<no> Don't dwell on small mistakes. Because everyone thinks they can make mistakes. Recently, when I was working, I misunderstood a very basic part and handled it incorrectly. I just reconfirmed the mistake, but I didn't blame myself or doubt my own ability. By brushing off my mistakes and doing the next job well, I proved to myself that the mistakes were just mistakes, not that my abilities were diminished."
11711,196,1,30,INFP,11,"<no> It's hard to have a conversation first with someone who is interested. I don't know if it's someone who's not interested, but I'm more careful because I have the mindset that I have to look good and want to look good to people who are interested. If there is someone I'm interested in at a gathering or something, I remember being unable to talk to that person, but talking to everyone else with relative ease."
11712,196,1,30,INFP,12,"<Yes>  think just looking at a work of art is enough. As soon as I saw the work, I felt that if I had any emotions or thoughts, that would be enough. Since there is no right answer when it comes to art, what each person feels is the right answer, and I don't think it's necessary to dig deep and discuss."
11713,196,1,30,INFP,13,"<Yes>  think emotions cloud momentary judgment. Emotions change over time. However, I think reason is helpful for rational judgment. Since reason is a property that changes less over time than emotion, I think that if you make a choice based on reason, you are less likely to regret it as a wrong decision even after time has passed. I think I tend to follow reason rather than emotion, and I tend to be evaluated as a rational person by those around me."
11714,196,1,30,INFP,14,"<Yes>  think it's a waste of energy to plan a day's schedule, so I tend to improvise what I want to do right away. Even when cleaning the house, I start by cleaning the area I want to clean first rather than doing it systematically."
11715,196,1,30,INFP,15,"<no> I'm not worried. I know I can't look good to everyone, and I don't think I need to look good to everyone. Even if I act the way I am, I think that someone can like me and someone can hate me. That's why I just have to live my natural self, and I don't think it's meaningful to be conscious of how I'll appear in the eyes of others."
11716,196,1,30,INFP,16,"<no>  do not enjoy group activities. I think that doing something with others basically consumes more energy than doing something alone. That's why I like to spend time alone, and I don't like group activities. It always has been, and it still is today."
11717,196,1,30,INFP,17,"<Yes> The reason I like books and movies where the ending can be interpreted freely is that I can make the work my own. I think it's attractive that I can keep the work as my own by completing the ending myself. Among the movies I recently watched, 'Hunt' ended with an open ending, and I liked that there was room for my own interpretation."
11718,196,1,30,INFP,18,"<no>  Like almost everyone else, I am basically a person who puts myself first before others. I think there are only a handful of people who would be more satisfied with the success of others than their own."
11719,196,1,30,INFP,19,"<Yes>  When you have so many interests, you have so many things you want to do that it's hard to focus on one thing at a time. And among the many interests that come to mind all at once, you have a hard time deciding which order to start with. There were many things I wanted to learn recently, such as foreign languages, coding, stocks, real estate, and marketing, but I couldn't start anything because I didn't know where to start."
11720,196,1,30,INFP,20,"<Yes>  When I do something, I always think of the worst case scenario. It is true that I naturally worry about work as I imagine the worst case scenario."
11721,196,1,30,INFP,21,"<Yes> Basically, I don't like group activities. It's because I think it takes more energy than doing activities alone. Furthermore, I don't want to take on the leadership role because I think that taking on the leadership role in the group's activities will consume even more energy. This is because I think the energy that drives work is also a kind of resource, so I want to use it as efficiently as possible. From my point of view, the most efficient way to use a resource called energy is to do some activity alone."
11722,196,1,30,INFP,22,"<no>  think you have a lot of artistic inclinations. I am good at creative design, and I was able to learn the instruments I learned as a child quite quickly. I don't think this has anything to do with artistic inclination at all. Also, I think that the ability to use language that touches people's emotions is excellent."
11723,196,1,30,INFP,23,"<Yes> Emotion is more subjective, reason is more objective. Reason is close to rational, so I think that judgment based on reason is truly a reasonable judgment for the majority. Emotions are microscopic, and rationality is macroscopic. The world is a place where many people live together, so I think we should focus on the majority and make decisions from a macroscopic perspective. That's why I think a world that values reason rather than emotion is a better world."
11724,196,1,30,INFP,24,"<no>  I like to take a break first. When I do something, I tend to do it better when I feel good enough to do it. If you take a break first, you are physically and mentally charged, and it is often more efficient to start working in this state. That's why I tend to take a break first to get the best condition, and then do housework."
11725,196,1,30,INFP,25,<no>  Not enjoyable at all. I think arguing is just a waste of time and a waste of emotion unless it's really necessary. I think it's rare that you don't get hurt in an argument. It can't be fun to watch people needlessly hurt each other.
11726,196,1,30,INFP,26,"<Yes>  I don't think there's anything good about attracting other people's attention unless it's a special situation where you have to get others' attention. So wherever I go, I try to avoid clothes with designs that stand out as much as possible, and I try to refrain from actions that stand out. I always think it's best to look normal, and I want to look normal."
11727,196,1,30,INFP,27,"<no>  It's not something that changes quickly. One emotion often persists. If you're in a bad mood for something, doing something else that will change your mood that day won't make you feel any better. On the other hand, if something good happens, even if other unpleasant things happen that day, I don't feel too bad and I tend to stay in a good mood."
11728,196,1,30,INFP,28,"<Yes>  When I see a co-worker who is frustrated with work, I feel uncomfortable inside. It's not even a feeling of annoyance, but it's definitely not a good feeling. I wondered why it took so long to do something that could be done quickly."
11729,196,1,30,INFP,29,"<Yes> It is often delayed until the end. Most of the work you have to do is painful. I want to delay the pain as much as possible. So, there are many cases in which we procrastinate as much as possible and rush to the end. Lately, I've been procrastinating on work until the deadline."
11730,196,1,30,INFP,30,<no>  Not interesting at all. I don't think the afterlife has any direct connection with real life because I think it's a topic that's far from the real world. I don't care at all if I think it has nothing to do with my life.
11731,196,1,30,INFP,31,"<no>  I like to spend time alone. Being with others takes a lot more energy because it means that you have to pay attention to that person to some extent. So I prefer to spend my time comfortably alone. Even these days, I often spend time alone."
11732,196,1,30,INFP,32,"<Yes>  I think the original story is boring because it is obvious. If it's not fresh, I don't think you need to take the time to listen to it. I started listening to the lecture because I thought I might get some useful information, but when the obvious story starts to come out, I stop watching the lecture."
11733,196,1,30,INFP,33,"<Yes>  it's possible. Even if the background is different, I think people can sympathize as much as they like because they have fundamentally common attributes. When I saw a scene in which a celebrity talked about how difficult and lonely he was during his popular days, I didn't think that was full. I imagined it in that person's position, and I thought it could have been difficult enough."
11734,196,1,30,INFP,34,"<no>  Making the decision itself is too easy. This is because when faced with a problem of choice, you can instinctively know which choice is the most advantageous for you. So making the decision itself is not difficult. Decisions are made fairly quickly."
11735,196,1,30,INFP,35,"<Yes> There must have been a reason for the decision already made, so I don't think about it again. I have faith that I would have made the most favorable choice for me in my choice."
11736,196,1,30,INFP,36,"<no>  I tend to relieve the fatigue of the week by spending time alone. I am most comfortable and happiest when I am alone. These days, I have time to recharge by spending time alone."
11737,196,1,30,INFP,37,<Yes>  like. This is because the stress is relieved just by appreciating works of art in art galleries. Seeing something beautiful in itself is refreshing and happy.
11738,196,1,30,INFP,38,"<no>  Understanding other people's feelings is not at all difficult. Personally, I think it's because I have excellent empathy."
11739,196,1,30,INFP,39,"<no>  think planning what to do every day is a waste of time. I don't think it's necessary to plan, because if you know what you need to do today, you can start doing it right away."
11740,196,1,30,INFP,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. It is because he is a worrying person by nature. There is no special occasion. Once you start to feel a little bit of anxiety, you often end up in a bad way, so you are surrounded by uncontrollable anxiety."
11741,196,1,30,INFP,41,<no>  I like to make phone calls. Because you can communicate with the other party instantly. It never occurred to me that I wanted to avoid making phone calls.
11742,196,1,30,INFP,42,"<no> I've never had to spend a lot of time trying to understand an opinion very different from mine. Because if you put yourself in his shoes and think about it, you can fully understand why he has such an opinion. I think this is an area of empathy. I am a very empathetic person, so it is not difficult for me to understand the position or thoughts of others."
11743,196,1,30,INFP,43,"<no> I'm someone who enjoys spending time alone, so I've never felt the need to contact a friend to meet up first. However, we do contact each other occasionally, but it is not for the purpose of meeting."
11744,196,1,30,INFP,44,"<Yes> I'm not the type to plan and act thoroughly, but if things don't go the way I pictured in my head, I try to correct them quickly and make things go the way I want. Recently, I had to start working quickly, but in a situation where it would take some time to actually get a job and start working, I gave up the company I applied for and applied for another company that could start working more quickly, and succeeded in getting a job. started working."
11745,196,1,30,INFP,45,"<no>  In the first place, it is not often that we recall the mistakes of a long time ago. Because I always try to do my best in the present, I rarely look back and dwell on the past."
11746,196,1,30,INFP,46,"<Yes>  I think that the reason for human existence and life is a subject that does not need to be deeply thought about. Because I don't have enough free time to think about these topics, and I don't find them very productive. I don't feel the need to think about the reason for living because I think it's so natural to live life to the best of my ability as long as I'm alive."
11747,196,1,30,INFP,47,"<no>  When I feel like my emotions are about to collapse, I tend to take care of myself and control my emotions well. So I don't think I'm driven by emotions."
11748,196,1,30,INFP,48,"<no>  don't particularly try to save face when the other person is at fault. Not because you don't want to save face for the wrongdoer, but because you don't feel the need to. It is very rare to feel the need to artificially save face."
11761,197,1,40,ESTP,1,<no>  It is not made regularly. The reason is to make true friends when I really want rather than periodically.
11762,197,1,40,ESTP,2,"<no>  I explore more of the one thing I really love rather than a variety of interests. The reason is that the level of concentration drops when you have several Guam screenings. So I tend to explore one more thing. I like remix music, so my job is to share remix music with comments on YouTube to subscribers."
11763,197,1,40,ESTP,3,<Yes>  I also want to cry when I see other people crying. The reason is that there are many times when the other person and I can form a consensus. So it seems more like that. I feel sorry for you.
11764,197,1,40,ESTP,4,"<Yes>  I tend to have several contingency plans in case things go wrong. The reason is that there were times when there was no contingency plan, but once I went through that situation, I automatically set up several contingency plans."
11765,197,1,40,ESTP,5,"<no>  I can't keep my composure. The reason is that when I am in a high-pressure environment, I tend to have little self-control, so I spurt out the place. It seems to be less stressful that way."
11766,197,1,40,ESTP,6,<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I already know. The reason seems to be that you can talk more comfortably if you have a conversation with someone you already know.
11767,197,1,40,ESTP,7,"<Yes>  I start another project after I fully complete one project. The reason is that when I talk about what I do, I open my cell phone, but if I do several things at the same time, it gets delayed. So, when many customers come, we ask for your understanding and, when we are done with one customer, we tend to deal with other customers."
11768,197,1,40,ESTP,8,"<no>  I'm more rational than very sentimental. The reason is, when I look at everything I do, I can see that reason takes precedence when I think about it."
11769,197,1,40,ESTP,9,"<no>  don't seem to like making plans. The reason is, to be honest, I don't even use the household account book. I manage card use text messages on my phone with an app, but honestly, rather than making a plan and spending money, it seems to be used when needed."
11770,197,1,40,ESTP,10,"<Yes>  often doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. The reason is that I recently tore off the customer's protective film while working on my cell phone. I've been doing this for 12 years, but there are still times when I think I'm incapable of handling things like this. At that time, I laugh and pass it over and calmly attach the film again. ha ha ha"
11771,197,1,40,ESTP,11,<Yes>  I'm not hard to start a conversation with someone I'm interested in. The reason is that there was a friend I was really interested in when I was in college.
11772,197,1,40,ESTP,12,"<Yes>  I don't seem to be very interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. I don't really like to discuss reasons. I don't think there's any need to discuss a work of art, just to appreciate it."
11773,197,1,40,ESTP,13,<Yes>  I tend to follow reason. The reason was that there were many better results when following reason rather than emotion. I heard a lot of people around you say that you are a very rational friend.
11774,197,1,40,ESTP,14,"<neutrality>  I like to plan my day and do things spontaneously. There are many times when it is not bad to judge and act differently depending on the reason. When meeting friends, rather than planning, we spontaneously decide on a place and have a drink, and there are times when it is better to work according to today's schedule when working."
11775,197,1,40,ESTP,15,"<Yes>  I tend not to worry about who I look to others. The reason is that I have a lot of optimism and less stress, so everything flows naturally, so it seems more like that."
11776,197,1,40,ESTP,16,"<no>  do not enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is that I mostly like to do things alone at home. So this time, I challenged myself to work from home and was able to get a license."
11777,197,1,40,ESTP,17,"<no>  don't like books and movies where I can interpret the ending in my own way. The reason is that when I take a movie as an example, I tend to watch the movie by adapting to the result rather than inferring the ending of the movie. Among my recent works, I really enjoyed Operation Seoul National University. Rather than interpreting the ending, I voted for that ending."
11778,197,1,40,ESTP,18,<no>  I get more satisfaction from my own success than from helping others succeed. The reason is that my success gives me greater benefits than my helpers.
11779,197,1,40,ESTP,19,"<no>  I am not. The reason is that all interests are concentrated in one thing. Everyone's interest is focused on YouTube broadcasting, and they've even gotten enough answers about it."
11780,197,1,40,ESTP,20,"<no>  I don't often worry about things going wrong. The reason is that I have a very optimistic personality, and my ability to deal with crises is a little better. So I'm not that worried about it."
11781,197,1,40,ESTP,21,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group whenever possible. The reason is that in high school, I once served as vice-president due to being pushed by my friends. So I would like to avoid taking on leadership roles whenever possible."
11782,197,1,40,ESTP,22,<no>  think I have artistic inclinations. The reason is that he is good at drawing and making things in his own way.
11783,197,1,40,ESTP,23,"<Yes>  I am a rational person. So I think the world would have been a better place if reason was more important than emotion. The reason is that if you value emotions, you often see that you are only led by them and do not get any better. Our groom is like that. You can see it from the side. It is also reason rather than emotion."
11784,197,1,40,ESTP,24,"<no>  I don't finish chores before going to bed. The reason is that if you think about the meaning of the word rest, it means that my body is resting comfortably. But why do housework first?? Rest is just doing nothing and allowing my body to relax, and then it's not too late to do housework."
11785,197,1,40,ESTP,25,"<no>  don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that when I watch the debate, I feel very stuffy inside."
11786,197,1,40,ESTP,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. The reason seems to be because of my blood type. My blood type is A, so I'm a bit timid. So it seems more like that."
11787,197,1,40,ESTP,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly. For a reason, it tends to last a little longer if you get angry."
11788,197,1,40,ESTP,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who are not effective. The reason is because it used to be when I was in middle school. No matter what the friend next to me was doing, I was always lying on my stomach, but it wasn't once or twice that I got so annoyed that I got angry at that friend just by looking at him. Thinking about it now, I feel sorry for that friend."
11789,197,1,40,ESTP,29,"<no>  I do not procrastinate. The reason is that if you procrastinate, it accumulates and accumulates, making it difficult to solve. So I don't procrastinate."
11790,197,1,40,ESTP,30,<no>  I am not interested in the afterlife. There can be only one reason. I am a rational person.
11791,197,1,40,ESTP,31,"<no>  I like to spend time alone. The reason is that after getting married, I have a groom next to me, a son, and even my father-in-law living together. At least, when I broadcast on YouTube, I have time to myself properly, so I really like that time."
11792,197,1,40,ESTP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I find principled stories boring. The reason is, for example, when I was in college, there was a time when I had discussion theory on a certain topic, but since it wasn't my interest every time, I felt that it was too boring and boring to deal with such things. It's so boring and no fun at all."
11793,197,1,40,ESTP,33,"<no>  I cannot easily empathize with someone whose background is completely different from mine. The reason is that I felt like a person living in a completely different world when I met someone who lived a life completely different from mine, and there was no consensus."
11794,197,1,40,ESTP,34,"<Yes>  tend to put off making decisions until the last minute. The reason was that it wasn't like that when I was alone, but after getting married, there were many times when the groom made all the decisions, not me. That's why I often put off making decisions."
11795,197,1,40,ESTP,35,"<Yes>  I tend not to reconsider decisions I have already made. The reason is that the decision has already been made, but I think that overturning it again can harm others other than me."
11796,197,1,40,ESTP,36,"<no>  I can't get tired of the week with parties or events. The reason is that I have a busy day at the store, so rather than parties or events, I like to just be comfortable at home alone."
11797,197,1,40,ESTP,37,<neutrality>  I neither hate nor like going to art galleries. The reason seems to be more because I don't have time because I'm hit by life.
11798,197,1,40,ESTP,38,"<Yes>  I often find it difficult to understand other people's feelings. The reason is that there are so many times when I don't understand when I talk to my husband. I think it's completely different from the groom's opinion, but there were many times when I couldn't understand it at all even if I thought about it from the groom's point of view."
11799,197,1,40,ESTP,39,"<no>  don't like to plan my daily to-dos. The reason is that I plan my work, but my personal work is often impromptu, so I like to do things at that time."
11800,197,1,40,ESTP,40,"<no>  There are many times when I feel a lot of anxiety these days. The reason is that the store was robbed because I was careless while running a mobile phone store, and since then I feel a lot of anxiety. But these days, I'm a little concerned about safety, so I'm a little anxious."
11801,197,1,40,ESTP,41,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that there are many times when I can't speak properly because I don't have a lot of people around me, so I often exchange text messages rather than phone calls."
11802,197,1,40,ESTP,42,"<no>  don't spend a lot of time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. The reason is that if you have a different opinion, you tend to respect that person's opinion, but it seems pointless to spend time understanding that opinion."
11803,197,1,40,ESTP,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to contact my friends to meet up first. The reason is that I'm not the first person to contact, but it seems more like that. My friends in college talk about it a lot. I often hear ""You're too out of touch""."
11804,197,1,40,ESTP,44,"<no>  If my plan goes wrong, I don't try to get back to it as quickly as possible. I tend to turn around, think about it, and just improvise in a crisis."
11805,197,1,40,ESTP,45,"<Yes>  often regret mistakes made long ago. The reason is that before the wedding, I left the house because the marriage was postponed due to problems with the groom's parents and the promise was not fulfilled, and I regret it so much. Because of that incident, both me and the groom were hurt more. Even today, there are times when we talk about it. I really regret it."
11806,197,1,40,ESTP,46,"<Yes>  tend not to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. The reason why we humans were born is that, religiously speaking, Heavenly Father created us, and humanly speaking, our parents gave birth to us, and life continues until the day we die."
11807,197,1,40,ESTP,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions rather than being swayed by them. The reason is that I think I am good at controlling my emotions, and many people around me say that I am a rational person."
11808,197,1,40,ESTP,48,"<no> I'm not trying to save the other person's face. The reason is obviously wrong, but I think it's right to let people know that it's wrong."
11821,198,1,40,ISFP,1,"<no>  I don't make it unless I have a job to meet new people. When I meet a new friend, it's hard to consume energy to tell me about myself again."
11822,198,1,40,ISFP,2,"<no>  don't have many interests. I tend to lead a basic, repetitive life. But these days, I need to replace the car black box, so I'm looking into it."
11823,198,1,40,ISFP,3,"<Yes>  When I see people's sad feelings in dramas or documentaries, I shed tears as well. It's not because I'm sad, but because I can understand emotions."
11824,198,1,40,ISFP,4,"<neutrality> Depending on the situation, I make preparations and sometimes I try blindly. If I think it's important, I'll make preparations in advance, but if it's not, there are times when I just do it."
11825,198,1,40,ISFP,5,"<neutrality>  I have a hard time keeping my composure in more difficult situations mentally, but I tend to be calm about things that aren't my fault. In the case of a traffic accident, even when I was involved in an accident, I was very sick, but I calmly responded."
11826,198,1,40,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I don't often have parties or events. If I go, I will talk to people I know because I would have gone through an invitation from acquaintances or people I know. I hate talking to new people because it's awkward."
11827,198,1,40,ISFP,7,"<no> When I am stuck or unsolved while working on a project, I tend to work on another project and then go back to the original project. When something went wrong and it seemed like I needed to look at it from a different perspective, there were often things that were resolved by focusing on something else and then going back to the task I saw."
11828,198,1,40,ISFP,8,"<neutrality>  I think I am generally sentimental, but I tend to refrain from doing business or public events. I like to imagine and I enjoy thinking about what-ifs."
11829,198,1,40,ISFP,9,"<neutrality>  I write important dates, but I don't plan. I enter things to celebrate or good things in my diary or cell phone calendar."
11830,198,1,40,ISFP,10,"<no>  I'm not the type to beat myself up for small mistakes. I tend to believe in myself, so I think I won't do that next time. If you can't follow the things you do every day, I think you can do it tomorrow without forgetting it."
11831,198,1,40,ISFP,11,"<no>  Even if I'm interested, it's hard to have a conversation with someone I don't know. Doesn't even try. And I never approached and talked to him first."
11832,198,1,40,ISFP,12,"<neutrality>  It depends on the artwork, but it's good to hear from others about the work you love. I might see other perspectives that I hadn't thought of."
11833,198,1,40,ISFP,13,"<neutrality>  try to judge rationally, but sometimes I judge emotionally. People around you hear that you are rational."
11834,198,1,40,ISFP,14,"<no>  I have a basic schedule for the day. Among them, there are times when I improvise when necessary. When I go on a trip, I make a plan for the day, and if there is a place I want to see suddenly in the middle, I go right away."
11835,198,1,40,ISFP,15,"<Yes>  don't want others to see me as a bad person. There was a case where I didn't get along with someone else, but that person was an acquaintance of someone I knew."
11836,198,1,40,ISFP,16,<no>  I don't like group activities. It's better to enjoy a small group meeting or alone than a large group of people.
11837,198,1,40,ISFP,17,<no>  I like stuff that has an ending. I don't like open endings because they feel empty. There are no recent favorites.
11838,198,1,40,ISFP,18,"<Yes>  I like my own success, but I think it's better to be happy to help someone who can do better than me. If I'm not good at my field, I think it's right that people who do well should succeed."
11839,198,1,40,ISFP,19,"<no>  I never had a lot of interests, so I didn't know what to do. No experience."
11840,198,1,40,ISFP,20,"<neutrality>  I tend to worry about things that are really important and that need to be resolved, but sometimes I think it's okay. I realized that just worrying doesn't change the results."
11841,198,1,40,ISFP,21,<Yes>  I tend to play a supporting role rather than a leading leader. I don't think there is a leadership that can convince and lead others.
11842,198,1,40,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  I like to listen to music and read books, but I'm not good at making or writing my own. Writing a book or drawing a picture feels difficult."
11843,198,1,40,ISFP,23,"<no>  I think emotions are as necessary as rational ones. Rather than leaning towards one side, I believe that the necessary elements are different depending on the situation or work."
11844,198,1,40,ISFP,24,<Yes>  I like to do housework and relax. That way you can rest comfortably for a long time. I don't think I can relax because I think I have to do housework.
11845,198,1,40,ISFP,25,"<neutrality>  I don't mind anything that needs to be discussed and resolved, but I don't like things that don't. I don't like anything that looks more like a fight than an argument."
11846,198,1,40,ISFP,26,<no>  try not to do anything that draws other people's attention. I try to do my job quietly.
11847,198,1,40,ISFP,27,"<neutrality>  I'm not the type to change my emotions quickly, but sometimes I feel better when I watch a funny movie after watching a sad movie."
11848,198,1,40,ISFP,28,"<neutrality>  I'm not an efficient person, so I don't get annoyed when others do. When processing work, if the documents to be handed over are not handed over even though I work hard even if it is late, I was notified of the work and received the documents."
11849,198,1,40,ISFP,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to prioritize things first. However, there are times when we put off things that we need to ask for. I have to request repairs for apartment defects, but I have an experience of delaying the schedule."
11850,198,1,40,ISFP,30,"<Yes>  I think stories about the afterlife are fun. We are experiencing the past and the present, but we cannot experience the world after that."
11851,198,1,40,ISFP,31,"<neutrality>  I enjoy being alone, but I also enjoy being with family and close friends. These days, I tend to meet people close to me."
11852,198,1,40,ISFP,32,<Yes>  I am more interested in situations or studies that are emerging or changing rather than original stories. There are things that were taken for granted in the past that should disappear or become damage as the times change.
11853,198,1,40,ISFP,33,"<neutrality>  I think it depends on the situation you are in. Even if the background is different, depending on the situation, you can become a comrade. In difficult situations, you may need to work together."
11854,198,1,40,ISFP,34,"<neutrality>  I tend to make decisions quickly if I can decide alone or if it's my own business, but if I have to decide together or if someone else is involved, I tend to make decisions carefully."
11855,198,1,40,ISFP,35,"<Yes>  I tend to quickly forget about the past, so I don't reconsider the decisions I've made. Even if you think about the things that have already passed, you can't go back."
11856,198,1,40,ISFP,36,"<no>  I tend to enjoy relaxing through my alone time. I like to organize what has happened and what to do next, or to be without thinking."
11857,198,1,40,ISFP,37,"<Yes>  I don't go often, but if I get a chance, I like going to art galleries. I often look at photo albums or pictures with famous paintings without thinking."
11858,198,1,40,ISFP,38,"<neutrality>  I can understand if I've had a similar experience or felt the same way. But sometimes it's hard to understand things you haven't experienced. For example, I cannot understand the feelings of a condemned prisoner before his death penalty."
11859,198,1,40,ISFP,39,<no>  I don't like making plans unless it's necessary or important. I tend to move flexibly depending on what I have to do that day or the situation. Making a plan creates the stress of having to stick to it.

11861,198,1,40,ISFP,41,"<neutrality>  I tend to enjoy talking on the phone with people I know or close to, but I want to avoid talking with people I don't know for business purposes. It's because there are cases where you don't speak well or are delivered differently than you intended."
11862,198,1,40,ISFP,42,"<Yes> If I have a different opinion, I tend to think about it on the side of that opinion as well. I think that's how you can understand and convince other people's point of view. When negotiating the unit price of a product, we were able to agree on an appropriate unit price by considering various items included in the unit price."

The train was delayed and I couldn't go where I was supposed to go, so I changed my schedule to another nearby location."
11865,198,1,40,ISFP,45,"<neutrality>  I tend to forget my mistakes right away, but sometimes I wish I hadn't. But I don't have many regrets."

11868,198,1,40,ISFP,48,"<neutrality>  tend to point out the other person's faults if they are aware of them and if they are serious, but if the other person is unaware of their faults, I try to point them out in an indirect way. I think there are fewer mistakes next time when you realize your mistakes yourself rather than others telling you."
11881,199,0,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  It's hard to get close to people you've never seen before. The friends I'm meeting right now are friends I've been friends with for decades, so I'm comfortable with people I'm just meeting."
11882,199,0,30,ISTJ,2,"<Yes>  I am curious to know what other people know. I like to chat because I know many things. Recently, I like soccer, so I look for a lot of news or news about the transfer of soccer players."
11883,199,0,30,ISTJ,3,"<neutrality> It depends on the situation, but if the other person is crying over something that has nothing to do with me, the tears won't come out. If a close person does that, I get upset, but I don't shed tears. In this situation, I wonder why that person is like that, so I ask and talk together."
11884,199,0,30,ISTJ,4,"<Yes>  You don't know what might suddenly burst into the guerrilla castle, so you're making preparations. I don't tend to set it up too much, but in some cases, I'll do it this way or that way."

11886,199,0,30,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  have an introverted personality and have a lot of strangers, so I don't go to places with a lot of people, but when I go to places with a lot of people, I stick around and talk with people I know. I think the reason is because it's uncomfortable because it's awkward, and it's uncomfortable because I'm afraid I'll do something like a mistake to others."
11887,199,0,30,ISTJ,7,"<Yes>  It is not the personality of overlapping several tasks, but the personality of doing another after one is finished. When I do multiple things, it's hard to concentrate on one place and I sometimes make mistakes, so I don't overlap."

11892,199,0,30,ISTJ,12,"<Yes>  I'm good at talking about things I'm interested in, but I'm not good at discussing areas I don't know. The reason seems to be because I pretend to know it and if I make a mistake, I am embarrassed and blame myself."
11893,199,0,30,ISTJ,13,"<no> I'm the kind of person who only meets people I meet, so I tend to say only good things to hear in order to continue to have a good relationship with that person.

12018,201,1,30,ENTJ,18,"<no>  I am more satisfied with my success than others. It is of course satisfying to help others succeed, but it is not as satisfying as my own success."
12019,201,1,30,ENTJ,19,"<Yes> Sometimes there are too many interests, so there are times when you worry. Recently, there was a time when I was thinking about what to do during a short break, and I just skipped it without doing anything."
12020,201,1,30,ENTJ,20,<no>  I'm not the type to worry in advance that things might go wrong. It's because I don't think anything will change if I worry in advance.
12021,201,1,30,ENTJ,21,<Yes>  I want to avoid leadership roles. The reason is that I have to work a lot and I am tired because I can't do it roughly due to my personality.
12022,201,1,30,ENTJ,22,"<no>  think you have artistic inclinations. It's because I don't wear clothes, and I think I have a sense of decorating my house."
12023,201,1,30,ENTJ,23,"<Yes>  If I had put more emphasis on reason than emotion, I think I would have made a more rational choice and not left a stain on history."
12024,201,1,30,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  When I start to rest, I want to finish my chores before taking a break because I want to be fully rested without moving at all."
12025,201,1,30,ENTJ,25,<no>  don't enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is because I hate being noisy and tired.
12026,201,1,30,ENTJ,26,"<Yes>  I just want to be quiet and avoid annoying things as much as possible, so I try not to draw attention from others."
12027,201,1,30,ENTJ,27,"<neutrality>  It seems to be different from time to time depending on the situation. Because when you are busy or stressed, your emotions change very quickly, but when you are calm, your emotions do not change."
12028,201,1,30,ENTJ,28,"<Yes>  Recently, when I was working at a company, I saw my boss who couldn't even do simple things, and I thought, why can't I do it, why do I work like that?"
12029,201,1,30,ENTJ,29,"<Yes>  Lately, things have been bothering me a lot, so there were many times when I procrastinated as much as possible and worked as if I was being chased."
12030,201,1,30,ENTJ,30,<no>  The question isn't interesting because there isn't much interest in the afterlife itself.
12031,201,1,30,ENTJ,31,"<Yes> These days, there are many times when I feel very lonely, probably because of the season, so I want to spend time with other people."
12032,201,1,30,ENTJ,32,<Yes>  I think theory-oriented discussions are stuck in a rut and can't come up with a solution.
12033,201,1,30,ENTJ,33,"<neutrality>  If the background you've lived in is completely different, you might be interested, but it's hard to relate easily. In order to empathize, there must be something in common with me or my experience must be based, but without that, I think it would be a bit difficult."
12034,201,1,30,ENTJ,34,<no>  tend to make decisions quickly. It's just that I keep thinking about it again and again.
12035,201,1,30,ENTJ,35,"<no>  Even if you've already made a decision, think it over again. The reason is that I also think that my decision may have been wrong."
12036,201,1,30,ENTJ,36,"<neutrality>  It's good to spend time with others, but I also need time to reorganize myself, so I often have time alone."
12037,201,1,30,ENTJ,37,"<Yes> If I have a chance to go to Seoul, I definitely visit the exhibition. It's because there are not many opportunities to see the exhibition in the province."
12038,201,1,30,ENTJ,38,"<Yes>  When a friend breaks up with a lover or has a fight, sometimes I can't sympathize. Personally, I don't understand it well."
12039,201,1,30,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my to-dos for the next day before I go to bed, and I like to plan my to-dos for the day before starting work."
12040,201,1,30,ENTJ,40,<no>  have a natural tendency to be timid and often feel insecure. I consciously try not to be anxious.
12041,201,1,30,ENTJ,41,"<no>  When I was young, I was anxious about talking on the phone and wanted to avoid it, but now I don't avoid talking on the phone because I think it's the fastest solution."
12042,201,1,30,ENTJ,42,"<no>  If there is a conflict of opinion during a meeting, I tend to spend a lot of time rethinking and trying to understand the other person's opinion throughout the day."
12043,201,1,30,ENTJ,43,"<Yes>  There was a friend I couldn't see anymore because I didn't get in touch in the past, so these days I tend to contact him first."
12044,201,1,30,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  If there is a setback in the plan, we immediately check where it went wrong. The work I was working on recently had an error in the middle of the work, so I did not proceed as it was, but corrected it and finished it well."
12045,201,1,30,ENTJ,45,"<Yes>  regret fighting with a friend a long time ago and not contacting you because of my pride. If I had contacted you first, I would not have lost contact with you now."
12046,201,1,30,ENTJ,46,"<Yes>  Originally, I wasn't good at profound and philosophical thoughts, and these days I don't have time to do it, so I seem to avoid thinking deeply."
12047,201,1,30,ENTJ,47,<no>  I am good at controlling my emotions in social and corporate life. It is also evaluated that way by those around you.
12048,201,1,30,ENTJ,48,"<Yes> During company life, the other person's fault is obvious, but he makes a lot of effort to save his boss's face. It's business life."
12061,202,1,40,ENTJ,1,"<Yes>  It's not something I want to make, I like to do different things, so I make new friends every time I try something new. Since I try new things regularly, I think I make friends regularly."
12062,202,1,40,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  really like to learn. So these days, I'm interested in social welfare, so I'm studying."
12063,202,1,40,ENTJ,3,<Yes>  yes. a lot. I get the feeling that the person's feelings are well understood. sad together It feels like being a party.
12064,202,1,40,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  I hate it when things go wrong, and when things go wrong, I have to come up with a workaround to put my mind at ease."
12065,202,1,40,ENTJ,5,"<neutrality> It's hard to keep your composure. However, I try not to show it and try to overcome it with positive thoughts. There was a deadline pressure for work a while ago, and I really wanted to quit, but I persevered."
12066,202,1,40,ENTJ,6,"<neutrality>  If you know a lot of people, you can talk to people you already know, but in order to have a conversation with a new person, make a conversation and approach them. The more you meet different people, the more different experiences you have."
12067,202,1,40,ENTJ,7,"<no> Digging into just one seems to be a big risk these days, so I have at least two and coordinate them. If I do just one thing, I get bored or tired."
12068,202,1,40,ENTJ,8,"<no>  It doesn't seem like very much. If I think this is not the case, I don't get sympathy for it, and I usually think that it's not good to be too sentimental, maybe because I have a bit of a pitiful feeling about sentimental things."
12069,202,1,40,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  Once you have a plan in place, you will feel at ease. This is because it can respond to variables. And since they have to be memos, I tend to organize them in a cell phone scheduler or Excel."
12070,202,1,40,ENTJ,10,"<Yes> Now that I¡¯m in my 40s, I feel a bit depressed. I think I've become a bit timid compared to when I was at my peak. Recently, while watching a Korean quiz, I was trying to get the correct answer, but the answer I confidently gave came out wrong. At that time, I was very frustrated because I thought that my knowledge was only this much."
12071,202,1,40,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  First of all, I approach you with a smile and talk about daily life, talk about issues in society, express my opinions, and talk about this and that."
12072,202,1,40,ENTJ,12,<Yes>  Because there is no answer to the interpretation of a work of art. I am not interested in vaguely various interpretations.
12073,202,1,40,ENTJ,13,"<Yes>  When I judge myself, I think I tend to follow reason. Emotional things are often at a loss. If you see people around you say that you are half and half, it seems that you are not just following the opposite sex."
12074,202,1,40,ENTJ,14,"<no> When I improvise, the empty time is too precious. Even if I can't do everything I planned, I like to plan and do things."
12075,202,1,40,ENTJ,15,<no>  I have the idea that I want others to see me as the image I think when they see me. First impressions are important and I think that any meeting has a purpose... It is a caution that there is nothing good by looking bad.
12076,202,1,40,ENTJ,16,"<Yes> It is fun and fun to go with a group rather than playing alone. These days, I regularly go to brunch and exercise groups."
12077,202,1,40,ENTJ,17,"<no>  I prefer tight-closed endings to controversial open endings. Like a happy ending, it's good to have an end somehow after watching it. So, among the movies I watched recently, I enjoyed watching Crime City 2."
12078,202,1,40,ENTJ,18,<no>  feel more satisfied when I do well. I think I will feel jealous if I help someone succeed and that person is better than me.
12079,202,1,40,ENTJ,19,"<Yes>  I want to learn swimming, I want to learn YouTube video editing, I want to learn English, but I only have time to do one thing."
12080,202,1,40,ENTJ,20,<Yes> It seems that I have a lot of worries about that kind of personality. I tend to worry about useless things. I think the reason is because I want to do well so I don't want to make mistakes.
12081,202,1,40,ENTJ,21,"<Yes>  There is so much work, and I feel like I have to do well to pay for it. There is a sense of accomplishment, but too much time is wasted and it is difficult to lead when opinions do not match."
12082,202,1,40,ENTJ,22,"<Yes>  Like math, I like to fit. When I see a work of art, I don't get much inspiration, and I don't have much empathy."
12083,202,1,40,ENTJ,23,"<Yes>  I don't mean to think completely rationally, but I think that if emotions are excluded a little more, the world will go well without unnecessary consumption."
12084,202,1,40,ENTJ,24,"<no>  If you need a break right now, I think it's good to take a break. I think I can do it more efficiently if I do housework after I rest and recharge."
12085,202,1,40,ENTJ,25,"<Yes>  It's interesting how it goes. How would I respond if I had the same opinion as mine, but it was going against me? You seem to enjoy thinking about it."
12086,202,1,40,ENTJ,26,"<no>  It used to be more like that, but common sense makes it okay to draw people around. I think it's too waste of time to be conscious of other people's eyes."
12087,202,1,40,ENTJ,27,"<neutrality>  It doesn't change quickly, but it doesn't seem to change, so it seems to be in the middle. If I was going to change quickly, I don't think I would have expressed those feelings in advance."
12088,202,1,40,ENTJ,28,"<Yes>  feel like I'm wasting my life on something and it's frustrating. If it's due tonight, I'll solve the deadline first and then do other things, but when I see my acquaintances who are late for the deadline, I get really excited."
12089,202,1,40,ENTJ,29,"<no>  In the past, I put it off until the end, but these days, when I put off something I have to do, I worry about it and it interferes with doing other things. So, if possible, do not delay."
12090,202,1,40,ENTJ,30,"<Yes> After the experience of letting go of my close pets and family, I've been thinking about it, and any questions about the afterlife have become interesting."
12091,202,1,40,ENTJ,31,"<Yes>  When I'm alone, I tend to get sentimental and stretch out a bit, so when my schedule is empty, I tend to invite my acquaintances a lot. The bustling atmosphere gives me strength."
12092,202,1,40,ENTJ,32,"<no>  Since I like clear theories more, I don't think I've ever thought of them being boring even if they're theoretical."
12093,202,1,40,ENTJ,33,"<no>  I tried to empathize with people from different backgrounds and tried to empathize with myself, but there were many things I couldn't empathize with... , I realized."
12094,202,1,40,ENTJ,34,"<Yes> Unless it's clearly decided that this is a good thing, I tend to put it off until I can. I don't know which is better... I keep thinking. And finally decide."
12095,202,1,40,ENTJ,35,<Yes>  It's because you've already thought about it enough and decided. So the decision takes a long time.
12096,202,1,40,ENTJ,36,"<Yes>  You can be alone anytime, but fun parties and events have schedules and dates. So, if there are parties and events, I use them to relieve fatigue."
12097,202,1,40,ENTJ,37,"<Yes> I'm not an artistic person, but I like to appreciate what I see. Especially if there is commentary."
12098,202,1,40,ENTJ,38,"<Yes> Sometimes it's hard to understand when a friend is upset and shows hard feelings. My friend is an education official and is upset that the salary is low, but I did not sympathize with her at all. I thought to myself, ¡°You will get a lot of pension later and have a guaranteed retirement age, right?¡± Aside from this, isn't it a bit weak to say that it's this hard? I think it's because there are times when I think about it."
12099,202,1,40,ENTJ,39,"<Yes> If you don't plan what to do every day, there are times when you forget. I feel weird then. So I plan ahead because I want to feel the sense of accomplishment when I plan things to do and complete them all. And I like it."
12100,202,1,40,ENTJ,40,"<no>  I don't pursue perfection, but I feel a lot of anxiety because I want to be perfect. I feel it when I'm late for an appointment, late for a deadline, or when something doesn't go my way."
12101,202,1,40,ENTJ,41,"<Yes>  don't know what situation the person is in and there is a vague anxiety about the feedback that will come back. That's why I prefer messengers, but I prefer messengers over phone calls because messengers leave records, so it's easier to remember later."
12102,202,1,40,ENTJ,42,"<no>  I don't take the time to understand. Even if that person is wrong, because opinions are just opinions. Understanding other opinions does not change my opinion, and I think it is unnecessary."
12103,202,1,40,ENTJ,43,"<Yes> When I was talking to my friend, at some point, he made an appointment to meet me first, so I think I'm the type to ask him to meet first."
12104,202,1,40,ENTJ,44,"<Yes>  I'm trying. Since the plan is meant to be followed, it is kept unless it is unavoidable. Recently, something suddenly happened on the day I was supposed to take the test, so I couldn't take the test that day and had to take it the next day."
12105,202,1,40,ENTJ,45,"<neutrality>  It's hard to live without regrets. However, if you regret a lot, it seems that life will be difficult now. I live while trying not to regret it. Because every moment is a choice and regret."
12106,202,1,40,ENTJ,46,"<neutrality> Once upon a time, I thought deeply. When my family left... But for me, it hurt me... My mind is devastated and I want to follow it, but it's not getting better, so I try not to think about it anymore."
12107,202,1,40,ENTJ,47,"<Yes>  I think I am swayed by my emotions, but people around me say I can control them. I think it's because I'm at an age where I can think rationally."
12108,202,1,40,ENTJ,48,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on what kind of person he is. I'll try to save face if I have a good personality and I'm not good at it, but if it's not, there's no need to save face..."
12121,203,0,30,INFJ,1,<no>  I'm not good at making it. It is better to enjoy a hobby by yourself rather than meeting people.
12122,203,0,30,INFJ,2,"<no>  I prefer to find peace of mind rather than exploration. That's why I play dramas, movies, and cell phone games."
12123,203,0,30,INFJ,3,"<no>  sympathize with your feelings, but I don't cry with you. But I try to empathize with the situation."
12124,203,0,30,INFJ,4,<Yes>  I tend to make a lot of plans. The reason is that I want to do it perfectly and I don't want to do anything that harms others.
12125,203,0,30,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  I keep my composure. The reason is that you can't do anything in a high-pressure environment, so it's important to keep your composure quickly."
12126,203,0,30,INFJ,6,"<neutrality>  It depends. When I go with people I know, I talk to people I know, but when I go to a party or event alone, I prefer to make friends with new people."
12127,203,0,30,INFJ,7,"<Yes>  After complete completion, start the next project. The reason is that doing two things at the same time doesn't work well."
12128,203,0,30,INFJ,8,"<no>  I am not sentimental. Likes to explore emotions, but not sentimental."
12129,203,0,30,INFJ,9,"<neutrality>  I like to make plans, but I prefer to realize what I have planned in my head rather than write it down in a diary or somewhere."
12130,203,0,30,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  I tend to be suspicious of even small mistakes. When I went on a trip, I made a plan and moved, but I remember that it wasn't good when I went. At that time, I remember thinking that I would go after looking for a little more all day."
12131,203,0,30,INFJ,11,"<no>  It is difficult to carry on a conversation with someone you are interested in. The reason is because it puts a lot of stress on it. It's because I feel like I have to do better because I'm interested in it, and I feel like I shouldn't make mistakes."
12132,203,0,30,INFJ,12,<no>  I am interested in discussing. Listening and sharing each other's thoughts is a good thing for me.
12133,203,0,30,INFJ,13,"<Yes> Follow reason. I prefer the emotional part, but when I work, I tend to think a lot according to the opposite sex."
12134,203,0,30,INFJ,14,"<no>  Do not improvise. The reason is that when you deviate from your plan, you try to plan again and move."
12135,203,0,30,INFJ,15,"<Yes>  Don't worry. In the past, I worried a lot, but I changed to a person who will live without paying attention to living once anyway."
12136,203,0,30,INFJ,16,<no>  Does not enjoy participating in group activities. Group activities take away my energy.
12137,203,0,30,INFJ,17,"<no>  I don't like it. The reason is that if I don't decide the ending, I'm full of my own thoughts, so I can't come to a conclusion either."
12138,203,0,30,INFJ,18,<Yes>  I find satisfaction in helping others. It makes me proud to see that others are doing well because of me rather than myself.
12139,203,0,30,INFJ,19,<Yes>  I worry because I have too many interests. I can't decide and just list what I want to do.
12140,203,0,30,INFJ,20,"<no> Worried but not too worried The reason is that even if you worry, it won't work out, so don't worry."
12141,203,0,30,INFJ,21,"<no>  Would. Rather than following someone, thinking and trying to lead seems more helpful to me."
12142,203,0,30,INFJ,22,"<no>  I have an artistic inclination. I like to think and imagine alone. So, when I was young, I learned to fold origami, and sometimes I would try to fold paper as my hand went."
12143,203,0,30,INFJ,23,<no> It won't be a better world. I think it will be a better world when emotions and reason coexist.
12144,203,0,30,INFJ,24,<no>  rest first Working when I'm tired is what accumulates my fatigue more.
12145,203,0,30,INFJ,25,<Yes>  It's interesting to argue. The reason is that we can hear each other's thoughts.
12146,203,0,30,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't want to get people's attention. The reason is that when I receive people's attention, I feel burdened and it becomes difficult to think that I have to raise expectations."
12147,203,0,30,INFJ,27,<no>  My feelings are calm. The reason is because I don't try to show my feelings.
12148,203,0,30,INFJ,28,"<Yes>  Efficiency matters. If you think about it a little, you can do it, but it's frustrating to see you do it without thinking about it."
12149,203,0,30,INFJ,29,<Yes>  I procrastinate what I have to do. It seems that the cynicism has gotten worse lately.
12150,203,0,30,INFJ,30,"<Yes> The afterlife is a subject of interest. The reason is that I like to imagine, so I draw more utopias about the future than realistic thoughts."
12151,203,0,30,INFJ,31,<no>  Better to spend some time alone. The reason seems to be speeding up.
12152,203,0,30,INFJ,32,"<no>  I think that everything has a cause, and I think that the principle is important because the situation is created depending on what the cause is."
12153,203,0,30,INFJ,33,"<Yes> They say they come from different backgrounds, but in the end, they are the same person. Rather, I am curious about how that person lived, and I think I will form a consensus with experiences similar to mine."
12154,203,0,30,INFJ,34,"<Yes>  I'm not good at making decisions and I'm the type to think about it until the end. The reason is that I want to do better, so I think about the repeated worries until the end while running the simulation."
12155,203,0,30,INFJ,35,<neutrality>  It may be repeated from time to time. I think it's because I choose carefully because I have the responsibility for the decision.
12156,203,0,30,INFJ,36,<no>  It is important to enjoy alone time. Being with people makes me more tired.
12157,203,0,30,INFJ,37,"<Yes>  Looking at the work, I think about the intention of the artist and try to imagine more of my own."
12158,203,0,30,INFJ,38,<no>  I enjoy understanding people's emotions. So watch a lot.
12159,203,0,30,INFJ,39,"<neutrality>  The plan is simple to set up. If there are too many, you will be stressed because you cannot keep them, and if there are too many, you will become lazy."
12160,203,0,30,INFJ,40,<no>  I always feel anxious when I think about the future. It seems to be my inclination. I think it's my tendency to worry and worry all the time and then switch to other worries.
12161,203,0,30,INFJ,41,"<no>  If you do it through text, you don't understand people's feelings well and it seems that there are many cases where the delivery is wrong. So I prefer to call."
12162,203,0,30,INFJ,42,"<Yes> Other people may be right, so ask why they think that way."
12163,203,0,30,INFJ,43,"<no>  Better to be alone than with friends. But when I call, I can't refuse and leave."
12164,203,0,30,INFJ,44,"<Yes>  I think that what I have planned must be completed and moved on. The planned work has been delayed due to urgent work, but I plan again and finish the missed work and move on."
12165,203,0,30,INFJ,45,"<Yes> There are times when you suddenly think of something from a few years ago and regret it. There was a time when I made a mistake, and when I go back to that time, I imagine that I would have said something like this."
12166,203,0,30,INFJ,46,"<no>  It seems that I have always been concerned about human existence. People are similar, but no one is the same. It's amazing how different people can live together."
12167,203,0,30,INFJ,47,"<no>  I am good at controlling my emotions. Around me, I am an unknown person. Because they don't show their emotions well."
12168,203,0,30,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  Even though what I did was right, if the other person didn't acknowledge it, I would rather lose. Because that way there won't be any conflict. It is foolish to risk one's life for nothing."
12181,204,1,30,ESFP,1,"<no>  I don't make new friends regularly. But when I get a chance to meet new people, I tend to build close relationships with them."
12182,204,1,30,ESFP,2,"<neutrality>  I don't spend a lot of time exploring various interests, but I do spend time on them in my free time. These days, I tend to be interested in economics."
12183,204,1,30,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  When I see someone else crying, my heart hurts and I empathize with them, but I try to control myself and try to comfort them rationally."
12184,204,1,30,ESFP,4,"<neutrality>  I tend to make several preparations for important things, but I do not make many preparations for everything in my daily life. It seems that they are preparing for it because if something important goes wrong, they will have to repeat it several times."
12185,204,1,30,ESFP,5,"<Yes> Although he has an emotional side, he tries to maintain his composure when the pressure is severe. I was studying for a computer license, but there was a lot of pressure because I wanted to get into the first place, but I kept my composure and studied, and I experienced being stuck in the first place."
12186,204,1,30,ESFP,6,"<neutrality>  Before COVID-19, I tended to introduce myself to new people first, but after COVID-19, I tend to talk to people I already know rather than approach new people. But I like to introduce myself to new people first."
12187,204,1,30,ESFP,7,"<Yes>  After I finish one thing, I tend to start another right away."
12188,204,1,30,ESFP,8,"<neutrality>  Although there is a sentimental side, I chose neutral because I tend to recover quickly."
12189,204,1,30,ESFP,9,"<no>  I tend not to set specific schedules or plans, but only set the big picture. I rarely use diaries or electronic tools."
12190,204,1,30,ESFP,10,"<no> Anyone can make mistakes, so I don't doubt my ability or knowledge with small mistakes."
12191,204,1,30,ESFP,11,<no>  I tend to approach the person I am interested in first and start a conversation. It's not at all difficult to talk to someone you're interested in.
12192,204,1,30,ESFP,12,<Yes>  I don't feel the need to interpret and discuss various works of art.
12193,204,1,30,ESFP,13,"<neutrality> As a child, I tended to follow my emotions a lot, but as an adult, I tend to follow reason. I hear evaluations that are rational from those around me."
12194,204,1,30,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  Even if I plan a schedule for the day, I rarely execute it that way. So I tend to improvise what I want to do."
12195,204,1,30,ESFP,15,<no>  I don't worry about how others see me. I tend to show the way I am.
12196,204,1,30,ESFP,16,"<Yes> Participating in group activities is always fun. But these days, it's a pity that there are many opportunities to do group activities due to corona."
12197,204,1,30,ESFP,17,"<no>  I don't like to read books and I don't deliberately look for movies. In particular, he is less interested in interpreting the ending in his own way."
12198,204,1,30,ESFP,18,"<Yes>  Of course, it's good for me to be successful, but I feel a lot of pride and a sense of accomplishment when I help others succeed and that person is grateful."
12199,204,1,30,ESFP,19,"<no>  I don't have a lot of set interests, and I don't know what to do next. These days, I am interested in the economic part, so I invest in stocks after watching the news or YouTube and storing only the essentials in my head."
12200,204,1,30,ESFP,20,"<neutrality>  I worry about things going wrong, but I tend to think positively. There seems to be no particular occasion or reason."
12201,204,1,30,ESFP,21,"<no>  It's great to take on a leadership role in an organization I love. Since I was an executive during my elementary, middle, high school, and university days, I still seem to enjoy taking on a leadership role."
12202,204,1,30,ESFP,22,"<neutrality>  Since I had a lot of experience in handling various musical instruments as a child, I think I have a yes-seong tendency. However, I think there is little artistic inclination in a field like art."
12203,204,1,30,ESFP,23,"<neutrality>  People are bound to be emotional. However, I think that you can make the right decision only if you try to think with reason."
12204,204,1,30,ESFP,24,"<Yes>  You can rest in peace by finishing your chores before taking a break. After taking a break, there are many cases where I don't want to do housework, so I think it's more comfortable to rest after doing housework."
12205,204,1,30,ESFP,25,<no>  don't think it's fun to watch them argue because they often hurt each other when they argue.
12206,204,1,30,ESFP,26,"<no>  I tend to enjoy the way other people look at me. When I walk around the street, when other people look at me, their gaze is not bad, but rather I like it."
12207,204,1,30,ESFP,27,"<Yes> Even if there is an upset, there are times when you recover quickly and go about your daily life or live with pleasant emotions. For example, even if I get really angry because I had a fight with my husband, the anger quickly subsides and I hardly feel any difficulty in doing other things."
12208,204,1,30,ESFP,28,"<Yes>  I think it is very important to use your time efficiently when doing any task. When I was working, it was frustrating and difficult to understand when I saw my co-workers staying up all night doing something that could be done simply."
12209,204,1,30,ESFP,29,"<Yes> It seems that there are many cases of putting things off until the end. Recently, when packing before going on a trip, I packed everything right before leaving."
12210,204,1,30,ESFP,30,<no>  I don't think the afterlife is that interesting because it's after you die. I think how to live in the present is more important.
12211,204,1,30,ESFP,31,"<Yes>  Being alone seems to be too painful for me. Even these days, I think it's good for my husband or children to come home quickly and have someone to talk to."
12212,204,1,30,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  I was talking with my husband, but he was too boring to talk about theory-centered and principled stories, and it was difficult to focus on the story."
12213,204,1,30,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  I try to empathize on the outside, but it seems difficult to empathize with my heart when the background is completely different. My husband and I have different personalities and different environments, so it is difficult to empathize with him when we talk."
12214,204,1,30,ESFP,34,"<Yes>  When making a decision, I always think about it, and I think I tend to make the decision at the end."
12215,204,1,30,ESFP,35,"<neutrality>  If a decision you've already made is a good one, don't think about it again. However, if it causes wrong results, I tend to think again and try not to have those results next time."
12216,204,1,30,ESFP,36,"<Yes> Spending time alone is so boring. Participating in a party or event gives me a feeling that my life is energized. But these days, it's just too bad that there are too few parties or events due to Corona."
12217,204,1,30,ESFP,37,"<no>  I don't go to art galleries on purpose. Also, it seems that they do not spend time looking for and appreciating works of art."
12218,204,1,30,ESFP,38,"<no>  It's hard to understand the feelings of someone who has a different disposition from mine at first, but I think I can feel that way from that person's point of view."
12219,204,1,30,ESFP,39,"<no>  It seems that I tend to take care of the most important or urgent things of the day first, both at work and personal matters."
12220,204,1,30,ESFP,40,<Yes>  It seems that I live my life almost without feeling any anxiety. I think it's a natural tendency because it seems like it's been like that since I was a child.
12221,204,1,30,ESFP,41,"<no>  I love talking on the phone with friends and close acquaintances. It's fun when we talk, so it seems like we don't even notice the passing of time."
12222,204,1,30,ESFP,42,<no>  I don't seem to spend much time trying to understand someone who disagrees very much with me. I don't want to take the time to talk to someone who disagrees with me because it's tiring.
12223,204,1,30,ESFP,43,"<Yes>  It seems that I always contact my friends to meet up first. In particular, I seem to contact my favorite friends even more first."
12224,204,1,30,ESFP,44,"<no>  It seems that the plan itself is difficult to keep as it is, so I don't think I'm going to go back to the plan quickly if there is a setback."
12225,204,1,30,ESFP,45,"<neutrality>  seem to regret it when I'm stressed over a mistake I made a long time ago. There are times when I regret it, thinking, ¡°Is it a mistake to have chosen my husband as my marriage partner because my personality doesn¡¯t match?¡±"
12226,204,1,30,ESFP,46,<Yes>  It's because I think it's better to live happily every day while thinking deeply about human existence and the reason for living.
12227,204,1,30,ESFP,47,"<no>  tend to try to control my emotions. The older I get, the more I try to control my emotions, and I don't seem to hear much about people around me saying I'm emotional because I used to avoid them."
12228,204,1,30,ESFP,48,"<no>  I tend to tell the other person that the other person's fault is exactly their fault. However, I try to talk in a good way so as not to hurt the other person's feelings."
12241,205,1,40,ISTP,1,"<neutrality> Personally, I don't like making new friends, but I make them periodically out of necessity. For example, there are meetings within the apartment complex or meetings for children's friendship."
12242,205,1,40,ISTP,2,"<neutrality>  I do not continue to explore various fields, but I often look for information in the field of interest and focus on that field."
12243,205,1,40,ISTP,3,"<no> I've never wanted to cry over someone else's crying unless I'm crying over the same subject. When someone else is crying, I'm rather curious about why that person is crying and want to help them solve it."
12244,205,1,40,ISTP,4,"<neutrality>  I thoroughly depend on my importance. I try to make preparations for things that I am not interested in or that are of low importance, such as the warning to solve them at that time, or for things that are (very) important to me."
12245,205,1,40,ISTP,5,"<Yes>  I think pressure is not helpful for my work because it makes people nervous. I'm rather calm when there's a big deal, and I've never felt particularly pressured lately, but based on my experience in the past, I think that's the case."
12246,205,1,40,ISTP,6,"<Yes> I'm not very interested in new people. If someone comes up and says hello, I'll be happy to say it, but I tend not to come forward, and I enjoy talking to someone I already know."
12247,205,1,40,ISTP,7,"<no>  After finding out about doing a part-time job at home, I have been working simultaneously through various sites without doing just one thing. Also, other businesses are being prepared at home. It is not the style to focus on one thing and process it after completion."
12248,205,1,40,ISTP,8,"<no>  It's a pity that it's not too sentimental. When a friend says he or she is depressed, rather than empathizing with the depressed feelings, we focus more on why we are depressed and how we can solve the problem."
12249,205,1,40,ISTP,9,"<no>  I don't like making plans. In particular, I don't understand why so many people make bucket lists. Because those plans feel like homework."
12250,205,1,40,ISTP,10,"<no>  I tend to think that mistakes are just mistakes and I don't dwell on them for long. Not long ago, I practiced a lot before an important concert ticketing, but I failed with a small mistake. At the time, I was a bit angry and depressed, but I think there is nothing I can do about it."
12251,205,1,40,ISTP,11,"<neutrality> I'm not the type to be very interested in people, but I sometimes talk to people I need to get close to first."
12252,205,1,40,ISTP,12,"<Yes>  Everyone has a different opinion anyway, so I wonder if we have to talk about it for a long time. After watching a movie, we tend to talk about whether it's fun or not."
12253,205,1,40,ISTP,13,"<Yes>  tried to follow my emotions, but in the end, my rational mind got ahead of me and I judged accordingly. I tend to get compliments from my friends that I am cold-hearted."
12254,205,1,40,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  Only when there is something important, I tend to keep it in my head as if it were happening today. I have a nail salon reservation today, so I thought about that, and after that, I go shopping or spend the day spontaneously."
12255,205,1,40,ISTP,15,"<neutrality>  This part has changed a bit with age. I don't care even now, but I don't think I can change that person's thoughts, so I try not to care. People are less interested in me than I thought, and even if I tried to change that, they couldn't remember it."
12256,205,1,40,ISTP,16,"<no>  I don't like to coordinate the thoughts of a group. Recently, three families went camping, and there were a lot of people, so we had different thoughts on everything from eating to playing, so we were tired."
12257,205,1,40,ISTP,17,"<Yes> I'm not the type to dislike unkind ending styles. I don't want to discuss it with a bunch of people, but I like to find out about the ending myself and get information. Recently, I enjoyed watching a movie called Burning for that reason."
12258,205,1,40,ISTP,18,"<no>  Not only are they not very interested in the success of others, but they do not feel a sense of accomplishment by sympathizing with the work. I am not very interested in other people."
12259,205,1,40,ISTP,19,"<Yes> At first, I was interested in nails and learning, then I became interested in clothes again, so I bought a sewing machine and made clothes and thought about business."
12260,205,1,40,ISTP,20,"<no>  My husband is the type of person who worries a lot, so I spend my days thinking that I am very frustrated inside. I am a person who thinks that worrying is the most useless thing, so I rarely worry or regret unless it is for preparation."
12261,205,1,40,ISTP,21,"<neutrality>  I don't really want to take on the role, but when I do, I tend to do it happily. I thought I hated attention, but when I took on the role of a leader that drew attention, I felt my own joy."
12262,205,1,40,ISTP,22,"<no>  consider myself to be imaginative and have good ideas. When I was in school, many of the design works I submitted as assignments were praised by my professors, and later, I saw many times that the designs I thought of came out as other designer products that looked like magazines."
12263,205,1,40,ISTP,23,"<no>  think reason is important, but I think that a world where emotions are excluded would be a more difficult and painful world for difficult people. In society articles, I have seen cases where a woman stabbed a man in defense, but the woman was punished. I think there are too many things that the weak will suffer if the punishment is done only rationally."
12264,205,1,40,ISTP,24,"<neutrality>  In my head, I want to finish the housework first, but I tend to think that it's one now, one later anyway, so I finish the housework after taking a break."
12265,205,1,40,ISTP,25,"<Yes>  It's not that I'm arguing, it's fun to watch. When me and two other friends are having a war of nerves, it's fun to read the subtle changes in their emotions or their inner thoughts."
12266,205,1,40,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  They don't like to engage in unnecessary conversation, so they don't want to attract attention unless they have a close group of friends."
12267,205,1,40,ISTP,27,"<neutrality> Emotions tend to change a bit, but not quickly. I have a temper, so I try to keep it calm."
12268,205,1,40,ISTP,28,"<Yes>  I tend to think efficiency is important, so I feel very frustrated. When I go to work and get off work, if I leave now, I can take the subway that comes right away, but I feel very annoyed when other employees who leave work with me are talking about personal jokes or conversations that I don't have to do right now."
12269,205,1,40,ISTP,29,"<Yes>  I tend to do what I want to do quickly, but when it comes to what I have to do, I always feel like homework, so I don't like doing it. So it's a bit of a procrastination style. A neighbor told me a month ago that it would be good to install a filter because some rust water was mixed in the apartment water supply, and even recommended a product."
12270,205,1,40,ISTP,30,"<neutrality>  It's not that I'm not interested, but I don't want to know very deeply or find it very interesting."
12271,205,1,40,ISTP,31,"<neutrality>  I usually like and enjoy spending time alone at home, but when the weather is nice, meeting someone outside for a cup of coffee relieves stress and makes me feel better."
12272,205,1,40,ISTP,32,<no> It seems that I am more interested in the principled story. Conversation like catching floating clouds with futility is boring and frustrating. There are times when you look ignorant when you see someone talking without a basis.
12273,205,1,40,ISTP,33,"<Yes>  Regardless of my background, I tend to try to understand that that person is like that because each person has a different environment and different thoughts. Of course, I don't understand my standards, but I agree that it can be."
12274,205,1,40,ISTP,34,"<no> Because of my impatient nature, I feel a bit frustrated when I put off making a decision. There are times when I make mistakes by making decisions first, but I don't procrastinate."
12275,205,1,40,ISTP,35,"<Yes>  It's the style that considers worries and regrets the most useless, so I don't think about them again. Even if the decision is wrong, I think it can't be helped."
12276,205,1,40,ISTP,36,"<neutrality> To put it bluntly, I prefer to spend time alone, but I don't hate a good party with a group of people. I don't feel very lonely by myself, but I feel like my stress is relieved thinking that it was fun to play with loud music and many people."
12277,205,1,40,ISTP,37,"<no>  I don't like it very much. I don't like the feeling that I have to interpret something while looking at enigmatic paintings or works of art. Just look at it, it's pretty, it's cool, that's about it."
12278,205,1,40,ISTP,38,"<neutrality>  There aren't many, but there are. Someone close to me recently said burnout came, but I don't understand. By my standards, I have a decent family and a stable job, but I wonder why such symptoms appear and whether I am digging a grave by myself."
12279,205,1,40,ISTP,39,"<no> There are things I shouldn't forget, so I remember that as a big category, but I don't like planning. Going according to plan is stressful in itself."
12280,205,1,40,ISTP,40,"<Yes>  That's the natural tendency. I have rarely felt that feeling because I believe that if I feel anxious, I just have to find a way to solve it."
12281,205,1,40,ISTP,41,"<Yes>  hate idle calls. When the other person's words get longer, you keep watching the time. I'm thinking of when to end this phone call at the right time."
12282,205,1,40,ISTP,42,"<no>  People all have different ideas, so I won't take my time to understand them. There are times when I get annoyed by disagreements and get angry, but I'm not the type to try to understand."
12283,205,1,40,ISTP,43,"<no> I've never contacted you to meet first in my life so far. If you ask to meet, I will try to meet you as long as I have time, but I do not hesitate to contact you first."
12284,205,1,40,ISTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in my plan, I try to do it in the best way possible, but when that doesn't work, I tend to give up without bothering to go back. I had to go down to the province because I had an important schedule, but I had another more important schedule that day, so I postponed my previous appointment."
12285,205,1,40,ISTP,45,"<no>  I've thought about what it would have been like if I had done that, but I don't regret it or dwell on it over and over again. I tend to think of it as a waste of my emotions."
12286,205,1,40,ISTP,46,"<Yes>  I don't know why I have to think that way. I think that such thoughts do not help my life, and if I cannot find the reason for my existence, I will not live. I do not understand why I have such thoughts."
12287,205,1,40,ISTP,47,"<Yes>  I tend to try not to be like that, but when I see someone who disagrees with me or is frustrated, my emotions come up and I often show off. People around me tend to evaluate him as having a temper."
12288,205,1,40,ISTP,48,"<no> The mistake is obvious, but I can't just go over it. Depending on the relationship, there are times when you appeal strongly, and there are times when you turn around and point out mistakes. I thought that otherwise he would not be aware of his error."
12301,206,1,40,ENFJ,1,"<Yes>  When I change jobs, I meet new people. The reason is because I usually spend a lot of time with people I meet through work."
12302,206,1,40,ENFJ,2,<Yes> I'm very interested in web novels these days. The reason is that I am interested in creating web novels because I like to read typefaces and want to get a new job.
12303,206,1,40,ENFJ,3,"<Yes>  I tend to empathize a lot. The reason is that when you see someone crying, you wonder why they are crying, and sometimes you ask about the situation."
12304,206,1,40,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  tend to make several preparations. Due to the nature of my job, I have to take responsibility for mistakes at work, so I tend to set up several countermeasures."
12305,206,1,40,ENFJ,5,"<no>  I don't think so. The reason is that I try to be neutral and try to keep my composure, but it doesn't seem to work. Especially in the case of experiencing things for the first time, I try to keep my composure, but I don't think it's because there are many cases where things don't go well."
12306,206,1,40,ENFJ,6,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason is that you think you are behaving differently depending on the situation. If there are a lot of people you already know at the event, you might want to talk to the people you know, but if there are a lot of new people, introduce yourself to the new people first if necessary."
12307,206,1,40,ENFJ,7,<Yes>  tend to finish one project and then start another. The reason is because the thought of doing well at least is nestled in your head.
12308,206,1,40,ENFJ,8,<Yes>  I am sentimental. The reason is that there were many cases in which emotional conclusions were reached when looking back later on in judging the situation.
12309,206,1,40,ENFJ,9,"<no>  like to make plans with a schedule or list. The reason is that there are many cases in which the plans that I have made in my head are quickly forgotten and changed, so I tend to like doing a lot of writing down specific plans."
12310,206,1,40,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  tend to doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. The reason is because I don't want to make mistakes in conversation with others, and I hate being pointed out by colleagues or others when I'm doing my job, so I tend to doubt my ability and check it repeatedly."
12311,206,1,40,ENFJ,11,<Yes> It's not difficult for me to approach and strike up a conversation with someone I'm interested in. The reason is that there are many things to say to those who are interested. You start a conversation because you are curious about him and want to get to know him and get to know him.
12312,206,1,40,ENFJ,12,"<neutrality>  am not very interested in discussing the different interpretations of works of art. The reason is that various interpretations of a work vary according to the emotions and knowledge felt by the viewer for each work, so I have the idea that it is natural and I do not think it is necessary to even discuss it."
12313,206,1,40,ENFJ,13,"<neutrality>  consider myself neutral. The reason is that I know that I am an emotional person and have had many misjudgment experiences. That's why I'm on the side of pursuing to control myself who follows my emotions first and follow my reason. However, there are many perspectives that view me as being on the side of following my emotions."
12314,206,1,40,ENFJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan my day. It's because it's comfortable to set a schedule, take care of the must-do things first, and have a leisurely time."

12316,206,1,40,ENFJ,16,"<neutrality>  tend to be neutral about participating in group activities. Because I get lonely a lot, I like belonging to a group, but I also feel uncomfortable not being able to make other plans due to the restriction of free time due to group activities."
12317,206,1,40,ENFJ,17,"<Yes>  love books and movies with endings that you can interpret in your own way. In the ending part of the drama 'Crash Landing on You', the male and female protagonists of South and North Korea meet once a year in Switzerland, raising questions about whether they got married, whether they were ordinary lovers, or whether they remained friends. no see."
12318,206,1,40,ENFJ,18,<Yes>  I find great satisfaction in helping others succeed. The reason is because seeing the other person's happy face is fun and happy.
12319,206,1,40,ENFJ,19,"<neutrality>  I have a lot of interests and sometimes I don't know what to do next, sometimes I don't. When you get a certain inspiration and your interest suddenly increases, there are times when you don't know what to do, but there are times when you focus on one thing because you have an interest."
12320,206,1,40,ENFJ,20,"<Yes>  tend to worry often. I often worry that things will go wrong because the scars of past failures pile up, and I tend to think about the worst situation in advance."
12321,206,1,40,ENFJ,21,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid taking on a leadership role. If you do well, you will be criticized, and if you do not do well, you will be criticized."
12322,206,1,40,ENFJ,22,<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. This is because he has a keen sensitivity and has grown up receiving praise for his prominence in various fields of art.
12323,206,1,40,ENFJ,23,"<neutrality>  I consider myself neutral. This is because we believe that in order to create a better world, people's emotions and reason must be in harmony so that all fields can grow evenly."
12324,206,1,40,ENFJ,24,"<no>  don't think you have to finish chores in order to relax. When I think I need a break, I don't feel like I have to finish my chores because it's more important for me to rest myself than the situation around me."
12325,206,1,40,ENFJ,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. It is natural for different people to have different thoughts in their life circumstances, and I think that a debate based on opinions is a good opportunity to hear people's thoughts."
12326,206,1,40,ENFJ,26,"<neutrality>  I tend to make an effort to get other people's attention, and sometimes I don't. They make loud noises and show excessive kindness to attract attention to people or situations they like, but they tend to pay attention to their breathing to avoid attracting attention in unwanted situations, so I think they are neutral."
12327,206,1,40,ENFJ,27,"<Yes>  My emotions change quickly. When I am at work, even if I get angry in a situation where I am angry, I cannot get angry in front of other people and I have to control my emotions quickly, so my emotions often change quickly because I repeat it."
12328,206,1,40,ENFJ,28,"<neutrality>  consider myself neutral. The reason is that when I see someone who is not efficient when I can afford it, I don't get annoyed because I understand and sympathize with that person's situation, but when I see someone who is not efficient when I can't afford it, I get annoyed. ."
12329,206,1,40,ENFJ,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. When I think of the last final exam I crammed in while thinking, 'Let's study for the exam in advance', I often put off things I have to do."
12330,206,1,40,ENFJ,30,<no>  I am not interested in questions about the afterlife. The reason is the fear of death.
12331,206,1,40,ENFJ,31,"<Yes>  I like to spend time with other people. It's because I get lonely a lot, but these days, I think about it a lot more."
12332,206,1,40,ENFJ,32,"<Yes>  think original stories are boring. This is because discussions based on theory feel outdated and not essential in a rapidly changing world. Especially in discussions of economic theory, the theory feels difficult and doesn't feel right."
12333,206,1,40,ENFJ,33,"<Yes>  can easily empathize with others. The reason is because most of the emotions people feel are similar and they live thinking that their thoughts are also similar. It's because it's easy to relate to rich people who are hungry, yearn for parental love, and dream of living with loved ones."
12334,206,1,40,ENFJ,34,"<no>  I'm not one to put off making decisions until the end. Even if I think a lot and make a decision, I tend to come to a conclusion with my first thought, so I have to be careful, but I don't think there is a need to postpone it until the end."
12335,206,1,40,ENFJ,35,"<neutrality>  I may or may not rethink the decisions I have already made. In the case of irreversible decisions, I tend not to think about them because they cannot be reversed, but in the case of decisions that can be changed, I tend to think about them because I constantly think over whether or not I made a good decision."
12336,206,1,40,ENFJ,36,"<no>  I tend to relieve fatigue by spending time alone. When my body is tired or mentally exhausted, I tend to spend time alone by bruising, watching movies, or sleeping."
12337,206,1,40,ENFJ,37,"<Yes>  I like going to art galleries. This is because you can get artistic inspiration through the process of making the work, the background of the times, and the thoughts of the artist while appreciating the work of art."
12338,206,1,40,ENFJ,38,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I have a hard time understanding other people's feelings and sometimes I don't. It is not difficult to understand the emotions of colleagues or family members who do the same job, but when a misunderstanding occurs or when dealing with someone who expresses an opinion that you have never even imagined, I think it is difficult to understand the emotions ahead of embarrassment."
12339,206,1,40,ENFJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos. If you specifically write down what you need to do the next day and do it in advance, you will feel that you have lived a good day, and you will be able to use your time in a planned way."
12340,206,1,40,ENFJ,40,"<no>  often feel insecure. This is because I have a sensitive innate tendency, and I often think that unexpected variables will come out of nowhere and interfere with my life."
12341,206,1,40,ENFJ,41,<no>  I don't want to avoid making phone calls. I don't want to avoid it because I love meeting and talking to people.
12342,206,1,40,ENFJ,42,"<neutrality>  may or may not take the time to understand opinions that are very different from mine. If you feel that you don't like it emotionally, you don't make an effort to understand it, but you want to sympathize with other opinions of people you like, why did you come to think that way? I spend a lot of time listening to others' opinions or trying to understand myself."
12343,206,1,40,ENFJ,43,"<Yes>  tend to contact my friends to meet up first. I tend to get lonely a lot, and I actively want to get close to people and get closer to them, so I tend to contact them first."
12344,206,1,40,ENFJ,44,"<no>  If my plan goes wrong, I don't try to get back to it as quickly as possible. Because we believe we can change or amend our plans to suit any given situation."
12345,206,1,40,ENFJ,45,"<Yes>  often regret mistakes made long ago. Looking back, it was a situation that was an opportunity, but it is because I think that my life was turned upside down through mistakes."
12346,206,1,40,ENFJ,46,"<neutrality>  I think deeply about the existence of human beings and the reason for living, and sometimes I don't. This is because once you start thinking, endless questions and concerns arise, making your head complicated and inconclusive."
12347,206,1,40,ENFJ,47,<no> I'm not the type to be swayed by emotions. This is because the judgment that it is not a situation that can be solved by acting emotionally comes first.
12348,206,1,40,ENFJ,48,"<neutrality> Even when it's obvious that it's the other person's fault, I sometimes try to save the other person's face, and sometimes I don't. This is because if I first feel that I am unfair, I have to point out the other person's faults to clear my intuition. However, if it is a situation where you don't have to judge the other person's fault, you don't want to be skewered, so you think about the other person's face and try to get over it."
12361,207,1,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  don't bother trying to make new friends because it's comfortable and nice to meet friends I've known for a long time. The reason is that even if you make a new relationship, most of them lose contact in the middle or the relationship does not last long."
12362,207,1,30,ISTJ,2,"<no>  I don't have many interests, and even if I do, I tend to watch movies or dramas on my days off rather than wasting time exploring them."
12363,207,1,30,ISTJ,3,<neutrality> Sometimes I want to cry and sometimes I don't. The reason is because it has to be a limited situation that I have experienced partly or when the situation is sympathetic.
12364,207,1,30,ISTJ,4,"<neutrality>  There are times when I make preparations and there are times when I don't, but even if I don't make preparations, I tend to try to solve them according to the situation. Because most of the cases where you have to make preparations are important things."
12365,207,1,30,ISTJ,5,"<no> Since I am a person who is easily swayed by emotions, maintaining my composure is the most difficult thing for me. When he is stressed while working on something, he is a person who shows through his tone of voice and facial expression."
12366,207,1,30,ISTJ,6,<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I already know rather than making new ones because I value old ones more than new ones.
12367,207,1,30,ISTJ,7,"<Yes> Personally, I can't concentrate well when working on multiple projects at the same time, so I like to focus fully on one project. Even when I went to work, I didn't like doing multiple things at the same time."
12368,207,1,30,ISTJ,8,"<neutrality>  I'm not usually sentimental, but when I watch dramas or movies that resonate with my heart, I get sentimental. The reason is that the situation and emotions of the actors acting are sympathetic."
12369,207,1,30,ISTJ,9,"<neutrality>  There are times when you make a plan with a schedule or list, and there are times when you do not make a plan and deal with the situation according to the situation. The reason why I do it differently depending on the situation is to distinguish between important things and unimportant things. No diaries or electronic tools are used at all."
12370,207,1,30,ISTJ,10,"<no>  Because people think that everyone can make mistakes, they do not doubt their ability or knowledge because of mistakes."
12371,207,1,30,ISTJ,11,"<neutrality>  Most of them try to approach first, but the other person is not interested, but it is not easy to start a conversation with someone who is interested. This is because he is good at catching the other person's mood or expression and is quick-witted."
12372,207,1,30,ISTJ,12,"<no> Discussion is also not my area of interest, as I have either great or no interest in works of art. The reason is that discussing the various interpretations of a work of art is, to me, something only leisurely people can do."
12373,207,1,30,ISTJ,13,"<no>  I am a person who shows my emotions as they are on my face, and everyone around me knows that."
12374,207,1,30,ISTJ,14,"<neutrality>  There are times when I plan a schedule, and there are times when I don't, but in general, rather than planning a schedule, I tend to work according to the situation."
12375,207,1,30,ISTJ,15,"<no>  Personally, I care a lot about the evaluation of others, so I tend to worry a lot about what kind of person I will be seen by others. The reason is that starting a social life early seems to have an impact, and it is because of a personal tendency to not flexibly pass the evaluation of others."
12376,207,1,30,ISTJ,16,"<no>  will go to company group activities that I absolutely have to attend, but if not, I don¡¯t bother to participate. The reason is that it is much better to rest at home alone."
12377,207,1,30,ISTJ,17,"<no>  Even when I watch dramas or movies, I tend to look for the ending in advance, so I don¡¯t watch works with ambiguous endings at all. I enjoyed watching the most recent Seoul Grand Operation movie."
12378,207,1,30,ISTJ,18,<no>  think my own success is more important than helping others succeed. The reason is because I have a selfish mind that thinks that I am more important than others.
12379,207,1,30,ISTJ,19,"<no>  Not a person with a lot of interests. If you look at my life pattern, most of the work, cooking, and cleaning work. It's because I don't like things that have many events in my daily life or that require a lot of energy."
12380,207,1,30,ISTJ,20,<no>  don't worry in advance that things will go wrong because worrying in advance won't make the wrong thing never happen again.
12381,207,1,30,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  I prefer to do what the leader tells me rather than assume a leadership role in a group, so I want to avoid it if possible. The reason is that as a leader, you don't want to take responsibility for any decision."
12382,207,1,30,ISTJ,22,"<Yes> Personally, I think artistic inclinations should be creative. However, I am a person who lacks a lot of creativity, and creating something new is a huge task for me."
12383,207,1,30,ISTJ,23,"<Yes>  Personally, since I am a person who shows all my emotions on my face, there have been many times when that part has become rather poisonous in my social life. So when I see rational people, I think it's great."
12384,207,1,30,ISTJ,24,"<Yes>  tend to finish my chores before starting work or taking a break. The reason is that if there is any housework left over, I continue to care as if there are some tasks left."
12385,207,1,30,ISTJ,25,"<Yes>  I don't like arguing with other people, so the arguing that others do is actually interesting and interesting."
12386,207,1,30,ISTJ,26,"<Yes>  hate to stand out or stand out in a crowd of people, so if possible, I don't take the lead. It is a story that I report and tell about all my school life and company life."
12387,207,1,30,ISTJ,27,"<Yes>  I feel like I have an angry button, so when others touch that button, I quickly get annoyed or angry. The reason is that there is an obsession with tidying up and cleaning."
12388,207,1,30,ISTJ,28,"<Yes>  This is because when I am in a situation where I suffer damage because the other person does not do well, I cannot cope with it rationally and become emotional."
12389,207,1,30,ISTJ,29,"<no>  I don't have the tendency to put off what I have to do until the end, but I'm a person who feels comfortable when I first do it quickly and then take the time to check if it went well. I've been living like that ever since I was little."
12390,207,1,30,ISTJ,30,<no> It is more important for me to live well now. I don't want to think ahead of time about the distant future.
12391,207,1,30,ISTJ,31,"<no>  Even if I spend time alone, I never think of it as boring or boring, so I like to spend time alone quietly. When I am at home alone, I have a lot of things to do by myself."
12392,207,1,30,ISTJ,32,"<no> Sometimes I hear stories from my family saying that you give out frustratingly obvious answers, but when I think about it, I also tend to give out principled answers."
12393,207,1,30,ISTJ,33,"<no>  It is not easy to form empathy with others who have lived a different background than mine. I'm not from a wealthy family, so when I see others worrying about immature stories, I distance myself from them."
12394,207,1,30,ISTJ,34,"<Yes> When a situation arises in which I need to purchase something, I tend to search the Internet a lot, make a list, and think about it until the end before making a decision. The reason is because I don't want to regret it because of a hasty decision."
12395,207,1,30,ISTJ,35,"<Yes>  If you think again and the results of the decisions you have already made change, you will think a hundred times, but since that is not the case, I tend not to think again."
12396,207,1,30,ISTJ,36,"<no>  tend to avoid places with a lot of people if possible, so spending time alone is probably the way to get rid of the fatigue of the week. The reason why I don't go to parties or events with a lot of people is because even that is work for me."
12397,207,1,30,ISTJ,37,<no>  I have never been to an art museum in my entire life. Because I think it's a place where leisurely people go.
12398,207,1,30,ISTJ,38,"<neutrality>  can understand the emotions that come out about something I've been through or something I can relate to, but it's often difficult to understand otherwise. For example, when a friend is having an in-depth talk about life."
12399,207,1,30,ISTJ,39,"<no>  As someone with a simple life, I tend to have things to do every day."
12400,207,1,30,ISTJ,40,"<Yes>  There may be innate tendencies, but I think insecurity is an emotion only weak people feel. I am by no means a weak person."
12401,207,1,30,ISTJ,41,"<neutrality>  I don't avoid talking on the phone with people I like and have known for a long time, but I tend to avoid talking on the phone with people I don't. Because I am a person whose emotions come out even in the way I speak, it only hurts my feelings when I talk on the phone with someone I want to avoid talking on the phone with."
12402,207,1,30,ISTJ,42,<no>  don't tend to take the time to understand opinions that are very different from my own. It's because you don't understand because you spend time on things you don't understand.
12403,207,1,30,ISTJ,43,"<neutrality>  There are friends I contact first, and there are friends who contact me first, but I tend to call first and make an appointment with friends I usually don't contact."
12404,207,1,30,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  Sometimes I make a plan, sometimes I don't, but once I've made a plan, I tend to try to implement it. A few months ago, I set up a travel itinerary with my husband and went on a trip to Pocheon, but the time wasn't right, so I only changed the order, but I remember trying to fulfill all the schedules I had set. The reason is that if you can't finish the schedule you set once, you will be left with regret."
12405,207,1,30,ISTJ,45,<no>  I have never regretted a mistake. Everyone thinks that they grow up and live in the world through mistakes.
12406,207,1,30,ISTJ,46,"<Yes>  Since we were born, we live hard. I wonder if there is a reason. I think finding the reason for living and thinking about existence is something only idle people do."
12407,207,1,30,ISTJ,47,"<Yes> He is a person whose emotions are revealed on his face, so he gets angry when he is angry and irritated when he is annoyed. So the family suffers a lot."
12408,207,1,30,ISTJ,48,"<neutrality>  If the other person is important to me or someone I have special affection for, I tend to try to save face, but if the other person is someone I dislike or is not an important person, I tend not to get involved. I guess it's because I'm a selfish person."
12421,208,0,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  I enjoy meeting new friends, but I tend to be more comfortable with existing friends. The reason is that I think it is important to maintain good relationships with existing friends now."
12422,208,0,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  tend to spend a good portion of my free time exploring a variety of interests. I am usually interested in various fields such as society, history, culture, mathematics, and education, but these days, I am especially interested in stretching for a healthy life, such as standing yoga, ballet, modern dance, tanz play, mountain climbing, and surprise ideas or vegans for a healthy family meal. You are interested in recipes and delicious lunch boxes, and on the other hand, you seem to be interested in scholars who have studied weightlessness."
12423,208,0,40,INFJ,3,"<neutrality> If I see someone else crying, I will know the situation that person is in, so I feel a sense of pity in my chest, but I have never felt like I just want to cry even though I don't know what it is. But I usually have a lot of times when I feel the same emotions as others."
12424,208,0,40,INFJ,4,"<neutrality>  I need a plan, but things don't always go as planned, so I tend to come up with 2, 3, and 4 plans. And sometimes, depending on the situation, we proceed without preparing a countermeasure."
12425,208,0,40,INFJ,5,"<Yes>  I tend to be very stressed at times in high-pressure environments, but I tend to maintain my composure without wavering. Since I usually have to be responsible for my work, I tend to persevere and do my job well, even if it is difficult to adapt to the surrounding environment."
12426,208,0,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I already know, although I sometimes introduce myself to new people at parties and events. Getting to know someone new is exciting and exciting, but it's normal to have a comfortable conversation with someone you already know."
12427,208,0,40,INFJ,7,"<neutrality>  I have the experience of starting another project after completely completing one project, and it would be nice if it was one, but usually there were many cases where I had to work on multiple projects at the same time depending on the given circumstances. I think it's best to start another project after finishing one project to some extent."
12428,208,0,40,INFJ,8,"<no>  I have a sentimental side, but I don't think I'm very sentimental. The reason is not always sentimental, but I think it is good to keep a certain distance from people in the world, things, or any subject."
12429,208,0,40,INFJ,9,"<neutrality>  I think the part of making a plan with a schedule or list is important and necessary at times, but usually I choose to be flexible in the process of work. Plans are usually written and managed by paperwork programs or by hand."
12430,208,0,40,INFJ,10,<no>  do not doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. The reason is that I am confident in myself and believe that not only my mistakes but everything related to me will be the foundation for my future.
12431,208,0,40,INFJ,11,"<no>  I tend to approach and talk to people I'm interested in, but it's not easy to start a conversation. The reason is that there is some kind of anticipation, but there is also tension, and sometimes I feel cautious about talking to someone new."
12432,208,0,40,INFJ,12,"<no>  I am very interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. The reason is that I am very interested in the philosophical and mathematical parts that are the basis of art works, and it is very interesting and meaningful to explore the people related to them."
12433,208,0,40,INFJ,13,"<Yes>  tend to follow reason rather than emotion. The reason is because I think it's good to recognize, judge, and treat people in the world, things, or any academic at a certain distance."
12434,208,0,40,INFJ,14,<no>  I tend to plan my day ahead of time rather than improvising and just doing what I want to do.
12435,208,0,40,INFJ,15,"<Yes>  don't worry too much about who I look to other people. The reason is that I just think it's good to be comfortable with people, and I don't think anyone can look good to everyone."
12436,208,0,40,INFJ,16,"<no>  I do not enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is that group activities seem to require some kind of experience or some level of familiarity, and if you make a small mistake, you don't feel comfortable for some reason."
12437,208,0,40,INFJ,17,"<no>  I don't only like books and movies where you can interpret the ending in your own way. The reason seems to be that it is better to just see, sympathize with, and enjoy things as they are rather than interpreting them because they have their own way."
12438,208,0,40,INFJ,18,"<neutrality>  find great satisfaction and joy in helping others succeed, but I'm not sure if I feel that way more than myself. I also had a wish to have a job helping others succeed for a year."
12439,208,0,40,INFJ,19,<no>  I don't think there has ever been a time when I had so many interests that I didn't know what to do next.
12440,208,0,40,INFJ,20,<no>  I don't often worry about things going wrong. The reason is that I have confidence in myself and think that it is important to deal with it well at times and that it is enough to do so.
12441,208,0,40,INFJ,21,"<neutrality>  The role of a leader will not be easy for me, but if given to me, I do not want to avoid it. Still, it seems that there are parts that are comfortable and good in general rather than being a leader."
12442,208,0,40,INFJ,22,"<no>  think I have enough artistic inclinations. The reason is that he is very interested in exploring the philosophical values related to works of art, is interested in creating something original and differentiated, and is meticulous, clear, pure, intuitive, and expressive."
12443,208,0,40,INFJ,23,"<Yes>  I believe that if people valued rationality rather than emotion, they would lead the world and human society more beneficially and righteously, and also make it peaceful."
12444,208,0,40,INFJ,24,"<neutrality>  think housework is considered to be important first, so it would be nice to finish it first before taking a break, but I think there may be times when it is not."
12445,208,0,40,INFJ,25,<no>  I don't think it's fun watching other people's arguments. I have never thought about this question in particular.
12446,208,0,40,INFJ,26,"<neutrality>  usually try not to draw attention to others, but sometimes it seems that others want attention. Although I am an introverted and quiet personality, I don't seem to be particularly on either side of this question."
12447,208,0,40,INFJ,27,"<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly and I seem to be good at controlling my emotions. Even if the surrounding environment or conditions don't suit me, I tend to do my job well without being shaken."
12448,208,0,40,INFJ,28,"<no>  I don't get annoyed with people who aren't as effective as I am. I guess the reason is just my inclination. For example, if I feel that someone is less efficient than I am, I can tell them my way once, or I don't get annoyed because I think I might not understand that person's unique way."
12449,208,0,40,INFJ,29,<no>  I don't put things off until the end. The reason is because I think it's best to do things as planned as possible.
12450,208,0,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes>  think the question of the afterlife is interesting. The reason is that there is an afterlife, and I think that interest in it can give me a chance to look back on myself and suggest what humans should do. Above all, it is because videos and promotional materials related to the afterlife are very interesting."
12451,208,0,40,INFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I'm okay with spending time alone, but sometimes I want to spend time with other people. I seem to be spending a lot of time alone these days. I go hiking on weekends, and I want to be with good people in the future."
12452,208,0,40,INFJ,32,"<no>  I am interested in theory-based discussions and believe that the original story is of great value. Above all, the principled thing will be the basis of reality."
12453,208,0,40,INFJ,33,"<Yes>  I seem to be the type of person who can sympathize with and understand people up close, even if they come from completely different backgrounds."
12454,208,0,40,INFJ,34,"<no>  I tend to make decisions carefully, but I don't put off making them until the last minute."
12455,208,0,40,INFJ,35,"<Yes>  I do not rethink the decisions I have already made, but clearly recognize the decisions I have made and think about how to do well in the future."
12456,208,0,40,INFJ,36,"<neutrality>  I like spending time alone, and I like attending fun parties and events to unwind after a long work week."
12457,208,0,40,INFJ,37,"<Yes>  like going to art galleries, and I am also interested in appreciating works of art and exploring things related to them."
12458,208,0,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  I tend to understand other people's feelings very well. Other people are not like me, so sometimes it is difficult, but thinking about the person's situation and disposition seems to help me understand the feelings."
12459,208,0,40,INFJ,39,"<no>  I tend to spend my time with a plan, but I don't like to plan out my daily to-dos."
12460,208,0,40,INFJ,40,"<Yes>  I don't think I've ever had a bad time. There are times when I feel insecure temporarily in my life, but I think it's more important to have confidence in yourself than to have anxiety."
12461,208,0,40,INFJ,41,<no>  It never occurred to me that I particularly wanted to avoid making phone calls.
12462,208,0,40,INFJ,42,"<no>  don't think I've ever spent much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from my own. Everyone has an opinion, and I think it's important to accept it as it is and coordinate well with each other."
12463,208,0,40,INFJ,43,<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends to meet up first. I think it's good to contact friends first.
12464,208,0,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes> If my plan is disrupted, I try to get back to it as quickly as possible. Since not everything goes according to plan, I think the mindset in the process of work is important."
12465,208,0,40,INFJ,45,"<Yes>  I often regret mistakes made long ago. I often wonder what kind of life I should live. It seems that the flow of time is inevitable, so I think I have a lot of regrets even though they are precious memories left to me."
12466,208,0,40,INFJ,46,<no>  I usually think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. The reason is that the question of how people should live in life seems to be really necessary.
12467,208,0,40,INFJ,47,<no>  I try to control my emotions well without being swayed by my emotions. It seems that there was no special evaluation around.
12468,208,0,40,INFJ,48,"<Yes>  really hate the other person's obvious mistakes, but even so, it's important to save the other person's face, and I try to do that."
12481,209,0,40,INFP,1,"<no>  I never do periodic friend-making. In most cases, it is a chance meeting or a natural meeting that you get to know while working, leading to a friendship. The reason is that I am rarely conscious of the situation of making friends, and I tend to pursue relationships that follow the flow."
12482,209,0,40,INFP,2,"<neutrality>  I'm curious about the field I'm interested in, but I don't spend too much time exploring it. However, if there is a field I am really interested in, I tend to immerse myself in studying it. Recently, I am interested in programming language technology that is good for creative activities or video editing."
12483,209,0,40,INFP,3,"<Yes>  I tend to empathize a lot with the sorrows of others. Even if I am in a good mood, if I am in a situation where I shed tears due to someone else's sadness, I often quickly assimilate into that atmosphere. Usually, when I feel like this, I first think about how I will react if that sad situation that others are experiencing becomes my case."
12484,209,0,40,INFP,4,"<neutrality>  Usually when I plan things, I don't make many preparations for the failure of the result. The reason is because I try to pay more attention to the process for immediate success rather than thinking about countermeasures in case of failure."
12485,209,0,40,INFP,5,"<no> If the pressure is severe, the sensitive reaction is felt first by the body, so if it is not resolved immediately to some extent, it is often affected. Recently, while on the way to attend an important meeting due to official business, there was a case where I had an abdominal pain and delayed the time."
12486,209,0,40,INFP,6,"<Yes> Usually, when I have a big gathering, I tend to join a group of people I know first and act together. The reason is that I am passive and cautious rather than active in human relationships, so I feel comfortable joining a familiar side naturally."
12487,209,0,40,INFP,7,"<neutrality> When I'm working, I tend to enjoy doing several things at the same time. However, I prefer to focus on important tasks or areas of interest first and finish them first. In my personal experience, when I have many things to do, I have many memories of much higher efficiency and less stress when I do things little by little and build up rather than focusing on one thing."
12488,209,0,40,INFP,8,"<neutrality>  When looking at artistic areas or aesthetic parts that require appreciation, we often think that way, but in other parts, we often exclude appreciation and think."
12489,209,0,40,INFP,9,"<no>  When I plan my work, I usually don't plan on a tight schedule. Usually, when planning work, I prefer to draw the overall situation in my head, organize the parts about it in my head, divide it into large chunks, and proceed flexibly and improvised accordingly. I also don't like using tools like Planner."
12490,209,0,40,INFP,10,"<Yes>  I usually don't think that I will make a big mistake or have a problem in the field I'm confident in. However, when mistakes occur in the process, I tend to be very disappointed in myself. Recently, I thought I had a lot of knowledge related to computers, but I remember being confused when I found out that the field I talked about confidently was not the right knowledge."
12491,209,0,40,INFP,11,"<no>  Even if there is a subject I am interested in, I am not the type to actively step forward, so it was often difficult for me to approach it. Usually, it was most of the experience of making a relationship through the people around me if I was really interested in it."
12492,209,0,40,INFP,12,"<neutrality>  Personally, I think it is a natural phenomenon for various opinions to come out about the interpretation of art, and I respect such thoughts. But I'm not really interested in discussing or doing anything like that. So, I am curious about various interpretations and enjoy seeing them, but I do not have the intention of participating greatly in them."
12493,209,0,40,INFP,13,"<neutrality>  think it is very difficult and difficult to accurately separate and judge emotions and reason in any situation. If it is an academic field that can be clearly divided, it can be, but when it is not in such a situation, I feel that most of the cases are complex cases that always consider both, so I try to make appropriate judgments about such situations as much as possible. Acquaintances who know me sometimes say that I am emotional, but in some cases, they say that I am a cool and rational judge."
12494,209,0,40,INFP,14,"<Yes> Excluding passive plans due to external schedules, I tend to act on what I want to do mostly through spontaneous judgment. It's because I feel for myself that there are many cases where even if you make up your mind to do something, the surrounding environment or atmosphere often changes the plan."
12495,209,0,40,INFP,15,"<neutrality>  usually don't pay much attention to how I look to other people, but when I have to show that side of myself or when a situation arises, I tend to think deeply about it and worry about it. Even though I thought I was not worried about the appearance of others, but after going through a situation where that appearance affects the people around me, I felt that I had to think more about the appearance I needed to pay attention to."
12496,209,0,40,INFP,16,"<no>  don't enjoy participating in groups or communities. It's because they don't enjoy being tied down or having to act according to a plan. Even now, I'm still comfortable with personal actions, and I prefer to stay that way."
12497,209,0,40,INFP,17,"<no>  I prefer works of art in which the story flows according to the creator's intention and has a definite ending or number of foreshadowings. Ambiguous endings or fuzzy stories personally make me feel frustrated, so I like things with a definite ending."
12498,209,0,40,INFP,18,"<Yes>  I'm a style that gets very satisfied with the role of a helper. It is because I have experienced that when I make up for the lack of others with my knowledge or actions and provide happiness to someone through that, the satisfaction and sense of kinship is greater than I thought, and I have felt that this suits me well."
12499,209,0,40,INFP,19,"<Yes>  am curious about various things and often have a willingness to try them. However, because I am interested in so many different fields, I often have difficulty sorting or prioritizing the order of things. Recently, I've been interested in video editing, but I keep getting confused about what to study first, such as various visual configurations or audio arrangements used in video editing, or various knowledge on how to use the programs I use."
12500,209,0,40,INFP,20,"<neutrality>  have no great fear of failure. However, in case something goes wrong, I think you should always keep in mind a countermeasure or a second-best solution. It's because I had an experience that when I was working on a big project in the past, the fear of failure affected other things to do, so I couldn't even proceed with other things properly and had problems. So worrying is necessary, but excessive worrying is rather bad."
12501,209,0,40,INFP,21,"<Yes>  am not the type to take the initiative in doing things in front of others. Personally, I'm not an active personality, but through experience, I felt that the role of attracting others is not my aptitude. This is because the operation of the club and the evaluation of the people around it were much higher when someone else helped run the club as a helper than when I was in charge of the club while doing club activities when I was a college student a long time ago."
12502,209,0,40,INFP,22,"<no>  When I was a student, I thought I had no artistic inclination at all, but as I got more and more exposed to various fields, my interest in art-related things grew a lot, and I'm trying it out. Now I'm thinking about seriously studying art, music, and writing. I think it is because I came to realize that the field of creation can be more interesting and fun than I thought while experiencing various things."
12503,209,0,40,INFP,23,"<no>  think that rational judgment is very efficient and brings good results for decisions of knowledge or choices that require a reasonable and immediate answer. However, since emotions are one of the fundamental parts that everyone has, if we apply judgments that focus only on reason or exclusion on them to all situations, this basic structure itself in terms of the function of human society in which each other influences and combines each other. I think it would have accelerated the dystopian world faster as it led to the result of denying ."
12504,209,0,40,INFP,24,"<no> When I feel the need for a break, I think an immediate break is best. It's because I've had a lot of feelings that housework or work that I do after being recharged with rest is handled more effectively and effortlessly."
12505,209,0,40,INFP,25,"<no> Personally, I'm not happy with it. I think the review of various processes through debate or the process of increasing knowledge is definitely positive and good, but in the process, I often go through situations that lead to conflicts between the emotional parts of each other, so I'm not very reluctant to watch them."
12506,209,0,40,INFP,26,<Yes>  tend to refrain from actions such as stepping out in front of others or attracting others' attention. It's because I have a lot of bad memories because there are a lot of cases where I get overly nervous or make mistakes when I'm in a situation where attention is focused or I have to be the center.
12507,209,0,40,INFP,27,"<neutrality>  I don't think the change of emotions is very fast or slow. It's just that emotions are slowly transferred according to the situation of the moment, and there are not many situations where you are suddenly happy and then angry, or happy and then depressed."
12508,209,0,40,INFP,28,"<neutrality>  The standard of efficiency that each person feels is different, but when I see people who usually handle things or do things in a different way from the standard of efficiency that I feel, I think that that can be okay, or that it will be a little faster if I do it like me, but that is a little disappointing. It's about. In short, I feel like it doesn't matter too much."
12509,209,0,40,INFP,29,"<Yes>  I do not make a big plan when handling work, so when a long time is given, I tend to take care of other things first or take care of them leisurely. Of course, there are often embarrassing cases due to this, so I'm trying to deal with it in advance as much as possible recently."
12510,209,0,40,INFP,30,"<Yes>  I find the afterlife very interesting. In real life, countless emotions and memories are vividly felt and changed every moment, so you can recognize that you are living on your own. Or I'm very curious if it's moved to something else and continues."
12511,209,0,40,INFP,31,"<no>  I don't like having my schedule impacted by other people's interactions or my priorities being pushed aside. I think it's because I feel the most stable and comfortable to take care of what I have to do and rest while spending it alone as much as possible. Still, these days, I sometimes think that having a little bit of human relationships, even in the minority, would be a little more helpful to the quality of life."
12512,209,0,40,INFP,32,"<no> Discussion based on theory is not boring, but rather a process of building certain knowledge through raising various questions about fundamental knowledge. As one of my personal experiences, I had a discussion about the efficiency of data structures in computer program coding, and the exchange of opinions gave me an opportunity to learn why the study of data structures is important in programming and how it can be used well in computer engineering. ."
12513,209,0,40,INFP,33,"<neutrality>  When I was young, I thought it was difficult to understand and communicate with people from different backgrounds and knowledge. However, as I grew older, became a college student, and experienced various exchanges until I entered society, I often gained new knowledge or insights from people with different backgrounds and knowledge that I could not gain through my experience, so my thoughts changed a lot. ."
12514,209,0,40,INFP,34,"<Yes>  I tend to take the process of making a decision as long as possible and make a decision after thinking about the things that can happen or various situations in the process. I often see cases where hasty decisions lead to bad results, so I feel like this is better."
12515,209,0,40,INFP,35,"<neutrality> As much as possible, I tend not to think about the decisions I have already made, but even if I have made a careful decision about important matters, I often have a second thought about the part that I think might be a problem. I can't help it if it's already been done with a decision, but I think it's helpful just to review it if a little review can spot and correct the mistakes."
12516,209,0,40,INFP,36,"<no>  think the concept of rest is to be quiet, so I always prefer to spend it quietly alone. Whether in the past or now, it is always better to spend this part alone."
12517,209,0,40,INFP,37,"<neutrality>  I don't spend much time artificially appreciating works of art through action. However, I like to appreciate interesting works of art that I come across naturally while reading books or watching videos."
12518,209,0,40,INFP,38,"<neutrality>  Emotions that are revealed on the outside are often easily understood and assimilated, but there are often cases in which we cannot respond at all to sudden changes, unexpected situations, or emotional expressions that are not visible on the surface but are only conveyed through words. I can't catch anything like expressing happiness or sadness with a calm expression."
12519,209,0,40,INFP,39,<no>  I tend not to make plans and act accordingly. I like to increase my personal efficiency by doing things a little more spontaneously according to the situation or environment at the moment.
12520,209,0,40,INFP,40,"<neutrality>  tend to feel a lot of anxiety when I'm dealing with something important and worried that something might go wrong, but in other cases, I don't feel very anxious. It feels like this has always been the case, rather than a particular acquired influence."
12521,209,0,40,INFP,41,"<no>  I don't feel very uncomfortable or anxious about communicating over the phone. Even when I speak face-to-face, I tend to speak naturally unless I am standing in front of the public."
12522,209,0,40,INFP,42,"<no> I'm not the type to try to understand a lot about people who have different opinions than mine. Of course, differences of opinion can occur in any subject and always happen, but when there is a large difference in judgment and opinions on emotional situations rather than understanding rational and objective judgment, I just pass it over. I've rarely experienced a case where it's easily accepted or understood even if I spend a lot of time on it."
12523,209,0,40,INFP,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to call a friend or propose a meeting first. If you contact me first, I will make an appointment after adjusting the schedule accordingly."
12524,209,0,40,INFP,44,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to make plans and get things done. However, when a problem arises after making a plan and proceeding with the schedule, the first thing to do is to revise the plan. I had all the accommodations and schedules set according to the vacation schedule, but I was pushed back due to work problems, so I canceled all the reservations and rescheduled my work and vacation plans."
12525,209,0,40,INFP,45,"<Yes>  At the moments of many choices in life, I often think about what it would have been like if I had been like this. Even now, I'm thinking of choosing carefully so that I don't make a regrettable choice, but it seems that there are many situations where I have to think about making a choice about various financial aspects."
12526,209,0,40,INFP,46,"<no>  It is a question that we often think about the reason for life and existence. When I think about various questions such as the meaning of my existence and the connection between me and society, I realize that there are many interesting parts in life."
12527,209,0,40,INFP,47,"<no> Changes in emotions are common, just like everyone else's, but they don't get you into trouble or complicate things by being wielded by them. I've never had a problem with my emotions ever mentioned to me."
12528,209,0,40,INFP,48,"<neutrality> It depends on the situation, but if it's not a big deal that I can handle more flexibly even if it's the other person's fault, I tend to pay attention to maintaining face. Of course, if a big problem arises due to an immediate mistake, of course, we should clarify the responsibility and take responsibility, but I think it is a better decision from a social point of view to consider the position of the other party depending on the degree of the issue."
12541,210,1,30,ENTJ,1,"<Yes>  Rather than trying to make one, it seems that you naturally make friends when you have a conversation, such as when you participate in a new job or meeting. However, the number of occurrences seems to decrease markedly with age."
12542,210,1,30,ENTJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, it seems like he spends his time exploring about starting a YouTube channel and various hobbies."
12543,210,1,30,ENTJ,3,"<neutrality>  I think it was like that a lot when I was young, but as I got older, it seems to have decreased because I felt that plain consolation was more powerful than crying together. It seems that there are often cases where there is not much sympathy."
12544,210,1,30,ENTJ,4,"<Yes>  Since I had an embarrassing experience when I tried without any countermeasures, I think I think about what to do if something goes wrong rather than making a plan."
12545,210,1,30,ENTJ,5,"<Yes>  had to give a lecture, but when I asked a question I didn't know, I felt a lot of pressure. I tried my best to prepare for the lecture, but at the last minute, I put it down a little more and thought, 'But I know more than you guys' and worked comfortably."
12546,210,1,30,ENTJ,6,"<Yes>  If you already know someone, of course you'd be comfortable talking to them first, but if you don't know anyone, you can introduce yourself to someone new."
12547,210,1,30,ENTJ,7,"<Yes> When multiple projects overlap, I work as much as possible within the limit that I can control, but if the deadline is delayed due to failure to control, there is a problem of trust, and I also have a very difficult experience."
12548,210,1,30,ENTJ,8,"<neutrality>  To some extent, it is sentimental, but I think it can change depending on the situation because there are many things to think about realistically."
12549,210,1,30,ENTJ,9,"<Yes>  I might have forgotten something, so I tend to make a plan and use a calendar app to coordinate my schedule so that they don't overlap."
12550,210,1,30,ENTJ,10,"<no>  I think people can make mistakes to some extent, and I always work with a learning attitude, so I don't doubt it too much."
12551,210,1,30,ENTJ,11,"<Yes>  I don't talk openly, but I don't think it's difficult. You can look it up, see it, and then talk to it."
12552,210,1,30,ENTJ,12,<no> It seems that various interpretations are interesting and also an opportunity to learn about facts that you did not know. It's interesting to hear about opinions that differ from mine.
12553,210,1,30,ENTJ,13,"<Yes>  Usually, I tend to follow reason, but when I have a difficult decision to make, I look back on my emotions and in the end, I tend to follow my emotions. The evaluations around it seem to be similar."
12554,210,1,30,ENTJ,14,"<no> Having a plan for the day puts my mind at ease. However, they often do not hesitate to improvise."
12555,210,1,30,ENTJ,15,"<no>  I don't know how things will turn out for people, so I want to be seen as a good image to others. That doesn't mean I don't care about what other people think."
12556,210,1,30,ENTJ,16,"<neutrality>  Participating in group activities is good and enjoyable as it is, but these days, it seems that people do not bother to find and create activities."
12557,210,1,30,ENTJ,17,"<no>  It's good to interpret and discuss in your own way, but it's better to have a definite ending."
12558,210,1,30,ENTJ,18,"<neutrality>  I like the success of others, but I think my own success is important. I think it's better to find a way to succeed together."
12559,210,1,30,ENTJ,19,"<Yes>  have a lot of interests and a lot of things I want to do, so I don't know what to do next. Recently, I became interested in calligraphy and wanted to learn it, and then I became interested in data labeling and participated in this way."
12560,210,1,30,ENTJ,20,"<no>  Not much to worry about. I tend to always think of the next best thing, but I think it's better to correct it quickly than to regret it because something went wrong."
12561,210,1,30,ENTJ,21,"<no> If you take on a leadership role in a group, there will be a reason for taking it. You'll get stressed out, but you won't avoid it."
12562,210,1,30,ENTJ,22,"<no>  I think you definitely have an artistic inclination. I've been doing art since I was young, and I've worked continuously in the design industry and I think it's a good fit."
12563,210,1,30,ENTJ,23,"<Yes> There are too many things happening that don't make sense to common sense. I think it would be a better world if at least common sense was followed, but I also think that not being like that is another way of living."
12564,210,1,30,ENTJ,24,"<Yes>  It's something I have to do someday, but if I put it off, I keep being pushed back, and if I take a break, I hate doing it more. So, whenever possible, I try to finish the housework first."
12565,210,1,30,ENTJ,25,"<neutrality>  It's fun if it's not a big argument, but if it's between people I know, I hate it because it's uncomfortable."
12566,210,1,30,ENTJ,26,"<neutrality>  It's not like I'm trying to attract attention. Depending on the situation, there are times when I go out in front of people and there are times when I don't."
12567,210,1,30,ENTJ,27,"<no>  When I was young, I tended to express my emotions as they were, but I went through uncomfortable situations because of that, and as I got older, I think I was able to control my emotions to some extent."
12568,210,1,30,ENTJ,28,"<Yes> It's a world where everything comes out with just one search, but it's frustrating to see people asking unconditionally."
12569,210,1,30,ENTJ,29,"<no>  It's not something that can be solved by procrastinating, so I tend to try to get rid of things I don't want to do more quickly than to keep feeling uncomfortable."
12570,210,1,30,ENTJ,30,<no>  I wonder if there really is an afterlife. I don't think too much about it for long because it's about the end of it if I just die.
12571,210,1,30,ENTJ,31,"<Yes> Spending a good time with others is more fun and memorable. These days, though, I seem to be learning how to play alone."
12572,210,1,30,ENTJ,32,"<no>  I am also interested in theory-oriented discussions. When a topic comes up, it's fun to talk to people who have different opinions about it and hear different opinions and interpretations."
12573,210,1,30,ENTJ,33,"<neutrality> It's hard to sympathize easily, but I try my best to understand. Because everyone has lived with different experiences, it is not easy to say that they sympathize with each other."
12574,210,1,30,ENTJ,34,"<no>  It depends, but most of the time I tend to make quick decisions. It seems that it is not common for things to change over a long period of time."
12575,210,1,30,ENTJ,35,"<Yes>  I try not to regret the decision I have already made, thinking that I would have made the same choice even if I could go back in time and go back to the time when I made that decision."
12576,210,1,30,ENTJ,36,"<Yes>  On weekends, I usually spend time with my boyfriend or friends, going out to eat delicious food or going on a trip."
12577,210,1,30,ENTJ,37,"<Yes>  I like. I think it's good to think about what the person who drew it while working, get ideas, and look at it a lot to broaden your knowledge."
12578,210,1,30,ENTJ,38,"<no>  I can't say I understand everything if that person's situation is not the same, but if I think about how hard it would be if that situation happened to me, I often understand my feelings."
12579,210,1,30,ENTJ,39,"<Yes>  If you plan a schedule for work or personal matters, you will feel proud when you stick to the plan."
12580,210,1,30,ENTJ,40,"<neutrality>  don't feel anxious thanks to my innate tendency to think positively, but I don't think it's strange that I feel anxious when I think about the future."
12581,210,1,30,ENTJ,41,"<no>  It's nice to be able to check again to see if there's anything I've missed when I leave business content via messenger, etc., but I don't hate phone calls."
12582,210,1,30,ENTJ,42,"<no>  want to understand that other people can think like this. And since there are many cases that are understood through conversation, it seems that they do not spend much time."
12583,210,1,30,ENTJ,43,"<Yes>  If you would like to see it, do not hesitate to contact us first. It seems that there are many cases that are delayed after only measuring each other's timing, so it seems that I am the type to contact and decide first."
12584,210,1,30,ENTJ,44,"<Yes> If the project schedule is disrupted, we try to meet the delivery date as much as possible. But if you're looking for a better way, I think it's one way to turn."
12585,210,1,30,ENTJ,45,"<no>  It is a caution not to regret the past choices. Even if I respect my choice at the time and go back, I think I would have made the same choice."
12586,210,1,30,ENTJ,46,"<neutrality> Usually I don't think too deeply, but sometimes my thoughts do. In the end, I feel like I am alone, and I feel like I am an existence that I have to live with, but I am not sure yet."
12587,210,1,30,ENTJ,47,"<no>  Since I was not the type to control my emotions when I was young, I practiced a lot in controlling my emotions."
12588,210,1,30,ENTJ,48,"<no>  I hate it when you don't admit you're wrong. I don't give face-to-face, but I don't think I'm trying to save face."
12601,211,0,40,INFJ,1,"<no>  Interpersonal relationships are burdensome. I don't make good relationships outside of my family. I had a lot of bad experiences when I made friends hastily. Old relationships have also had many disappointing experiences, so they refrain from making new friends."
12602,211,0,40,INFJ,2,"<Yes>  I like historical and mythological stories, so whenever I have time, I tend to look for related materials. These days, YouTube is often used."
12603,211,0,40,INFJ,3,"<Yes>  Momentarily weep and become depressed. It is a feeling that emotions are transferred when others are sad. The same is true when listening to sad songs. So, avoid sad songs as much as possible. Because there is nothing good about staying depressed."
12604,211,0,40,INFJ,4,"<Yes> Throughout my life, I felt that I shouldn't prepare for just one case. Even in my heart, I keep variables in mind. It is because there are many cases of failure because they do not prepare for the number of cases. There were cases where mistakes or incidents occurred in unexpected places and ruined work. It might not have been ruined with a little preparation and preparation."
12605,211,0,40,INFJ,5,"<no>  wasn¡¯t the type to endure well when I was in a stressful environment and under pressure. I experienced severe stress that caused severe headaches and muscle pain beyond mental fatigue. After that, I tend to avoid stressful environments and work. In particular, the stress was severe when others insulted her personality and reprimanded and pressured her. Compared to the tiring and difficult work, the burden on the mind and body was less."
12606,211,0,40,INFJ,6,"<Yes>  It is burdensome to meet new people. Also, if you don't talk often with people you already know, you tend to talk more often with people you already know because it gives the impression of neglect."
12607,211,0,40,INFJ,7,"<Yes>  If you care about multiple projects, you get distracted and ruin the work. When you are immersed in one thing, it's good to cool your head and focus on work again. So, I tend to start another project after I completely finish one project."
12608,211,0,40,INFJ,8,"<neutrality>  My heart is moved when I see moving movies or music, but I am usually a bit cold-hearted, so I am not that sentimental."
12609,211,0,40,INFJ,9,<Yes>  I like to manage my schedule mainly with Google Calendar. Organizing your schedule like that gives you peace of mind. I feel at ease. I also use my smartphone alarm often.
12610,211,0,40,INFJ,10,"<Yes>  gave up on a mission that wasn't that difficult while playing a game these days. Now I felt I was too old to do this. When I was younger, I didn't doubt myself, but now that I'm older, when I make a small mistake or a result that falls short of my goal, I get discouraged rather than challenged."
12611,211,0,40,INFJ,11,"<Yes> Conversation or socializing with strangers began to feel burdensome. Even when it was absolutely necessary, he often hesitated and pondered. The same goes for people who have a lot of likes. It feels really difficult. As we get older, we avoid interpersonal relationships, which makes socializing more difficult and awkward."
12612,211,0,40,INFJ,12,<no>  I am particularly interested in sculptures and oil paintings. I like stories and discussions about the history and artists behind those works of art. I often looked for related videos and even discussed them with my acquaintances when I was in school.
12613,211,0,40,INFJ,13,"<neutrality>  I want to act rationally, but looking back on my actions, there were many cases where I acted irrationally because I was dominated by my emotions. As a result, people around me are often cold-hearted when they evaluate me, but I am concerned that there are times when I act emotionally. This part is being corrected as I get older, because I observe and reflect on my behavior through self-reflection several times a day."
12614,211,0,40,INFJ,14,"<neutrality>  Plan and execute the day's work. However, for more than half of the day, I tend to spontaneously adjust my behavior depending on my condition. I tend to prefer spontaneous actions, but when there is work or something important, I tend to concentrate on it and work as planned."
12615,211,0,40,INFJ,15,"<Yes>  As long as it doesn't harm me, I don't care much about other people's opinions. However, in my social life, I tend to be careful where there are many people's eyes. This is because misunderstandings may arise with my trivial actions and rumors may spread. This is a common occurrence in social life."
12616,211,0,40,INFJ,16,"<neutrality>  I tend to avoid group activities because they often become tiring because interests become complicated. I often do group activities online where relationships are not burdensome. I often meet people in the game community and play games together. However, offline group activities are not conducted for the reasons stated above."
12617,211,0,40,INFJ,17,"<no>  If the story of the work is clear, I think that the so-called open ending is not suitable. I like works with a clear storyline, and I especially like stories with a clear ending. That's why I like Greek mythology and historical works. In that respect, I hate The Wailing, a movie that ends with an open ending, and I like Sabah, a movie with a clear ending."
12618,211,0,40,INFJ,18,<neutrality>  I like listening to other people's concerns and suggesting solutions on the web. I feel joy when the other person successfully overcomes their troubles. I liked the fact that the other person got out of a difficult situation with the knowledge that came from my trial and error and experience. It feels like my pain is gone.
12619,211,0,40,INFJ,19,"<Yes> In my free time, I look up historical stories and Greek mythology. In the meantime, when a desire for various topics such as cooking, animals, and games arises, I often search the Internet for related topics aimlessly."
12620,211,0,40,INFJ,20,"<Yes> It's because there is an experience that things that went smoothly in the past have been ruined by unexpected things. After going through that a few times, I didn't let my guard down until it was over. I tend to be anxious until the work is completely finished, but I don't just worry about it. I tend to prepare for contingency by conducting several midterm inspections to prevent mistakes in advance and preparing extra data. This prevented any disruption to work."
12621,211,0,40,INFJ,21,"<Yes>  tend to avoid leadership roles as much as possible. This is because I have often seen members who want to avoid work or those who gather such members and form another faction within the group to slow down or act recklessly. It was often difficult to deal with these people. In this case, the whole project will struggle to reach its goal and ruin the work. Because of those experiences, I tend to avoid leadership roles as much as possible. However, if the members are full of will, I want to take on the role of leader."
12622,211,0,40,INFJ,22,"<neutrality>  don't think my artistic inclination is that great, but I don't think it's completely absent. Although their artistic creation ability is poor, they like to appreciate works of art and try to come into contact with art and cultural media frequently."
12623,211,0,40,INFJ,23,"<neutrality> If only reason was important, I think that children, women, the elderly and the disabled would not have been protected, and the tribe itself would not have flourished as it does now. I've seen related documentaries, and through that, this idea has been solidified. I think the balance between the two sides is important because many people have been harmed by superstition and violence by ignoring reason. I think it's difficult to pick either side."
12624,211,0,40,INFJ,24,"<Yes>  If housework is left before taking a break, a strange discomfort remains in the mind. So, if possible, you want to finish the remaining chores before going to bed."
12625,211,0,40,INFJ,25,"<no>  I don't like it because I see a lot of cases where emotions become intense during an argument or the other person's personality is ignored. In an argument, there are many cases in which each other pushes their own assertions by distorting the facts in order to win over the other person with words. As a result, they may accept distorted information, so they try not to listen."
12626,211,0,40,INFJ,26,"<Yes>  As much as possible, I prefer to be alone without attracting attention from others. I don't want unnecessary attention. When I am alone, my mind and body are recharged and I feel relaxed. I don't give unnecessary attention to others because I think others will be like that too."
12627,211,0,40,INFJ,27,<no> Emotional ups and downs are not severe. I tend not to go into a very happy or sad state of mind. I usually empty my mind and focus only on my interests.
12628,211,0,40,INFJ,28,"<no>  Even when I see other people's inefficient behavior, I tend to point them out when he or she wants advice. More than that, I hate and get annoyed at people who don't have the will to do it."
12629,211,0,40,INFJ,29,"<no> In the past, I was a little inclined to do that, but these days I tend to do things quickly. Because it is convenient and efficient. There were many things I regretted leaving the habit of procrastinating for a long time. I have experienced a lot of loss as a result. On the other side of my heart, I was determined to fix this bad habit, and I was able to fix it with little effort. I learned that it is important not to create a lot of unnecessary work at all, and I also learned painfully that I should not plan excessive work or schedules beyond my capabilities. So these days, I tend not to make promises or work well unless it is absolutely necessary."
12630,211,0,40,INFJ,30,"<Yes>  am most curious about whether another world exists that I do not know about. Also, depending on whether they exist or not, the direction of my life can change, so I tend to be interested in them. But I see it as an inconclusive interest. However, I think being interested in it is important in life. It is because many people think that if they think that what they did while they were alive will affect them after they die, they will not be able to commit serious sins. This is because I also try not to create friction with others as much as possible and try to do good deeds."
12631,211,0,40,INFJ,31,<no>  liked spending time alone since I was a child. Even now. I like to have everything I need and enjoy my time in a relaxed and uninterrupted way.
12632,211,0,40,INFJ,32,"<neutrality>  think there is a difference between theory and practice. This is because I have seen many cases in which theory-oriented discussions that are far from actual phenomena waste time. That's why tabletop discussions that focus only on theory feel boring and I tend to dislike them. It is difficult to actually apply discussions and stories that are theoretical and focused only on theory, omitting advice from field practitioners and field experts."
12633,211,0,40,INFJ,33,"<neutrality> Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. There were cases where it was difficult to understand when the environment and culture in which I lived was completely different. It was difficult to understand and accept when we saw cases where it was taken for granted that certain actions or eating certain foods were taboo in the other's culture, or behaviors that were taboo or criminal in our country were allowed in other countries. Even if you can do it with your head, it's hard for your heart to accept it."
12634,211,0,40,INFJ,34,"<neutrality> They make decisions quickly, but they also postpone them due to work progress and external factors. When a variable occurs in the middle of work, you have to respond flexibly, so even if you make a decision depending on the nature of the work, you may have to change it. This is because there are many cases in which they fail to grasp the situation and push ahead with the initial decision."
12635,211,0,40,INFJ,35,"<neutrality>  There are times when I keep thinking about it, but I tend to try to forget it by doing other things. If the past work has been well done, I try to think more about the future work."
12636,211,0,40,INFJ,36,"<no>  If you spend time with a lot of people, your body and mind get tired and tired. Time alone relaxes and recharges me. My physical and mental condition tends to recover when I spend time alone listening to my favorite movies or music."
12637,211,0,40,INFJ,37,"<Yes> It is cumbersome to visit art museums in person, so I tend to appreciate art pieces online. I also enjoy looking for the background through the history of art and the biography of the artist."
12638,211,0,40,INFJ,38,"<no>  In most cases, I was able to accept and understand the feelings of others. In addition to superficial elements, I tend to infer the psychology that person will experience by focusing on the external aspects and background, such as the environment the person is in."
12639,211,0,40,INFJ,39,"<Yes> When I have work, I feel relieved when I write down my schedule. This is because it can prevent you from accidentally missing a task and allows you to manage your time better."
12640,211,0,40,INFJ,40,"<neutrality> When it comes to financial problems, I often feel anxious. I don't feel particularly anxious unless it's about money. It wasn't like this when I was young, but it was like that when I got older and had to contribute to my livelihood. It seems to be close to anxiety about survival. This tendency seems to have developed more because there was not much financial space. Other than that, I've never felt particularly anxious."
12641,211,0,40,INFJ,41,"<Yes> It's always strange to talk to the other person without seeing them face to face. And since there are many cases where I doubt whether I understand well or the other person really understands, I try to convey my intentions clearly through documents and text messages, if possible."
12642,211,0,40,INFJ,42,"<neutrality> If other people's different opinions are derived from rational grounds, try to understand them even if they take time. During a discussion, after searching for facts, I found out that my argument was wrong, and when the other person's opinion was correct, I would bend my will and follow the other person's opinion. If the basis and logic are clear, try to understand and respect the other person's opinion."
12643,211,0,40,INFJ,43,"<no> Usually, when I'm alone, I like to look up various hobbies or stories of history or mythology, so I don't meet people often. So I rarely contacted them first. Because of that tendency, I tend to like bare-handed exercise alone. Meeting a friend is when there is a family event or an urgent matter that I absolutely need."
12644,211,0,40,INFJ,44,"<Yes> Try to act according to the plan as much as possible. If there is a setback in the plan, adjust the plan again to make it as rational as possible. Recently, I wasted time due to unexpected things while I was doing what I had planned. I finished it as quickly as possible and returned to my original plan."
12645,211,0,40,INFJ,45,"<neutrality> Mistakes that need to be corrected tend to be looked back on because wrong actions need to be corrected. Once behavior is modified, it tends to be quickly forgotten. Other mistakes or regrets from long ago that do not serve as lessons are erased from memory. If I think about it, I tend to focus on other things to erase it from my head. Unnecessary past memories are not good for mental health. Because it interferes with planning for the future and living in the present."
12646,211,0,40,INFJ,46,"<no> Since this issue corresponds to the fundamental reason of my life, I am constantly interested in it. Looking into history and the lives of historical figures, I think about my values and direction of life. I think it's a very important thing for humans."
12647,211,0,40,INFJ,47,"<no>  Because I like realistic judgment, I hate being dominated by emotions. I've become more inclined to it lately. Because bad results occurred when dealing with emotions or dealing with others, experiences accumulated and avoided it."
12648,211,0,40,INFJ,48,"<Yes> When you point out the fault of the other person, there were many cases that the other person thought that their character was undermined. It is believed that this is because it is instinctively regarded as an attack on oneself. If this happens, he will not be able to accept it rationally, so you have to use a method that protects his face to some extent. In the past, I had little interest in speaking, but these days I am trying to learn a soft way of speaking and a way of speaking that protects others' self-esteem. It is because the other person agrees with my opinion when I treat the other person in a good way. The place of conversation is also important. Pointing out the other person in a place where there are many people is also a bad way."
12661,212,1,30,ESFJ,1,"<no>  don't make it regularly. They actively try to make new friends when the opportunity arises, but they are not regular."
12662,212,1,30,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  If I have an interest, I tend to spend a lot of time on it in my free time. These days, I'm interested in bowling."
12663,212,1,30,ESFJ,3,"<no>  don't want to cry just because my partner is crying. You may cry in a situation where you have to listen to the other person's story, empathize with them, and comfort them, but such cases are rare. I feel more like asking because I'm curious about why you're crying."
12664,212,1,30,ESFJ,4,"<Yes>  I'm making several preparations. This is because, by nature, I do not like things to go wrong, so I prefer to prepare in advance by thinking about the number of cases."
12665,212,1,30,ESFJ,5,"<neutrality>  guess it's different on a case by case basis. I haven't experienced any stressful situations lately, but it depends."
12666,212,1,30,ESFJ,6,"<Yes>  First, I talk to someone I already know. It's comfortable to talk to someone you know, explore the atmosphere, and try to talk to someone new from then on when you get used to it."
12667,212,1,30,ESFJ,7,"<Yes> I'm completely done with one thing and moving on to another. If you don't finish one thing and move on to another, it's psychologically disturbing. I like to work on other things with a sense of relief that one is over."
12668,212,1,30,ESFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I am not very sentimental. It can be sentimental at times, but not too far."
12669,212,1,30,ESFJ,9,"<neutrality>  tend to make plans with schedules or lists, but I don't like it. I write down important things that I must remember and keep in my phone diary or notepad, but I don't plan everything because I like it."
12670,212,1,30,ESFJ,10,"<no>  I am not suspicious of small mistakes. I doubt my knowledge if it's a big mistake, but I don't question my ability and knowledge even if it's a small mistake."
12671,212,1,30,ESFJ,11,"<Yes>  I try to approach and talk to people I am interested in and want to be friendly with. If there was a new employee who joined the company while working, I approached and tried to talk with him first if he had a tendency or image that I wanted to get close to."
12672,212,1,30,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in art at all. I have no artistic sense, so I am not interested in discussing things with interest."
12673,212,1,30,ESFJ,13,"<no>  I tend to be more emotional. The evaluation of the surroundings is similar. Due to the nature of my work, I have a lot of conversations with unspecified people, so I have to be rational, but I often get emotional, so I received a lot of advice."
12674,212,1,30,ESFJ,14,"<Yes>  I like to be spontaneous unless it's a pre-arranged schedule. So, when I have free time for a day, I also enjoy going on spontaneous day trips."
12675,212,1,30,ESFJ,15,"<neutrality>  guess it depends on the importance of the group I'm a part of. If the group I belong to is important and needs to be seen in the long term, I worry about how I will be seen and try hard, but if not, I don't care how I look."
12676,212,1,30,ESFJ,16,"<neutrality>  don't enjoy all group activities. If it's a field I'm interested in, I enjoy participating in group activities, but if it's not, I don't participate. These days, I only participate in group activities related to bowling that I am interested in, and I do not have any other group activities because I am not interested in other fields."
12677,212,1,30,ESFJ,17,"<no>  like both books and movies, so when I get a chance to enjoy quiet time, I spend it mainly on reading or watching movies, but I don't like works that allow you to interpret the ending in your own way. I enjoy reading and watching movies as a hobby, but if the ending is open, it feels like a waste of time."
12678,212,1,30,ESFJ,18,"<no>  I tend to want my own success more and feel more satisfied when I succeed. You may feel proud of helping others succeed, but I don't think there's anything as satisfying as your own success."
12679,212,1,30,ESFJ,19,"<no>  I don't like that because if I have a lot of interests, I rank them according to importance and process them. I like it as much as it's an interest, and I don't want to miss it because it's important, so I don't want to miss it after solving it one by one."
12680,212,1,30,ESFJ,20,<Yes>  do have a lot of worries. Maybe that's why my spouse also has useless thoughts and worries. I think it's because I don't like things going wrong because of my personality and I don't like being stressed out from it.
12681,212,1,30,ESFJ,21,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid leadership roles. The role of a leader supporter is good, but I want to avoid a leader who needs everyone's attention and attention and responsibility."
12682,212,1,30,ESFJ,22,"<Yes>  Since I have no sense of art, I have almost no knowledge and no interest, so I think I have no artistic inclination. I've never been praised for drawing, singing, dressing fashion sense or anything else, and I'm rather intimidated."
12683,212,1,30,ESFJ,23,"<no>  think both emotions and reason are important. So even if you ask the question the other way round, the answer is no. I don't think we can make the world a better place by valuing one over the other."
12684,212,1,30,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  I need to finish all my housework. If you take a break while you have housework to do, you don't seem to rest because you're anxious. Even if there is no time to take a break while doing housework, I do everything from housework unconditionally."
12685,212,1,30,ESFJ,25,"<no>  don't enjoy watching other people argue. If you look at the debate a little, you will see that it is 'useless' and 'useless consumption of emotions'. I tend to feel this way a lot, so I don't enjoy watching the debate."
12686,212,1,30,ESFJ,26,"<Yes>  hate being focused. It has been like that since childhood. When I was in school, I didn't like going out to the front because I had to get a certificate during assembly time, and even when I was in charge of the office, I cried because I hated the attention of my teachers and classmates. Even if I have good achievements or results, I tend to want them to pass without attracting other people's attention, so I try to avoid attracting attention in everything."
12687,212,1,30,ESFJ,27,"<Yes>  tend to have some emotional ups and downs. It's gotten a lot better, but that's enough to say so. Even if you're angry, when your spouse drags you out to drive, you quickly like it and solve it, so it seems that your emotions change drastically. Even when working, if the other person doesn't come out with good manners, he gets angry and gets angry, but when the other person apologizes, he immediately smiles and works."
12688,212,1,30,ESFJ,28,"<Yes>  tend to get annoyed when the other person doesn't follow me and satisfy me as efficiently as I expected. It's the same when you look at your family and company. I get angry when my younger siblings don't meet my expectations because they do things inefficiently, and among my co-workers, I hate that employee when their work load drops because they work inefficiently."
12689,212,1,30,ESFJ,29,"<no>  I never put off what needs to be done. Due to my personality, I caution that today's work can never be postponed to tomorrow, and if I put off what I have to do and do other things, I can't do that because I'm anxious and can't concentrate."
12690,212,1,30,ESFJ,30,<no>  I have no interest in the afterlife. So the question isn't interesting at all. People think that death is the end.
12691,212,1,30,ESFJ,31,"<Yes>  prefer to go out and roam rather than stay at home alone, so of course I want to spend time with others rather than alone. Even when I simply go for a walk, rather than alone, I find someone to walk with and chat with."
12692,212,1,30,ESFJ,32,"<Yes>  I hate being boring. I think the theoretical and fundamental things themselves are boring and I am not interested, so it is frustrating to even think about discussing them."
12693,212,1,30,ESFJ,33,"<neutrality>  I am neutral because I have empathy for people from different backgrounds, but not 100%. I don't think it makes sense to easily sympathize with someone with a different background. I can sympathize with you in a certain way, but I have to be the target of comparison because I have a different background from myself, so I wonder if I can easily sympathize. Compared to me, I agree with what I can relate to, but it's not that I don't, so it's neutral."
12694,212,1,30,ESFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to procrastinate making decisions. In fact, I would like to express that I hold it because I want to be careful rather than the expression of delay. I think I can't go back once I decide, so I want to be careful, so I delay my decision as much as possible."
12695,212,1,30,ESFJ,35,"<Yes> When I make a decision, I'm not the type to rethink, ""Is it a bad decision?"" As I answered before this question, I tend to postpone my decision as much as possible before making a decision."
12696,212,1,30,ESFJ,36,"<no>  I prefer to be with someone rather than alone, but I tend to think that spending time alone is better than unwinding at a party or event."
12697,212,1,30,ESFJ,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries, and I'm not interested in appreciating art works, and it doesn't match my inclination. Since I don't have artistic sense, I can't admire and be moved by seeing things like that."
12698,212,1,30,ESFJ,38,"<no>  don't often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. When I'm having a hard time, if the other person pours out their emotions one-sidedly, there are times when it's hard to empathize and understand, but other than those cases, it's not hard."
12699,212,1,30,ESFJ,39,"<no>  I don't like to plan my daily to-dos. If I only decide what I absolutely have to do that day and finish it, I like to have fun without a plan after that."
12700,212,1,30,ESFJ,40,"<Yes>  don't like to feel insecure, so I tend to block those elements in advance. That's why I rarely feel anxious."
12701,212,1,30,ESFJ,41,"<no>  like the phone better. Usually, if you are just asking about your regards, you can text or talk, but if not, a phone call is more convenient. If it's urgent or you need to correct a wrong thing, it's frustrating to express it through text, and I can't read your emotions."
12702,212,1,30,ESFJ,42,"<no>  don't spend a lot of time trying to understand opinions that differ from mine. I will invest some time, but I don't want to spend a lot of time trying to understand someone who has a different opinion than mine. Let's see it as a waste of time and admit the difference."
12703,212,1,30,ESFJ,43,"<no>  I'm not the type to contact you to meet first. I'm trying to contact you first, but most of them have to contact me first, but I tend to meet them."
12704,212,1,30,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  don't like to deviate from the direction I thought, so when something goes wrong with my plans, I get annoyed and try to get back to my original plan as quickly as possible. Looking back at the time when I planned to meet my family and acquaintances during my recent vacation and there was a problem in the middle, it was a situation where the plan was disrupted and the problem could go until the next schedule. has been omitted. I don't like being twisted and stressed out by that much trouble, so I try to get back to my original plan as quickly as possible."
12705,212,1,30,ESFJ,45,"<no> When I think back on mistakes I made a long time ago, I feel ashamed, so I don't want to think about them again, and I don't regret them either. It's too late to think that the water has already been spilled and regret it."
12706,212,1,30,ESFJ,46,"<no>  I hate this question itself. I want to know where the time is to think about why people exist and why they live. I think that you are born and exist, and you live, so think simply and enjoy life."
12707,212,1,30,ESFJ,47,"<neutrality>  I tend to have emotional ups and downs, but I'm the type to be swayed and controlled, so I wonder if that's why the ups and downs are more severe. It is evaluated similarly by the surroundings."
12708,212,1,30,ESFJ,48,"<Yes> Even if the other person's fault is obvious, I try to save face after I have made the other person realize the fault and let them know. Everyone can make mistakes, and if the other person admits to making a mistake, I wonder what more I can gain from losing face. If it's a relationship that needs to continue, I think it's important to remind people of their mistakes and save face."
12721,213,0,40,INTP,1,"<no>  I don't like hanging out with a lot of people. Maybe it's because I'm in my 40s, so I don't have many opportunities to meet friends."
12722,213,0,40,INTP,2,"<neutrality> I'm not very curious about new things. I don't have any special interests, but I like animal documentaries, so I look them up."
12723,213,0,40,INTP,3,"<neutrality>  When someone else is crying, they become emotionally depressed. Especially when children are crying, I want to help them, and I want to help them in any way possible."
12724,213,0,40,INTP,4,"<neutrality> We think of countermeasures, but often miss them. Looking back on the past, when I encountered a problem, I often solved it at that time, and for this reason, I am trying to make preparations in advance."
12725,213,0,40,INTP,5,<no>  I hate psychological pressure so much. I tend to avoid unbearable pressure rather than pursue practical benefits.
12726,213,0,40,INTP,6,"<Yes> Talk to people you know and don't bother approaching strangers first. I have to introduce myself, I don't want to give specific answers to people who don't know a lot of information, and I hate the situation itself where I have to be formal."
12727,213,0,40,INTP,7,"<Yes>  I tend to think a lot when I am working. My attention span isn't very long, so if I do multiple things at the same time, I'm bound to make mistakes. When I run a shopping mall, I have to proceed in the order that customers order, and if I proceed in the order of products, there are parts that I miss."
12728,213,0,40,INTP,8,"<neutrality>  I wasn't like that before, but these days I seem to be on the sentimental side. Especially when animals or children are in a difficult situation, I feel bad and want to help in any way."
12729,213,0,40,INTP,9,"<neutrality>  I tend to plan in a big way. I've been working without a detailed plan, but these days I write down important information in my diary and don't use electronic tools."
12730,213,0,40,INTP,10,"<no>  I think mistakes always happen. Whether it's a small mistake or a big mistake, I try to make up for it, and I'm not good at self-criticism."
12731,213,0,40,INTP,11,"<no>  Few people are interested. Even if there is someone who is interested, I don't think I'll go over and talk first."
12732,213,0,40,INTP,12,<no>  I am not interested in art per se. I think art works are well-packaged marketing that fits the situation of the times.
12733,213,0,40,INTP,13,"<Yes>  Always try to think rationally and averagely. Except for children and animals, I think rationally, and the evaluation of my acquaintances seems to be the same."
12734,213,0,40,INTP,14,"<neutrality>  If there is no problem with the promised work or work in the same daily life, there are occasional new things, such as going on a trip alone."
12735,213,0,40,INTP,15,"<Yes>  I don't care what others think of me. When I was younger, I thought I cared about how I looked to others, but these days I don't think I'm thinking about that. Maybe it's because I'm older, but I think I'm more important than others."
12736,213,0,40,INTP,16,<no>  I hate group activities. I just enjoy watching movies alone.
12737,213,0,40,INTP,17,"<neutrality>  I don't like difficult books or art films. I like movies just for fun. I recently watched La La Land, and there may be differences between people who see whether the movie has a happy ending or a sad ending. I like this light interpretation."
12738,213,0,40,INTP,18,<no>  I want to be more successful than others. I believe that I can take care of my surroundings only when I am successful and have room to spare.
12739,213,0,40,INTP,19,"<no>  doesn't exist. I'm not deliberately looking for something fun. If something interesting happens by chance, I try to run it, but I'm interested in it, so I don't worry about which one to do first."
12740,213,0,40,INTP,20,"<no>  Of course you worry about what might go wrong. But rather than worrying about things going wrong, we look for solutions when things go wrong."
12741,213,0,40,INTP,21,"<Yes>  hate being in front of others. If you think that there are people who believe in you as a leader and follow you, you will feel stressed out with responsibility."
12742,213,0,40,INTP,22,"<Yes>  Since art is subjective, I think that what is valuable to others may not be a big deal to me. There are also opposite situations."
12743,213,0,40,INTP,23,"<neutrality> In the past, I thought that if I judged rationally, there would be no problem. But I think situations don't fit together like math, and there are always exceptions. Most importantly, I think it is more important to understand each situation."
12744,213,0,40,INTP,24,"<Yes>  In order to relax, there should be no after work. If I have to do housework after resting, I don't think it's comfortable even when I'm resting."
12745,213,0,40,INTP,25,"<neutrality>  I have no great interest in the South. However, if either side is in a unfair situation, I have an idea that I want to help."
12746,213,0,40,INTP,26,<Yes>  I don't like to be in front of others. It's good to just run normally without any problems.
12747,213,0,40,INTP,27,<no>  Always try to keep your composure. I try to think rationally even when problems or bad things happen.
12748,213,0,40,INTP,28,<no>  Not sure if I'm correct or not. I tend to think it is because I have judged myself that others are not efficient.
12749,213,0,40,INTP,29,"<neutrality>  Usually, when I have something to do, I try to do it right away when I think of it. But there are times when I just think about it and forget about it. Recently, there are times when I receive a Crowdworks text message and think that I have to work on it, then forget it and think about it after time."
12750,213,0,40,INTP,30,"<neutrality> When I die, I think it's over. However, there have been religions for thousands of years, and when I see people talking about the afterlife, I sometimes wonder, ¡°Is there something there?¡±"
12751,213,0,40,INTP,31,"<no>  I like being alone. These days, acquaintances around me are faithful to their families, so I don't have a chance to meet them often."
12752,213,0,40,INTP,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in obvious stories. I'm just interested in interesting issues that can be fun, laugh and enjoy."
12753,213,0,40,INTP,33,"<neutrality>  I don't think I can experience an environment I've never experienced just by thinking about it. If your background is different from mine, I don't think I've been able to experience it and can only guess and can't fully relate to it."
12754,213,0,40,INTP,34,"<neutrality> Each situation is different. If I have a lot to lose, I will think a lot before making a decision, and if I think there is not a big loss, I will make a quick decision on what I think is right."
12755,213,0,40,INTP,35,"<neutrality>  If you can change your decision, you think a lot after making it. But if I can't change the decision I made, I follow it without regret."
12756,213,0,40,INTP,36,"<no>  It's been a long time since I participated in a party or event. These days, I spend my time watching animal documentaries or movies."
12757,213,0,40,INTP,37,<no>  There is nothing other than a group tour of an art gallery when I was a student. I am not interested in things called works of art.
12758,213,0,40,INTP,38,"<neutrality>  It's understandable in terms of average emotions I think. However, religious feelings cannot be empathized."
12759,213,0,40,INTP,39,"<neutrality>  I can't say I plan every day, but I have my own routine. I try to stick to that routine."
12760,213,0,40,INTP,40,"<neutrality>  I am always anxious. I don't think there is anything that can be solved by worrying too much. Financially and health-wise, I always feel anxious, but I don't think deeply."
12761,213,0,40,INTP,41,"<no>  When it comes to work, I prefer talking on the phone rather than texting or emailing. I often talk on the phone rather than texting with my acquaintances. Texting is annoying, but phone calls are more convenient."
12762,213,0,40,INTP,42,"<no>  My opinion is not the right answer, so I don't worry too much about opinions that differ from mine. I'm trying to think that it might be."
12763,213,0,40,INTP,43,"<no>  I rarely contact people around me first. Unless there is a special event, I rarely contact you first."
12764,213,0,40,INTP,44,"<Yes>  When plans go awry, we put the problem first. If a problem is found, we try to solve it in order, starting with that problem. In the process of sending a package to a customer, there was a case where the package was lost. We told the customer and solved the problem sequentially."
12765,213,0,40,INTP,45,"<no>  I regret it, but I think the past cannot be helped. I try not to make the same mistake."
12766,213,0,40,INTP,46,"<Yes>  No philosophical thoughts. Thinking that there is nothing to change, I live thinking only of reality right now."
12767,213,0,40,INTP,47,"<no>  Always try to think rationally. I am swayed by my emotions, but most of the time I make rational decisions, and my acquaintances also think of me as a rational person."
12768,213,0,40,INTP,48,"<no> If the other party's fault is clear, it's face-to-face and nothing. Wrong is wrong and cannot be overlooked."
12781,214,0,20,ESFP,1,<Yes>  The reason is that I get along well with new friends I meet in society without any major problems.
12782,214,0,20,ESFP,2,"<no>  One hobby for a long time. These days, I am interested in travel and actually travel often."
12783,214,0,20,ESFP,3,<Yes>  The reason depends on what kind of relationship the other person has with you when someone else is crying and what they are crying for.
12784,214,0,20,ESFP,4,"<Yes>  The reason is that you can respond to a crisis by setting up a number of workarounds. This is because when there is no workaround, you can feel a huge sense of loss if things go wrong."
12785,214,0,20,ESFP,5,"<Yes>  The reason is that even in a high-pressure environment, you are nervous only at the beginning, and the tremor disappears when you start giving a presentation. Recently, I had a chance to give a presentation in front of many people, and I finished it calmly and well."
12786,214,0,20,ESFP,6,"<no>  The reason is that as much as I like meeting new people, I tend to approach new people first."
12787,214,0,20,ESFP,7,"<Yes>  It's more comfortable to finish one thing than to do many things. The reason is that even in the case of Cloud Works, I tend to complete one project and move on to the next one rather than doing multiple projects."
12788,214,0,20,ESFP,8,"<Yes> The reason was that it wasn't like that before, but these days, emotional changes seem to be more active."
12789,214,0,20,ESFP,9,<no>  The reason is that I like to improvise. I don't use diaries or plans well.
12790,214,0,20,ESFP,10,"<no>  The reason is that if you make a small mistake, you comfort yourself that you don't have to make the same mistake next time."
12791,214,0,20,ESFP,11,"<no>  Reason is not afraid to talk to people. If there's someone I'm interested in, I tend to talk to them first."
12792,214,0,20,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  I like to appreciate art, but I'm not very interested in discussing art. The reason why I am not very interested in discussing is that I do not have enough knowledge to discuss works of art."
12793,214,0,20,ESFP,13,"<no>  I used to be rational, but I seem to have changed emotionally recently. People around me still think I'm rational."
12794,214,0,20,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  Even if I have a schedule for the day, I tend to enjoy spontaneous appointments. I recently set up a schedule for the day, but in the end, only a few things did go according to schedule, and everything was improvised."
12795,214,0,20,ESFP,15,"<no>  Other people's eyes don't matter. I don't have a specific reason or reason, but I think that's because I get a lot of stress when I'm conscious of other people's eyes."
12796,214,0,20,ESFP,16,"<Yes>  The reason is that I enjoy meeting people, so I also like to promote friendship through group activities."
12797,214,0,20,ESFP,17,"<no>  I hate open endings the most. The reason is that I don't seem to have enough imagination to think of an open ending, and I hate it because I feel uncomfortable."
12798,214,0,20,ESFP,18,"<no>  The reason is that I tend to be very considerate, but I don't seem to back down when it comes to success."
12799,214,0,20,ESFP,19,"<no> The reason is because when you have one interest, you enjoy it for a long time."
12800,214,0,20,ESFP,20,"<no>  The reason is that when I worry about it, I don't think about it much because I get stressed out."
12801,214,0,20,ESFP,21,<no>  I like people and enjoy being a leader. The reason is that he has held many positions such as executive manager since before.
12802,214,0,20,ESFP,22,<no>  I think I have some artistic flair. I love music and I like to sing in front of a lot of people.
12803,214,0,20,ESFP,23,"<no>  The reason is that I am also changing emotionally, but when emotions precede reason, accurate judgments cannot be made."
12804,214,0,20,ESFP,24,"<Yes>  First of all, I like to rest in an organized environment. The reason is that if you don't, you can't rest comfortably."
12805,214,0,20,ESFP,25,<Yes>  The reason is that it is a good experience because you can know other people's thoughts due to other people's arguments.
12806,214,0,20,ESFP,26,"<Yes>  I like people, but I don't bother trying to get their attention. The reason seems to be because there is also a tendency that does not like meddling in other people's affairs."
12807,214,0,20,ESFP,27,"<no>  The reason has changed emotionally, but so far the emotions don't change very quickly."
12808,214,0,20,ESFP,28,"<Yes> The reason is, at first you think it could be, but it's annoying if it's the same over time. I think that way when I see new recruits who work at a company and don't grow."
12809,214,0,20,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  The reason is that recently, as priorities have changed, there are often cases in which the work you originally wanted to do is done last."
12810,214,0,20,ESFP,30,<Yes>  The reason is I think there is an afterlife these days. I think it came about because I watched a lot of that on YouTube.
12811,214,0,20,ESFP,31,<Yes> The reason seems to be the same these days because I originally liked spending time with other people.
12812,214,0,20,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  The reason is that I don't enjoy the discussion itself, and even more so the principled story. For example, when others are discussing, I just watch without interfering."
12813,214,0,20,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  The reason is that people are different, so if you lived a different life than me, I think it could be enough."
12814,214,0,20,ESFP,34,"<no> The reason is that if you are confident about your decision, you tend to act quickly as you decide."
12815,214,0,20,ESFP,35,"<no>  The reason is, if a bad result came out, I look back once."
12816,214,0,20,ESFP,36,"<Yes>  The reason is that these days, if I have an appointment, I go on a trip or meet up with friends on the weekend. Many are better than alone."
12817,214,0,20,ESFP,37,<Yes>  The reason is that I enjoy seeing works of art or watching performances in places like art galleries. But I don't enjoy having discussions.
12818,214,0,20,ESFP,38,"<no>  The reason is that people have different environments in which they have lived, so just because I am not, I do not think that the other person must be the same. When there is a difference of opinion, I tend to think from the other person's point of view and try to understand the other person."
12819,214,0,20,ESFP,39,"<neutrality>  The reason is that I like to improvise rather than plan. However, I tend to make plans for work."
12820,214,0,20,ESFP,40,"<no>  The reason is because I feel insecure but I try to overcome it. And there's nothing to call it an opportunity, but the motto is, if you can't avoid it, enjoy it."
12821,214,0,20,ESFP,41,<no>  The reason is that I like getting answers quickly over the phone rather than through text messages or KakaoTalk.
12822,214,0,20,ESFP,42,"<neutrality> The reason is, as I have said before, the environment in which we have lived is different, so we fully understand that opinions differ. So I don't think I can say that I spend a lot of time on it."
12823,214,0,20,ESFP,43,"<Yes>  The reason is because I like people, I like two rather than alone, and I like three rather than two. That's why I tend to contact them first."
12824,214,0,20,ESFP,44,"<Yes>  The reason is that the loss is small when returning to the plan quickly, so I tend to try to return quickly."
12825,214,0,20,ESFP,45,"<neutrality>  The reason is that even though I wonder if it would have been different if I had done this a long time ago, I try to comfort myself by concluding that the result would have been the same anyway. The fort has no such regrets."
12826,214,0,20,ESFP,46,"<Yes>  I like to think simply and live. The reason is that I once thought deeply about the existence of humans and the reason for living, and I felt intimidated by myself feeling infinitely smaller."
12827,214,0,20,ESFP,47,"<neutrality>  The reason is that I tend to control my emotions well, but these days I seem to be a bit swayed. People around me say that I am still good at controlling my emotions."
12828,214,0,20,ESFP,48,"<neutrality>  The reason is that if it's not a big mistake and I regret it, I don't want to make it a problem. I think everyone can make mistakes."
12841,215,0,30,INFP,1,<no>  don't make it regularly because I find dating new people very difficult and tiring.
12842,215,0,30,INFP,2,"<Yes>  I spend most of my free time on my interests. These days, I am interested in history, so I enjoy watching related books and videos."
12843,215,0,30,INFP,3,"<Yes>  Yes, it wasn't like that when I was young, but as I enter my 30s, when someone else cries, even if I don't know the story, I feel sad and the tip of my nose frowns."
12844,215,0,30,INFP,4,"<Yes>  I often think of the worst-case scenario for what will happen in the future, so I try to make as many contingency plans as possible."
12845,215,0,30,INFP,5,"<no>  I try to keep my composure, but it's not easy. My voice trembled a lot when I introduced myself in front of several people I hadn't met recently."
12846,215,0,30,INFP,6,<Yes>  tend to talk with people I know because people I already know are easier to carry on a conversation with than people I'm meeting for the first time.
12847,215,0,30,INFP,7,"<Yes>  I tend to try to do one thing perfectly. Although various projects were opened in the recent data project and I was able to participate at the same time, I finished one and participated in another project."
12848,215,0,30,INFP,8,"<no> I've seen some movies that are known to be sentimental, but I don't think they're sentimental, as they aren't very memorable."
12849,215,0,30,INFP,9,"<no>  It's not like that. In the past, whenever I did something, I made a plan and proceeded, but after a few experiences, I decided that it was meaningless, so I stopped planning."
12850,215,0,30,INFP,10,"<Yes> The project I am working on is an inspection work that requires meticulousness. A year ago, there were almost no mistakes, but recently mistakes have started to appear, and I think my meticulousness has become dull."
12851,215,0,30,INFP,11,"<no>  It's very difficult. In my experience, if I show interest in someone I'm interested in, I tend not to approach them because they may feel uncomfortable."
12852,215,0,30,INFP,12,<no>  find it very interesting. I enjoy it to the point where I feel like I get a new feeling when I listen to other people's various opinions on the works I've seen without much thought.
12853,215,0,30,INFP,13,"<no>  I consider myself to be of the opposite sex, but when I listen to the people around me, especially my father, I often admit that I acted on my emotions."
12854,215,0,30,INFP,14,"<Yes>  Even when I go on a trip, I like to walk without a destination and head to where my heart goes, rather than moving according to a plan."
12855,215,0,30,INFP,15,"<no>  I'm always worried about how others see me. Perhaps because I've been the eldest son for a long time, I think I can only be happy if I show myself well to others."
12856,215,0,30,INFP,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy group activities very much. In group activities, there are many rules to communicate with each other and follow, but since I absolutely need time alone, I do group activities as little as possible."
12857,215,0,30,INFP,17,"<no>  don't like movies where the ending is interpreted differently by each individual. I like movies whose endings can relate to the majority because I already have a personal appreciation for the movies. So I had a lot of expectations for the movie Burning, but I didn't have any particular impressions right after watching the movie. After that, I was able to come across various interpretations of the ending from the audience, but they were all plausible, so I thought the director was irresponsible."
12858,215,0,30,INFP,18,"<Yes>  I didn't get a specific answer for the reason, but if I helped others succeed, I think the fact that my presence was needed by the other person makes my presence great."

12861,215,0,30,INFP,21,"<Yes>  As a leader, I personally find it tiring because I have to put myself down and assign the identity of the group to myself. So, as long as there are other people who want to be leaders, I want to avoid them."
12862,215,0,30,INFP,22,"<no>  I have loved music since I was young, and I have never learned it, but I think I have a strong artistic inclination compared to other people, as I enjoy music that other people do not enjoy."

12864,215,0,30,INFP,24,"<Yes>  I am sensitive to the pressure of having to do something, so I think taking a break after being released from it is the true meaning of rest."

12867,215,0,30,INFP,27,"<no>  Unless I'm standing in front of a lot of people, I'm not very emotionally agitated. That's why it takes time to find your composure no matter how you feel."
12868,215,0,30,INFP,28,"<no>  I often see colleagues who do not work efficiently on projects that I am already skilled at, but I think it is natural that they may not be efficient because of their lack of experience and different people's abilities."

12872,215,0,30,INFP,32,"<no>  I will listen carefully to the principled story if it is a field I do not know. Even in conversations with my father, hearing new information about the theory is a good opportunity to change my mind."

12876,215,0,30,INFP,36,"<no> Parties and events make me more tired because various stimuli are input to me. When I'm exhausted, I tend to be at ease by watching YouTube or listening to music by myself."
12877,215,0,30,INFP,37,"<Yes>  It's not a museum, but I like listening to music. When I put on headphones and listen to good music over and over again, the type of impression and part that moves me change each time, and I enjoy this."

12881,215,0,30,INFP,41,"<Yes> Obviously, I enjoyed talking on the phone a lot back in my school days, but now I find it annoying and inconvenient. I think it's because I have a strong tendency to be comfortable with myself, and I think one of the reasons I avoid phone calls is that I feel constrained for a certain amount of time once I start talking on the phone."
12882,215,0,30,INFP,42,"<no>  spend a lot of time trying to understand opinions that are very different from mine. But even if it's a little time, I take the time to think to understand the opinion.

12883,215,0,30,INFP,43,"<no>  It's not that I don't contact you at all, but I usually don't contact you first. First of all, recently, I don't want to meet up with my friends, and I think it's troublesome to promise to meet them, so I don't contact them first."
12884,215,0,30,INFP,44,"<Yes>  If my plans are disrupted, I try to get back to you as quickly as possible.

12888,215,0,30,INFP,48,"<Yes> Even if the other person's fault is obvious, if it was not done intentionally, I will do anything to make him feel sorry. It's because it's hard to bear to see the other person being sorry."

When I say something in my heart, it's hard to even think about the number of cases like that, how will the other person react if I say this."
13022,218,1,40,ISFJ,2,"<Yes>  I am taking my time to explore various interests. These days, YouTube is doing well, so there is no shortage of exploring interests just by searching. These days, I am interested in real estate and retirement."
13023,218,1,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes>  When I see someone else crying, I want to cry too. The reason is because when I see someone crying, I can feel that person's emotions and my emotions become sad and tears come out."
13024,218,1,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I tend to make preparations. The reason is that my husband is about to retire, so I am looking for information on what to do after retirement. I am afraid of an unprepared post-retirement."
13025,218,1,40,ISFJ,5,"<no>  have a hard time keeping my composure. The reason is that tension rises with strangers and unfamiliar places. A few days ago, I had to go to Gangnam Station by myself, and whenever I go to a place for the first time, I feel nervous the moment I leave the house, and when I get home, that tension is relieved."
13026,218,1,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  I tend to talk to people I know. The reason is that it's awkward to pick up a topic to talk about when meeting a new person, and people who know me know my personality, so there's no awkwardness at all just listening without talking, but it's uncomfortable because I feel like I have to keep communicating with someone new. ."
13027,218,1,40,ISFJ,7,"<Yes>  I tend to do other things after completing one project. The reason is that it gives me a sense of accomplishment and comfort when I finish one thing at a time rather than doing many things at once. I am currently working on a project at Crowdworks. It's a lot of work and you have to do it meticulously, but if you do a project consistently, you'll become proficient and the speed at which you do it will be over quickly."
13028,218,1,40,ISFJ,8,"<Yes>  I'm sentimental. The reason is that I cry easily because I am immersed in the emotions of the main character while watching the movie. When the main character does well, I smile without even realizing it."
13029,218,1,40,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  like making plans. The reason is that I have a habit of writing down important schedules on my phone calendar and checking them when I wake up in the morning. We plan your itinerary carefully so that you can spend a short time efficiently. It feels good when something goes according to plan, because it feels like something has been accomplished."
13030,218,1,40,ISFJ,10,"<Yes> I've been disappointed in myself because of my mistakes. The reason is that last year, I bought Samsung Electronics, which can be called the national stock, in preparation for my old age. When we first bought it, we bought it well at a low price, but when we saw it go up, we bought a lot with a house mortgage loan. Right now, I can't sell it due to a lot of losses, and the interest rate has risen, so the interest on the loan is also a burden. I recommended it, and my husband agreed, but I feel guilty for ruining my old age because of me."
13031,218,1,40,ISFJ,11,"<no>  find it very difficult to approach and start a conversation. The reason is that even if you're interested in that person, you just look at him, but you can't approach him first and talk to him. I want that person to come up to me and talk to me."
13032,218,1,40,ISFJ,12,<no>  I am interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. The reason is that other people felt this way after seeing the same work. I think it will help me understand the work by knowing the part I missed that I did not feel. But I prefer to listen rather than speak my mind.
13033,218,1,40,ISFJ,13,"<neutrality>  I consider myself an emotional person. I think she listens well, empathizes well, and is considerate, but her younger daughter says that when she tells her mother something difficult, she suggests a way to solve this problem rather than comforting her. The child just wants it to end in empathy."
13034,218,1,40,ISFJ,14,"<Yes>  I like to be spontaneous. When I look in the mirror and I don't like my hair, I think I should go to the hairdresser. As I¡¯m getting older, I rest when I¡¯m tired, go to exercise when I¡¯m frustrated, eat when I¡¯m hungry¡¦ I feel comfortable doing it whenever I want, regardless of time or date."
13035,218,1,40,ISFJ,15,"<Yes>  I tend to worry a lot about who I look like. That's why I seem to be cautious about every word I say to someone I'm meeting for the first time. There were many cases where I was unexpectedly hurt by people who spoke well. They say it insignificantly, but there are times when I, the listener, get hurt. After that, I think more before I speak. I want to be seen by others as a comfortable and caring person."
13036,218,1,40,ISFJ,16,"<no>  I don't enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is because I like activities that I do alone. The church is also a group, but these days, due to corona, there were a lot of activities that I personally do than a group. Even if we didn't have to do it as a group, there was no discomfort. Rather, it was good that the time for volunteering decreased and the time for meditating on the Word increased."
13037,218,1,40,ISFJ,17,"<Yes>  I like movies with open endings. The reason is that not everyone has the same ending, and I like that the ending can be made depending on the viewer. I watched the drama ""My Mister"" a while ago. I liked that it had an open ending. No one knows the end of our lives. I am making it myself."
13038,218,1,40,ISFJ,18,<Yes>  I am more satisfied with helping others succeed than myself. The reason is that I feel more satisfied if others succeed with my advice. I want to live a life of service and helping others.
13039,218,1,40,ISFJ,19,"<no>  have a lot of interests and I have never known what to do next. I am interested in real estate and retirement these days, so I am collecting information about it and reading books. YouTube only shows relevant content, so I don't waste time on anything else."
13040,218,1,40,ISFJ,20,"<Yes>  I am often worried that things might go wrong. Since I'm older, it's not easy to recover if I do something wrong. I made a mistake in stock investment last year, so all my assets are tied up. I think I will invest more carefully so as not to make mistakes again."
13041,218,1,40,ISFJ,21,"<Yes>  I really want to avoid leadership roles. The reason is that as a member of a group, I tend to cooperate well and follow decisions well, but as a leader, it is very difficult for me to take the initiative in doing something."
13042,218,1,40,ISFJ,22,<no>  I think I have artistic inclinations. I think my oldest daughter's artistic inclination resembles mine. I like to paint and beautify the house.
13043,218,1,40,ISFJ,23,"<neutrality>  I believe that the world will be a better place when emotions and reason go well together. If only emotions are ahead, this world will become a city of crime, and if only reason is ahead, it will become a very desolate world. If people's emotions are the basis and there is rationality above them, it will be a good world where people are considerate of each other and help each other."
13044,218,1,40,ISFJ,24,"<Yes>  I do housework first before taking a break. Even if it's hard right now, you can get a complete rest by cleaning the house and resting. If you don't clean up and rest, the dishes that are not cleaned, the bed blanket that is not cleaned, and the cushions that are not organized on the sofa interfere with your rest and make it uncomfortable. It feels good to clean up and rest."
13045,218,1,40,ISFJ,25,"<no>  I don't enjoy other people's arguments. It is very uncomfortable to see a person who logically argues for himself, but only unfolds his own argument rather than listening to the other person's thoughts. I change the channel in anger when I listen to a political discussion in particular."
13046,218,1,40,ISFJ,26,"<Yes>  I try not to attract other people's attention. Since I was a child, I have been a child who does not stand out from others. I don't like getting attention from others with my words and actions. When there are many people around, I listen to other people's stories more than I talk."
13047,218,1,40,ISFJ,27,"<Yes> My emotions change quickly. There also seems to be an effect of menopause. I like the drama Reply 1988, but I laugh and cry while watching one episode, and my emotions go back and forth when I watch it."
13048,218,1,40,ISFJ,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who aren't as effective as I am. For example, my eldest daughter's personality resembles me a lot. When I see her timid and slow, I get angry because she seems to be looking at me."
13049,218,1,40,ISFJ,29,"<no>  don't put things off until the end. When I have something to do, I do it first. I tend to do other things after doing that, so there was no case like that."
13050,218,1,40,ISFJ,30,"<Yes>  I am interested in questions about the afterlife. I am a Christian, so I believe that I will go to heaven after death. If people around me ask such a question, I think they will like it because it is an opportunity to convey God."
13051,218,1,40,ISFJ,31,"<no>  would rather spend time with my family than alone. I used to be happy when I was alone, but now I'm happy when I'm with you."
13052,218,1,40,ISFJ,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in theory-oriented discussions. Maybe it's because I'm weak in theory. When I learn something, I forget it quickly and I don't remember it well, so the discussion is boring. I think talking in principle is a waste of time. At that time, I have other thoughts in my head."
13053,218,1,40,ISFJ,33,"<Yes>  I think I can relate to someone from a completely different background than mine. I don't think it's completely different until you think that the background is different. How many people in the world are from the same background as me? Although they are people from a completely different environment than me, I think they have common areas, and I think we need to understand and sympathize with each other from that point on."
13054,218,1,40,ISFJ,34,"<Yes>  I tend to postpone decisions until the end. It's so difficult to decide if the current decision is the right one or if there is no better alternative. There are a lot of things that are mainly related to money, I want to move, but I just need to stay in Seoul. Or should I move to Gyeonggi-do and use the rest of the money? It's hard to decide when it comes to money like that."
13055,218,1,40,ISFJ,35,"<no>  I keep rethinking the decisions I have already made. There was a stock I wanted to buy this time, but I couldn't buy it because the timing wasn't right. I gave up buying that stock. But the stocks I own don't go up, they go down, but those stocks keep going up. I felt so stupid and upset myself."
13056,218,1,40,ISFJ,36,"<no>  don't relieve fatigue with fun parties and events. On the contrary, when I have a party or event, my body is tired and more tired. I prefer to have quiet alone time."
13057,218,1,40,ISFJ,37,<Yes>  I like going to art galleries. I like going to art galleries with my daughter or close acquaintances. I also like to work outdoors with nature.
13058,218,1,40,ISFJ,38,"<no>  I seem to understand other people's feelings well. When someone else tells me something, I can feel why they are saying it and how they feel. I share difficulties with the church deacons and pray for each other. Even though it's not my prayer, I know how difficult it is to understand the deacon's situation so well, so I cry when I pray."
13059,218,1,40,ISFJ,39,"<no>  I don't plan what to do every day. As a housewife, there are not many new things to plan and do."
13060,218,1,40,ISFJ,40,"<no>  I felt a lot of insecurity. I guess it's an innate tendency. What if my husband gets sick, what if our house goes bankrupt? I was worried about the little things of the children and it was hard. I met God and now I feel much better."
13061,218,1,40,ISFJ,41,"<Yes>  I want to avoid talking on the phone. My family likes to talk. But in other cases, KakaoTalk or email is more convenient than phone calls. You can organize your thoughts and write on KakaoTalk or email, but when it comes to phone calls, you have to answer right away without having to think about what the other person is saying, so there is stress from that."
13062,218,1,40,ISFJ,42,<Yes>  I've spent a lot of time trying to understand people who disagree with me. I can feel the age difference in conversations with children these days. I'm trying to find YouTube to understand children.
13063,218,1,40,ISFJ,43,"<no>  don't contact my friends to meet up first. It's also the reason I don't have many friends, but I'm not the type to contact you first. I think it would be awkward to meet because I haven't been in contact too much."
13064,218,1,40,ISFJ,44,"<Yes>  If my plans go wrong, I try to get back to them. A few months ago I put my house up for sale. Interest rates rose, real estate plunged, and real estate sales froze. So, I changed it to charter instead of selling according to the situation."
13065,218,1,40,ISFJ,45,"<Yes>  I often regret the mistakes I made a long time ago. My children are college students now, and they talked about how they were hurt by me when they were in puberty. I thought I was a good mother, but I felt so sorry for my children because I did something that left a lifelong trauma. If I go back to that time, I regret that I would never have said or acted like that."
13066,218,1,40,ISFJ,46,"<no>  I think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. As a Christian, I know why I exist. And thank God I want to live a life that pleases God and go to the side of the Lord."
13067,218,1,40,ISFJ,47,"<no>  think I'm good at controlling my emotions. Of course, I can get angry or sad depending on the situation around me, but I think I soon find my composure and return to my daily life. My family says that I have more tears than before."
13068,218,1,40,ISFJ,48,"<Yes>  I try to save the other person's face even when it's clear that it's their fault. If it wasn't something that person did on purpose, I feel more sorry for what I said when I get pointed out for my mistakes and get hurt. If the other person thinks it's a mistake, I don't mention it for the other person's sake."
13081,219,1,40,INFP,1,<no>  They do not seek out and make new friends because they prefer to spend time with existing friends rather than new ones.
13082,219,1,40,INFP,2,"<Yes>  Because I have a lot of interest in various fields, I often look for books or videos, but these days I have a lot of interest in space."
13083,219,1,40,INFP,3,"<Yes>  I am good at empathizing with others, so I am easily sympathetic, but I seem to express my feelings through others."
13084,219,1,40,INFP,4,<Yes>  I always think in advance when things go wrong and come up with a contingency plan. Because it's more comfortable.
13085,219,1,40,INFP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. Even during a recent important exam, I didn't feel nervous or nervous."
13086,219,1,40,INFP,6,"<Yes>  I prefer talking to people I already know, rather than introducing myself to new people."
13087,219,1,40,INFP,7,<no>  I prefer to work on multiple projects simultaneously rather than just one. I tend to do several things in turns because I lose interest easily if I do only one thing.
13088,219,1,40,INFP,8,<Yes>  I am very sentimental. This is because there are many things that greatly agree with and are moved by sentimental movies and books.
13089,219,1,40,INFP,9,"<no>  don't like making plans. I didn't enjoy diaries or electronic tools, so I didn't try them."
13090,219,1,40,INFP,10,<no>  A small mistake doesn't make you doubt your abilities. I just hope that you will learn from your mistakes.
13091,219,1,40,INFP,11,"<no>  Talking to someone you're interested in first isn't easy. Usually, when someone else talks to me first, I would start the conversation from there."
13092,219,1,40,INFP,12,<no>  I am interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art. Because it's interesting to hear different people's opinions.
13093,219,1,40,INFP,13,<no>  I tend to follow emotions more than reason. People around me also say that I have a more emotional side.
13094,219,1,40,INFP,14,"<Yes>  like to improvise rather than plan. Depending on the mood of the day, I decide what I want to do today."
13095,219,1,40,INFP,15,<Yes>  I tend not to worry about who I look to others. Because my own thoughts are more important than other people's eyes.
13096,219,1,40,INFP,16,"<no>  I do not enjoy participating in group activities. Even these days, I prefer to work personally."
13097,219,1,40,INFP,17,"<Yes>  I like open endings that you can interpret in your own way. For that reason, I liked the work called Memories of a Murderer."
13098,219,1,40,INFP,18,<Yes>  I feel satisfied when I help others rather than myself. Because it feels more worthwhile.
13099,219,1,40,INFP,19,"<Yes>  have a lot of interests and sometimes I don't know what to do first. Recently, while watching a movie, another interest occurred to me, so I looked for a book."
13100,219,1,40,INFP,20,"<Yes>  I often worry about things going wrong. It's because if you worry in advance, you will be less afraid when the thing shut up."
13101,219,1,40,INFP,21,<Yes>  I would like to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group. I don't think I'm good at stepping up and leading.
13102,219,1,40,INFP,22,<no>  I think I have a lot of artistic inclinations. This is because they are interested in and enjoy art and music.
13103,219,1,40,INFP,23,"<no>  I don't think a world that values reason over emotion is better. This is because there are many things that can be understood only with reason, and human life eventually requires emotional understanding."
13104,219,1,40,INFP,24,"<no> When I need a break, I tend to take a break first rather than doing housework first. It's because you can do housework better because you have strength."
13105,219,1,40,INFP,25,"<Yes>  It's interesting to see other people's arguments. Because I can learn something new from the conflict of opinions, and I can act as a moderator."
13106,219,1,40,INFP,26,<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. It's because I don't really like the way other people look at me.
13107,219,1,40,INFP,27,"<Yes>  My emotions tend to change very quickly. Often times, even when you feel good, you quickly become depressed."
13108,219,1,40,INFP,28,<no>  I don't get annoyed with people who are less efficient than me. It's good because in that case I can give you some advice.
13109,219,1,40,INFP,29,"<Yes>  I often put things off until the end. This is because the tighter the time, the better the focus and the greater the efficiency of the time."
13110,219,1,40,INFP,30,"<Yes>  I think the question of the afterlife is interesting. Because I am interested in the invisible world, I am also interested in the afterlife."
13111,219,1,40,INFP,31,"<no>  I prefer to be alone than to be with other people. Even these days, spending time alone is more comfortable and good."
13112,219,1,40,INFP,32,<no>  am interested in theory-based discussions. I have also participated in seminars on fundamental and philosophical topics.
13113,219,1,40,INFP,33,<Yes>  I can easily empathize with people from completely different backgrounds than mine. Because we value and respect the thoughts and experiences of others.
13114,219,1,40,INFP,34,<Yes>  I tend to postpone making decisions until the end. It takes a lot of time because we try to make decisions as carefully as possible.
13115,219,1,40,INFP,35,<Yes>  I tend not to reconsider decisions I have already made. I don't think about anything else because I can't easily change a decision I've made.
13116,219,1,40,INFP,36,"<no>  I tend to enjoy alone time rather than fun parties or events. Even these days, I prefer to enjoy quiet alone time."

13118,219,1,40,INFP,38,"<no>  I rarely have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. However, in some cases, it is difficult to understand people who act in ways that cause harm to others, especially those who talk loudly in public places."
13119,219,1,40,INFP,39,<no>  I don't like to plan my daily to-dos. It's because it's more efficient to do it when you want to than according to the plan.
13120,219,1,40,INFP,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. I tend to worry a lot about the future, so I often feel anxious."
13121,219,1,40,INFP,41,<Yes>  I would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. I prefer to talk to people face-to-face rather than talking on the phone.
13122,219,1,40,INFP,42,<Yes>  spend a lot of time trying to understand people who disagree with me very much. I have a lot of such experiences to understand my parents-in-law after getting married.
13123,219,1,40,INFP,43,<no>  I don't usually contact my friends to meet up first. I usually wait for my friends to contact me first.
13124,219,1,40,INFP,44,"<no> If my plans go wrong, I tend to revise my plans rather than try to get back to them as quickly as possible. Recently, while preparing for a certification exam, there was a schedule disruption, so I had to revise my plans."
13125,219,1,40,INFP,45,<no>  I don't often regret the mistakes I made long ago. It's because it's important to move forward rather than regret the past.
13126,219,1,40,INFP,46,<no>  tend to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. Because I have always been very interested in human existence and the nature of life.
13127,219,1,40,INFP,47,<Yes>  I tend to be swayed by my emotions rather than controlling them. People around me often say that I am on the emotional side.
13128,219,1,40,INFP,48,"<Yes> Even when it's obvious that it's the other person's fault, I tend to try to save the other person's face. Anyone can make mistakes, so I don't think you should lose face because of it."
13141,220,1,30,ENFJ,1,"<neutrality>  I don't intentionally join or join a group, but I do make new connections when the grade or semester changes because I have children."
13142,220,1,30,ENFJ,2,"<Yes>  These days, I started to believe, so I often look for related videos or articles and think deeply."
13143,220,1,30,ENFJ,3,"<neutrality>  When someone else is crying, I sometimes shed tears when I sympathize with them by hearing about the reason rather than how they look."
13144,220,1,30,ENFJ,4,"<Yes>  I am a person with a lot of worries and a lot of fear of failure, so I am a person who makes various preparations and tries not to fail as much as possible."
13145,220,1,30,ENFJ,5,"<Yes>  try very hard to keep my composure. This is because when you get excited, the probability of failure increases, so it is the personality that wants to see and solve the situation as rationally and objectively as possible."
13146,220,1,30,ENFJ,6,"<neutrality>  I like talking to people. However, there are many cases that do not approach first depending on the condition. As you get older, you may feel that you lack the energy to focus on new people."
13147,220,1,30,ENFJ,7,"<no> I'm the type of person who does many things at once. I don't think the achievement is high if I do it one by one, so if there is something that can be done together, I tend to do it at the same time."
13148,220,1,30,ENFJ,8,"<neutrality>  I think I have a lot of emotional parts in my own way, but my acquaintances think that I am a rational person. It seems that there are parts that people generally don't like because their eyes are more focused on things they don't like."
13149,220,1,30,ENFJ,9,"<Yes>  like to plan well, follow through and act with fewer failures. Because I have a lot of anxiety, I search and move a lot when I have to improvise."
13150,220,1,30,ENFJ,10,"<Yes>  I believe that people should always learn and be humble. I know, but I think I could be wrong even at that moment, so I tend to doubt and check."
13151,220,1,30,ENFJ,11,"<Yes>  I don't think there's any reason why it's difficult to approach, greet, and talk first."
13152,220,1,30,ENFJ,12,<no>  I like to be exposed to new knowledge. I love to discuss and listen to things I don't know.
13153,220,1,30,ENFJ,13,"<Yes>  I think there are more things that shouldn't be judged emotionally. I can't reject it unconditionally, but there are many times when it's beneficial to think and judge rationally, so I tend to do that, and my acquaintances evaluate me that way."
13154,220,1,30,ENFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I often make plans and move, but there are also times when I improvise and act. In that case, there are many cases like that when I move alone because I don't have an appointment with someone else."
13155,220,1,30,ENFJ,15,"<no>  I am a person who cares about how people see me. In the past, if I thought it would be enough if I didn't see it, now as a parent with a child, I try to show the right side and act right."
13156,220,1,30,ENFJ,16,"<Yes>  It's because there are many fun things to do when many people do something, and it's because I get energy when I'm with many people."
13157,220,1,30,ENFJ,17,<no>  I like things with a fixed ending. This is because there are many cases where movies or books that allow the ending to be interpreted by each person do not end in a disgusting and refreshing way. Suriname was fun these days.
13158,220,1,30,ENFJ,18,<Yes>  I am a selfless person. I am very proud to be of help to others. It's because I feel satisfied when I help someone and that person can change and bring better results.
13159,220,1,30,ENFJ,19,"<no>  Because I don't have very many interests right now. There aren't many, so I've never had a hard time choosing."
13160,220,1,30,ENFJ,20,"<Yes>  I don't have many failures, so I have that fear. So, I tend to come up with a lot of countermeasures and alternatives."
13161,220,1,30,ENFJ,21,<Yes>  I prefer the one closest to me who makes the work subjective rather than the decision maker. It's good to be in a position where you can be moderately responsible and moderately lead.
13162,220,1,30,ENFJ,22,<neutrality>  I didn't get very good grades in the arts and physical education except for physical education.
13163,220,1,30,ENFJ,23,"<no>  am a person who values the rational side more, but I believe that the world cannot be better without emotions. This is because if everything is calculated and only thinking about gains, those who do not receive the benefits will be disregarded, and then they will create a hierarchy, deepen polarization, and cut off the opportunities for the haves to reach those who have not. I believe that we can create a better and better world only when we protect the human side of things."
13164,220,1,30,ENFJ,24,"<no>  I want to finish the housework first, but when my stamina reaches its limit, I tend to rest first and work hard to do the rest."
13165,220,1,30,ENFJ,25,<Yes>  I enjoy sharing various issues with people and gaining new knowledge through it.
13166,220,1,30,ENFJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't like to step out. It requires a lot of energy and a lot of responsibility, but I'm a person who lacks that much."
13167,220,1,30,ENFJ,27,<Yes> I've had many experiences like this while raising children. It's an experience where you feel good and then suddenly get angry and come up.
13168,220,1,30,ENFJ,28,"<Yes>  I like to work efficiently. If you don't know and can't do it, I think you should ask someone who does well and do the job. Don't try alone."
13169,220,1,30,ENFJ,29,"<neutrality>  I want to do it right away if possible, but when I want to give a good answer after thinking enough, I tend to take a long time to produce results."
13170,220,1,30,ENFJ,30,"<Yes>  I am a believer who has just started my faith, so questions about the afterlife are interesting. This is because it is interesting to discuss and talk about the afterlife, even though it is invisible and nobody has seen or created it."
13171,220,1,30,ENFJ,31,"<no>  I get energy and vitality by talking to people these days. Even if not many people, I enjoy going to a nice place and drinking coffee with a few people."
13172,220,1,30,ENFJ,32,<no>  I like to take on new knowledge. People who listen to and converge on the opinions of many people and in the process throw away their existing ideas and develop are fun.
13173,220,1,30,ENFJ,33,<neutrality>  I tend to empathize with people with similar values rather than background.
13174,220,1,30,ENFJ,34,<no>  I tend to make decisions quickly. I haven't changed much because I've been doing it for a long time.
13175,220,1,30,ENFJ,35,"<Yes>  When I make a decision, I don't think about it again. It's because you have to get rid of the past quickly."
13176,220,1,30,ENFJ,36,"<no>  I like to spend time bumping into people, but these days, I tend to relieve fatigue by talking to a few people."
13177,220,1,30,ENFJ,37,"<Yes>  I don't know much about art, but I think these experiences develop me, so I try to go when I get a chance."
13178,220,1,30,ENFJ,38,<no>  I am a person who thinks a lot about and judges other people's feelings. I try to understand the person by thinking about why I act like that and why I talk like that.
13179,220,1,30,ENFJ,39,"<neutrality>  It's not because I don't have enough work to plan every day, and sometimes I set a daily routine and move when necessary."
13180,220,1,30,ENFJ,40,"<no>  always have insecurities, but I don't try to show them off. Always prepare multiple alternatives to overcome anxiety."
13181,220,1,30,ENFJ,41,"<no>  I like the convenience of the phone. When working, there are many things that can be solved immediately over the phone."
13182,220,1,30,ENFJ,42,<Yes>  I like hearing other people's opinions. Because my opinion is not the law.
13183,220,1,30,ENFJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to go first. If the case that the other person seeks me first disappears too much, then I will distance myself."
13184,220,1,30,ENFJ,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, we try to deal with it quickly with other alternatives. The process is important, but so is the outcome, so you can't stick to just one method."
13185,220,1,30,ENFJ,45,"<Yes>  I can't make the past something that never happened, so it's okay if it only happened to me, but if I made other people worried or made it difficult, I will always think about it and regret it."
13186,220,1,30,ENFJ,46,"<no>  If the reason for human life is to have no hope, we lose the driving force to live diligently, so we tend to think about it all the time and tell others to think about it."
13187,220,1,30,ENFJ,47,<no>  I tend to control my emotions. There was a time when my spouse evaluated me as being cold. I have a strong will to see and judge the situation objectively.
13188,220,1,30,ENFJ,48,"<Yes> You should know what the other person did wrong, but I don't think it's necessary to reveal it unless you've caused a lot of harm to others."
13201,221,0,40,ISFJ,1,"<no>  I don't make new friends on a regular basis. The reason is that it is getting harder and harder to meet friends who have been dating before as they get married and start a family, but there is no time and mental space to meet new friends."
13202,221,0,40,ISFJ,2,"<Yes>  I spend a lot of time in the field I am interested in these days. These days, there is a lot of interest in YouTube creators. Start a channel, edit video, develop content and spend time learning how to operate your drone."
13203,221,0,40,ISFJ,3,<Yes>  often want to cry when I see people who express their love for their family with tears. It makes me think of my family and I feel more sorry for not being good to them.
13204,221,0,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  I am well prepared for emergencies. The reason is that I had a failure experience in my 20s because I was not well prepared when things went wrong. After that, I try to make a second and third plan."
13205,221,0,40,ISFJ,5,"<neutrality>  I always try to keep my composure even in difficult situations, but sometimes it's hard to stay calm because I get excited or under a lot of stress. Recently, the work contact with the person in charge of the prime contractor was not smooth, and the mental pressure was severe due to the unreasonable demands related to the work, and the resulting insomnia lasted for a long time."
13206,221,0,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  I am reluctant to make new acquaintances at events. The reason is that once you have a relationship, you want that relationship to continue, so it is inconvenient to meet someone new and introduce yourself."
13207,221,0,40,ISFJ,7,"<neutrality> It depends. I sometimes work on several projects because I have to do more than one job for financial gain, but when I am preparing a presentation in front of many people or studying separately to improve my work, I tend to focus on one. ."
13208,221,0,40,ISFJ,8,"<neutrality>  It depends. The reason is that as I get older, I tend to watch dramas of my taste or empathize with the stories of people around me, but I am very rational when working."
13209,221,0,40,ISFJ,9,"<Yes>  tend to plan well, even if things don't go as planned, whether it's work, study, or travel. Schedules are always displayed on the calendar."
13210,221,0,40,ISFJ,10,"<neutrality>  I don't necessarily think so, but once I couldn't believe myself. There was a time when I found a typo in the conference event booklet on the day of the event, causing great confusion."
13211,221,0,40,ISFJ,11,"<no>  have a hard time getting to know people. There was a time when I mustered up the courage to try to talk first, but many people's reactions weren't that good, so I don't approach people first."
13212,221,0,40,ISFJ,12,"<Yes>  think it's natural for people to have different opinions, but I don't have the heart to discuss different opinions. The reason is that I am not interested in letting people know what I have given meaning to art works, and I respect other people's interpretations, but I do not have much desire to know them, and I do not want to argue about them."
13213,221,0,40,ISFJ,13,"<neutrality> My feelings are not very biased and depend on the situation. Emotional when doing hobbies and rational when working and financial relationships with people. Family members seem to view it emotionally, and others seem to view it rationally."
13214,221,0,40,ISFJ,14,"<no>  I hate improvisation. I have experienced that it is difficult to deal with variables when a variable occurs while working improvisedly, and results are not as good compared to when I planned."
13215,221,0,40,ISFJ,15,"<Yes>  I don't care or worry about how others evaluate me. The reason is that people's subjective evaluations of me can all be different, and any evaluation respects and acknowledges other opinions, and the bigger reason is that it doesn't have a big impact on my life."
13216,221,0,40,ISFJ,16,"<no>  am not very interested in group activities. These days, I am interested in YouTube creators and spend my time watching dramas."
13217,221,0,40,ISFJ,17,<no>  I hate books and movies that leave it up to the reader to see the ending. I like works that predict the ending of good and punish evil rather than the result of a dramatic reversal.
13218,221,0,40,ISFJ,18,<no>  think it's realistically difficult to help others succeed without my own success. The reason is because I think it is more valuable to me to provide the driving force for my family to live well through my own success than helping others succeed.
13219,221,0,40,ISFJ,19,"<no>  When I have multiple interests, I finish one and focus on the next. Recently, I couldn't watch the drama I wanted to watch for several months, but after acquiring some knowledge about YouTube creators, I watched 16 episodes in 4 days."
13220,221,0,40,ISFJ,20,"<no>  I'm not worried about the future. The reason is that if you prepare hard, most of the things you worry about will not come true."
13221,221,0,40,ISFJ,21,<Yes>  I hate being a leader in any group. The reason is that they are not good at leadership and are not interested in being in the spotlight.
13222,221,0,40,ISFJ,22,"<Yes>  don't seem to have any artistic inclinations. The reason is that they are unable to create texts, music, art, etc., do not understand the interpretation of works by critics, and have little experience and interest in viewing works of art."
13223,221,0,40,ISFJ,23,<no>  I don't think so. The reason is because we think that only the balance and harmony of reason and emotion can achieve greater progress.
13224,221,0,40,ISFJ,24,"<Yes>  finish my chores first and then take a break. I tend to do what I don't want to do first and what I want to do later. If you do what you want to do without first doing what you don't want to do, you feel uncomfortable. What I don't like to do is housework and what I want to do is rest."
13225,221,0,40,ISFJ,25,<no>  I'm not very interested in other people's arguments. The reason is that it is expected that the parties to the argument will only fight and not resolve because other people's thoughts are already wrong and only my thoughts are right.
13226,221,0,40,ISFJ,26,"<Yes>  I don't want other people to pay attention to me, and I tend to act that way too. I don't care how other people evaluate me, but I think it's because I don't like being evaluated."
13227,221,0,40,ISFJ,27,"<neutrality> It depends. I always try to keep my composure in words and actions, but sometimes when I'm driving I find myself turning into a fiery personality when I feel physically threatened by another vehicle."
13228,221,0,40,ISFJ,28,"<neutrality>  I don't care about people who don't have much to do with me, but sometimes I get annoyed when people who are closely related to my work don't do their job efficiently."
13229,221,0,40,ISFJ,29,"<no>  feel comfortable when I finish what I have to do first. I seem to have developed this habit since my military days. Even lately, I always keep this habit."
13230,221,0,40,ISFJ,30,<no>  I am not interested in questions about the afterlife. The reason is that I don't think there is an afterlife itself.
13231,221,0,40,ISFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I like my time alone, but I also like and value spending time with my family. These days, I'm trying to travel more with my family."
13232,221,0,40,ISFJ,32,"<Yes>  I'm not interested in discussing with others whether it's theory or principle. Rather than the positive function of persuading the other party with the logic of the debater and adjusting their opinions, I have seen more dysfunctions where my opinion is right and other people's opinions are not right."
13233,221,0,40,ISFJ,33,"<no>  I can't sympathize. In high school, the children of chaebol families went to school together. At that time, we were close because we were in the same class, but as time passed, I experienced meeting people with similar backgrounds, so I thought it was very difficult to understand what each of us hadn't experienced."
13234,221,0,40,ISFJ,34,"<Yes>  hesitate to make a decision until the end. When I have to choose and make a decision among many options, I tend to make my final decision because I carefully weigh the benefits, opportunity costs, and pros and cons."
13235,221,0,40,ISFJ,35,"<Yes>  Once I make a decision, I tend not to worry about it afterward. The reason is that you don't regret it, you can't go back, and you think about it before making a decision."
13236,221,0,40,ISFJ,36,"<neutrality>  I like spending time alone and I don't like partying, but I also like to end the week with a good meal with my family. These days, family members work together to relieve mental fatigue while looking at a clean house through house cleaning."
13237,221,0,40,ISFJ,37,"<no>  don't like going to art galleries. To appreciate art works such as art galleries, they do not have basic knowledge in the field and do not have an eye for art, so they rarely go to places where they are displayed."
13238,221,0,40,ISFJ,38,<no>  I always tend to acknowledge the other person's emotional state because they are different from me.
13239,221,0,40,ISFJ,39,"<neutrality>  I love to make plans, but I prefer yearly, monthly, and weekly plans rather than daily to-dos."
13240,221,0,40,ISFJ,40,"<no>  I have concerns about my health these days. Ever since I felt tremendous pain from a major illness 10 years ago, I always feel uneasy about not being healthy."
13241,221,0,40,ISFJ,41,<no>  I don't feel pressured to make phone calls. Most of the people I talk to on the phone rather than on messenger are close friends and it's a great comfort when the call ends.
13242,221,0,40,ISFJ,42,<no>  I tend to respect other people's opinions. It doesn't take time to understand because I think it's so natural that other people's thoughts and opinions are different from mine.
13243,221,0,40,ISFJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends first. The older I get, the harder it is to meet friends."
13244,221,0,40,ISFJ,44,"<no>  If my plan goes wrong, I will work on another plan. There was an area I wanted to go on vacation, but the trip was canceled due to local circumstances, so I modified my plan and went on vacation to the second destination I thought of."
13245,221,0,40,ISFJ,45,<no>  I don't regret my old mistakes. But I'm trying hard not to repeat it.
13246,221,0,40,ISFJ,46,<Yes>  I don't think deeply about it. The reason is that the reality of living and living every day is not easy and there is no time to think about human existence itself because we are working hard on the given life itself.
13247,221,0,40,ISFJ,47,"<no> I'm not good at expressing emotions. I don't like having my feelings read by others, and the degree to which I like people is different, but I try not to express them differently and treat them with the same feelings. People around me sometimes view me coldly."
13248,221,0,40,ISFJ,48,"<neutrality> Unlike when I felt the other person's fault was careless or intentional, I try to save face when it's a mistake. The reason is that when someone makes a mistake, saving face and giving encouragement is the driving force for not making the same mistake and working with confidence."
13261,222,1,30,ESFP,1,"<neutrality>  I don't try to make new friends, but I don't reject people who come. The reason is that I don't hate new friends, but I don't think it's necessary to make them."
13262,222,1,30,ESFP,2,"<Yes>  I tend to be curious about various interests. These days, people are interested in a side job or financial technology that is of great interest."
13263,222,1,30,ESFP,3,"<Yes>  I do that a lot of the time. When I see other people sad, my heart hurts too much and I tend to have trouble holding back my tears."
13264,222,1,30,ESFP,4,"<neutrality>  I tend to think of countermeasures depending on what happens at that time. I tend to worry a lot, but I think I can't make preparations for everything, so I think I only make one or two things about important things."
13265,222,1,30,ESFP,5,"<no>  I'm weak against stress, so when the pressure gets worse, it first shows up on my face, so it's hard to hide it."
13266,222,1,30,ESFP,6,"<Yes>  I think it's more comfortable with people I already know than new people, so I try to find a point of contact with new people after talking to people I know first."
13267,222,1,30,ESFP,7,"<no>  I have a lot of interest here and there, and my concentration is low, so I can't concentrate on one thing and finish it well, so I move on to another job and start it."
13268,222,1,30,ESFP,8,"<neutrality>  try to be rational when I have to be rational, but sometimes I get sentimental about people or certain things."
13269,222,1,30,ESFP,9,"<no>  I try to make plans, but I've never bought a diary and never went beyond 10 pages."
13270,222,1,30,ESFP,10,"<neutrality>  I blame my ability and knowledge for mistakes that harm others, but I try to coolly pass over mistakes that harm only myself, unless they are major mistakes."
13271,222,1,30,ESFP,11,"<neutrality>  It is not easy to start a conversation if you are interested in a person who is interested in you rationally, and if you are interested in a person as a person, you can easily approach and have a conversation."
13272,222,1,30,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  Each person who evaluates a work of art has a different value and feeling, and I can share it, but I don't want to discuss it, I just accept it."
13273,222,1,30,ESFP,13,"<neutrality>  I think I tend to try to follow reason rather than emotion, but there seems to be more opinions that the evaluations around me are emotional and impulsive."
13274,222,1,30,ESFP,14,"<neutrality>  In the past, I tended to improvise everything, but now, when I have work to do, I tend to improvise after I have done everything I have to do. And it seems that my daily routine changes a lot depending on how I feel that day."
13275,222,1,30,ESFP,15,"<no>  I place great importance on the opinions of others, and tend to pay attention to people's opinions. The results of the career interest test also came out like that."
13276,222,1,30,ESFP,16,"<Yes>  First of all, I like social gatherings, and I value a sense of belonging, so I feel comfortable when I belong somewhere."
13277,222,1,30,ESFP,17,<neutrality>  I tend not to think too much about works that allow me to interpret the ending in my own way.
13278,222,1,30,ESFP,18,"<neutrality>  There is certainly satisfaction in helping others succeed. That satisfaction is probably a desire for recognition. However, it seems that I have a greater desire to succeed and be recognized."
13279,222,1,30,ESFP,19,"<Yes>  I tend to be interested in various things, and I'm the type to get bored easily, so there are times when I'm trying so many things that I don't know what to do."
13280,222,1,30,ESFP,20,"<Yes>  I tend to worry a lot. I've had that kind of personality before, but the special occasion is that I tasted failure while preparing for the civil service exam for a long time, and it was not easy to find a job."
13281,222,1,30,ESFP,21,"<neutrality>  I think I want to avoid positions where I am tired and responsible as much as possible, but I always play a leadership role after time, so I chose neutral."
13282,222,1,30,ESFP,22,"<no>  I don't have artistic inclinations like art, but I'm still doing vocal activities as a hobby, and I'm interested in musical art."
13283,222,1,30,ESFP,23,"<neutrality>  Of course, I think that there can be bad things because they are emotional, but I think it could be a colder world if there were no emotions because I only thought too rationally."
13284,222,1,30,ESFP,24,"<no>  First of all, I can do housework when my body is in good condition, and I think these things are also greatly influenced by my mood that day."
13285,222,1,30,ESFP,25,"<no>  I don't necessarily enjoy watching people fight, I just think that people can have different thoughts as they go through life, so I think we should fully acknowledge that and adjust the parts that need to be adjusted."
13286,222,1,30,ESFP,26,"<neutrality>  At gatherings with a lot of close friends, I like to be the center of attention, so I seem to lead the most noisily, but at gatherings with a lot of people I don't know, I don't bother trying to get attention."
13287,222,1,30,ESFP,27,"<Yes>  I have a lot of emotional ups and downs. I'm in a relationship, and there are many times when I feel that my mood changes 180 degrees from good to bad with each word of that person."
13288,222,1,30,ESFP,28,"<neutrality>  I tend not to be very involved with people who are not related to me, but I tend to get angry when people I work with are frustrated. Even recently, I was annoyed by the way people were doing their job, and I thought, 'I'm going to do it'."
13289,222,1,30,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  don't like troublesome things, and I prefer to postpone what needs to be done as much as possible and then do it quickly with maximum concentration. Lately, I tend to cram."
13290,222,1,30,ESFP,30,"<neutrality>  I like movies about the afterlife, but I don't bother looking for them or believing them to be true."
13291,222,1,30,ESFP,31,"<neutrality> When I'm tired of my daily life, I always try to have time for myself, but I can barely last a day and tend to go out to spend time with others."
13292,222,1,30,ESFP,32,"<Yes>  I don't enjoy studying, and I think it's much more efficient to learn by bumping into the body rather than the theory."
13293,222,1,30,ESFP,33,"<Yes>  Each person's environment is different, and it won't be easy for them, but I always try to sympathize with them as much as possible."
13294,222,1,30,ESFP,34,"<Yes>  First of all, I have a lot of worries about making a decision, and I tend to pay attention to people, so I can't push my thoughts well, so I think I make a decision after going through many thoughts."
13295,222,1,30,ESFP,35,"<neutrality>  I tend to try to think that way, but I worry a lot and when something goes wrong, I blame myself a lot and regret it."
13296,222,1,30,ESFP,36,"<Yes>  It seems that attending fun parties and events is much more energizing, unless you are physically exhausted and need to rest at home."
13297,222,1,30,ESFP,37,"<no>  I am not very interested in art, and I am more interested in commercial films than in artistic works."
13298,222,1,30,ESFP,38,"<no>  do sometimes when I see people I really don't understand, but most of the time I try to understand other people's feelings and I'm very understanding."
13299,222,1,30,ESFP,39,"<no>  Rather than getting frustrated when things don't go as planned, I tend to think about what I need to do, set priorities, and do what I can do first."
13300,222,1,30,ESFP,40,<no>  Anxiety is almost always present. It seems that I grew up in a family that was not so harmonious and became something of an unstable personality.
13301,222,1,30,ESFP,41,"<neutrality>  It's great to talk on the phone with someone you like, but I want to avoid first-time deliveries or phone calls to people I don't know."
13302,222,1,30,ESFP,42,"<neutrality>  You spend a lot of time trying to understand when opinions are very different from those you like, but you're either willing to accept or not care too much about the opinions of people you can just skip over."
13303,222,1,30,ESFP,43,"<no>  I don't usually ask to meet someone unless I'm really comfortable with it, but I always get a call from someone asking me to meet up first."
13304,222,1,30,ESFP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, I try to solve it by thinking of another way rather than going back to the original plan."
13305,222,1,30,ESFP,45,"<Yes> As I am in my 30s, there are times when I reminisce about the past, but I think I am regretting the mistakes because I am not what I thought I was in the past."
13306,222,1,30,ESFP,46,"<neutrality>  When depression came, I had thought deeply about human existence and the reason for living for a long time, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt frustrated because there was no answer, so I try not to think about it these days."
13307,222,1,30,ESFP,47,"<Yes> Even if you try to control your emotions, it's not easy, and your daily condition is influenced so much that it is said that it is determined by your mood that day. The evaluation of the surroundings is also similar."
13308,222,1,30,ESFP,48,"<Yes>  Anyone can make mistakes, and as long as the other person shows an attitude of acknowledging it, I think it's better not to make things that make each other frown by giving face to face."
13321,223,1,30,INTP,1,"<no>  Maintaining existing relationships takes a lot of energy, so you don't bother making new friends regularly."
13322,223,1,30,INTP,2,"<neutrality>  It's not a variety of interests, but I tend to spend a lot of time on things that interest me. These days, I have a hobby in painting, so I am looking at a lot of related materials."
13323,223,1,30,INTP,3,"<no>  It may be sad rather than wanting to cry together, but I think the first thing to do is to know the cause and solve it."
13324,223,1,30,INTP,4,<Yes> It's because it's easier to think about how things will go in different directions and count the number of cases than when you didn't think about it.
13325,223,1,30,INTP,5,"<Yes>  I tend to keep my composure because I think the situation where I have to solve the problem is the number one priority, even if I am under a lot of pressure or panicked."
13326,223,1,30,INTP,6,"<Yes>  It's because I'm more comfortable talking to people I already know than talking to new people, and I'm not interested in meeting new people."
13327,223,1,30,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  I tend to focus on one thing I'm not familiar with, get used to it, and then efficiently do several things together."
13328,223,1,30,INTP,8,"<no>  This is because when a problem arises, we think and act that we need to exclude the sentimental part in order to solve the problem."
13329,223,1,30,INTP,9,"<no>  plan roughly, but I don't like making plans, so I always buy a diary and write less than half of it."
13330,223,1,30,INTP,10,"<no>  I made a mistake while working together recently, and when I was pointed out, I thought I should correct it right away rather than doubting my ability or knowledge."
13331,223,1,30,INTP,11,"<no>  There is a difficult part because there is no horse around. In most cases, the other person leads the conversation unless there is a common interest."
13332,223,1,30,INTP,12,"<no>  I am interested in the different interpretations of works such as movies, dramas, and webtoons depending on the viewer's point of view, so I am interested in talking about those parts."
13333,223,1,30,INTP,13,"<Yes>  I tend to follow reason rather than emotion, and people around me evaluate me similarly."
13334,223,1,30,INTP,14,"<Yes>  It is difficult to make a plan and stick to it, but I tend to think about what to do overall and proceed flexibly depending on the situation."
13335,223,1,30,INTP,15,"<Yes>  Since I'm not interested in other people, I think it's more efficient to invest in other things than to spend time trying to meet other people's standards."
13336,223,1,30,INTP,16,"<no>  Not interested at all. I'll do it if necessary, but I'm more comfortable doing it alone."
13337,223,1,30,INTP,17,"<Yes> It's not recent, but my favorite movie is Inception. At the time, the sound of the totem stopping at the end was heard or not. Opinions were divided, but the recent actor's remarks revealed that the ending was real."
13338,223,1,30,INTP,18,"<no>  It's because I feel satisfied with helping others succeed, but when I think I can feel greater satisfaction when I'm not successful, I think my nose is stoned."
13339,223,1,30,INTP,19,"<no>  I don't have that many interests, but I tend to do what I want to do at the time."
13340,223,1,30,INTP,20,"<no>  Rather than worrying, I tend to do my best in the task entrusted with the time to worry. Because I think it's more efficient not to regret."
13341,223,1,30,INTP,21,"<Yes>  As a leader, you inevitably have to interact with people a lot, but meeting people itself is mentally exhausting."
13342,223,1,30,INTP,22,"<neutrality>  I like drawing as a hobby, but I don't seem to have any interest or talent in dressing up."
13343,223,1,30,INTP,23,"<no>  I think it's important to be rational efficiently, but I'm not sure that the absence of emotions will make the world a better place. I don't think either side is absolutely right, so I think there's a balance to be struck."
13344,223,1,30,INTP,24,"<Yes>  prefer to take a break from work. If you have to clean up anyway, it's because you're free from the mind that you have work to do."
13345,223,1,30,INTP,25,"<neutrality>  I don't enjoy arguing, but when I see arguing, I think it's interesting from a different perspective because I can think that opinions can be so different."
13346,223,1,30,INTP,26,"<Yes>  For meetings where seating is required, it is best to sit in the back or in a corner where there is as little attention as possible."
13347,223,1,30,INTP,27,"<no>  There is little change in facial expression, so it is often misunderstood by others. It's fun, but I'm often misunderstood by others that it's not fun."
13348,223,1,30,INTP,28,"<Yes>  When I do housework with my sister, it is frustrating to see that the circulation is not efficient, so I tend to make her work more efficiently."
13349,223,1,30,INTP,29,"<Yes>  tend to do things according to my schedule, but there are parts that I delay as much as possible. Recently, I have a test I want to take, but it's about a month and a half away, so I'm going to start properly now."
13350,223,1,30,INTP,30,"<Yes>  I had the experience of seeing something similar to a ghost when I was young, and everyone dies, and if death is the end, it seems futile. I think it's interesting because I can fantasize about various things because there's nothing definite."
13351,223,1,30,INTP,31,"<no>  These days, I want to spend time alone rather than spending time with other people."
13352,223,1,30,INTP,32,<no>  I think it's interesting rather than boring because each person can say different thoughts in many ways in a principled story.
13353,223,1,30,INTP,33,"<neutrality>  Rather than empathy, I usually think that that person can be like that as someone who grew up in a different background than me."
13354,223,1,30,INTP,34,"<Yes>  When I make a decision, I tend to make it as quickly as possible if the reason for the decision is clear."
13355,223,1,30,INTP,35,"<Yes>  Even if you think about it again, it's a decision you've already made, and it's more efficient to do other things at that time."
13356,223,1,30,INTP,36,"<no>  Meeting other people itself is a task that requires energy, so these days I tend to relieve fatigue by spending time alone."
13357,223,1,30,INTP,37,<Yes>  It's also fun to see what the person who created it filled it with while appreciating a work of art.
13358,223,1,30,INTP,38,"<neutrality>  I understand how you feel when your friend goes through something bad, but it's more important to point you in the right direction than to understand your feelings."
13359,223,1,30,INTP,39,<no>  I don't like planning. I tend to set rough to-dos on a weekly or monthly basis and proceed flexibly depending on the circumstances.
13360,223,1,30,INTP,40,<Yes> There seems to be an innate tendency. I think it's because I think that people live there anyway.
13361,223,1,30,INTP,41,<Yes>  Because I think a text is more accurate than a phone call and can give you enough thought and communication. It's easy to check again later.
13362,223,1,30,INTP,42,"<neutrality>  I respect very different opinions, but tend to ignore opinions that are asserted out of ignorance."
13363,223,1,30,INTP,43,<no>  I'm not the type to contact you to meet first because I feel more bothered by the promise than the pleasure of meeting.
13364,223,1,30,INTP,44,"<Yes>  While studying and progressing the project, the project took longer than expected, so I tried to proceed as planned as much as possible."
13365,223,1,30,INTP,45,"<no> I'm the type of person who doesn't want to regret it, and there's no guarantee that I won't make that mistake even if I go back, so I try not to regret it with the mindset of wanting to just live with the flow."
13366,223,1,30,INTP,46,<no>  It's one of the things I always think about. I also tend to think about how to exist because life and death are a situation that will be attacked by force majeure now and in the future.
13367,223,1,30,INTP,47,<no>  think I tend to control my emotions rather than being swayed by them. It is evaluated similarly by those around you.
13368,223,1,30,INTP,48,"<neutrality>  It's not malicious, but I'm the type of person who doesn't blame mistakes and tries to move on. Because anyone can make mistakes."
13381,224,1,20,ENTP,1,"<Yes> It's good to keep playing with existing friends, but I tend to try to make new friends regularly. I can have more diverse experiences when I make new friends, and I can grow because of those experiences."
13382,224,1,20,ENTP,2,"<Yes>  My interests are very wide and diverse. There are so many things I want to know about social issues, k-pop, history, etc. It takes a lot of time to explore."
13383,224,1,20,ENTP,3,"<neutrality> If that person is really close to me or if the reason why that person cries has something to do with me, I think tears come out too. But if it's the reason I can't relate, the tears won't come out."
13384,224,1,20,ENTP,4,"<neutrality>  I tend to think that if this thing goes wrong this way, I can do it this way. However, I don't make plans for every situation, and when a situation comes up, I'm supposed to find a way somehow, so I'm not the type to make it."
13385,224,1,20,ENTP,5,"<Yes>  Even when there is a lot of pressure, if I have to do something, I try to control my mind. I recently had an interview for a contest, and when I was asked a question about a problem with my team's proposal, I was taken aback, but I thought of a quick answer in my head without showing off, so I calmly answered the interviewer."
13386,224,1,20,ENTP,6,"<no>  I think of parties and events as places to go to meet new people. If you know someone, you can enjoy it comfortably, but I like making new friends, so I'll go ahead and introduce myself."
13387,224,1,20,ENTP,7,"<no>  am extremely lacking in persistence and lack of concentration. So no matter what project I'm working on, I take on another project, and when I get tired of it, I take on another project. When I study for an exam, I study one subject and when I get bored, I study another subject."
13388,224,1,20,ENTP,8,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation and incident. If it's something I'm interested in and sympathize with, I'm sentimental, but I'm not very agitated about other things. And I don't like being overly sentimental."
13389,224,1,20,ENTP,9,"<no>  Write down the things you must remember on the calendar app so you don't forget them. But I don't like making plans. I'm not the type to go according to plan, and my daily life that goes according to plan is too cramped and not fun."
13390,224,1,20,ENTP,10,"<Yes> It is unacceptable for me to show my mistakes to others. There are times when I often make mistakes in spelling or English spelling in my daily life, but in those cases, I always check before sending it to someone. Even if it's a small mistake and it's wrong, I can just send the message, but mistakes are unacceptable, so when I'm confused, I always have doubts and check again. Also, after a discussion or presentation, if you make a mistake or do not speak smoothly, think about what you lack and always take time to reflect."
13391,224,1,20,ENTP,11,"<Yes>  can't stand being stuffy, so if there's someone I'm interested in, I'm the type to approach and talk to them first. In every group, whenever there was someone I wanted to get close to, I always approached them first and started a conversation."
13392,224,1,20,ENTP,12,"<no> After seeing a work of art, I am the type of person who has to express my thoughts somewhere. If you don't have a conversation partner, you can record somewhere alone, and if you have someone you see together, I think it's essential to talk about your thoughts and listen to that person's thoughts and discuss them. Even if you see a single work, each person interprets it differently, so the process of sharing your thoughts is so fun and helps to broaden your thoughts."
13393,224,1,20,ENTP,13,"<Yes> My judgment is the same as the evaluation of the people around me. I think it's right to follow reason because there's a high chance that you'll regret it later if your emotions take precedence over reason, and I try to act that way."
13394,224,1,20,ENTP,14,"<Yes>  I don't like to plan my day. Living according to a planned plan is cramped and predictable, so it's not fun. You never know where or when the situation will change, so it's good to be flexible and improvise accordingly."
13395,224,1,20,ENTP,15,"<neutrality>  I tend not to care what other people see me as. I don't want to care about other people at all about things like how I dress or what electronics I carry. However, I pay attention to the part where my ability or level is judged. I pay attention to mistakes in spelling and common sense because I'm afraid I'll be seen as an idiot."
13396,224,1,20,ENTP,16,"<Yes>  I don't like to indulge in group activities. In group activities, I think that there are always things I can learn from meeting and having conversations with various people, so I try not to fall into group activities these days."
13397,224,1,20,ENTP,17,"<Yes>  like clear endings, but I really like open endings. Being able to interpret it in my own way is the best, and it's because I can create various interpretations while listening to other people's thoughts. For that reason, I really like the movie The Wailing."
13398,224,1,20,ENTP,18,"<neutrality>  It is very proud and heartwarming to see others succeed through my sacrifice. However, I don't think I feel completely satisfied because I feel envious and rewarded after that."
13399,224,1,20,ENTP,19,"<Yes>  My interests are so wide and diverse. So even when watching YouTube, it is often difficult to decide which video you want to watch because the range of the algorithm is so wide."
13400,224,1,20,ENTP,20,"<no>  Marlowe worries about what will happen if things go wrong. But in my heart, I believe that everything will work out because I have a strong ability to believe in myself. I guess that's why I have so much pride."
13401,224,1,20,ENTP,21,"<Yes>  I prefer the role of a second person rather than a leader role. I don't have any pressure because I don't wear a combat coat, but I think it's more comfortable and nice to have a seat next to the leader where I can express my opinion."
13402,224,1,20,ENTP,22,"<neutrality>  I have very little aesthetic sense. So even if I go to an art gallery, I don't have any interest in it, and I can't draw well. However, I don't think I have a lot of interest and talent in other fields of art."
13403,224,1,20,ENTP,23,"<Yes>  I think it's a natural thing to say. When emotions take precedence, people instantly make wrong judgments. A lot of crimes happen that way. Emotions are sometimes important, but if you look at the current world, emotions take precedence and many people suffer. The world should be a little more rational."
13404,224,1,20,ENTP,24,"<no>  need to rest so I have the energy to do housework. It's good to finish the housework first, but if you need a break, it's better to start working after enough rest."
13405,224,1,20,ENTP,25,<Yes>  I think it's interesting to hear different people's opinions and that's important to me. You can't grow if you don't listen to other people's opinions.
13406,224,1,20,ENTP,26,"<neutrality>  never want to draw attention in a place with too many people. But it's not bad to get attention in a place where there are enough people. Too much attention is burdensome, but I think it's because I like receiving attention."
13407,224,1,20,ENTP,27,"<neutrality>  Emotions change quickly. But when I feel a certain emotion, I think about why I feel that emotion, come to a conclusion, and come back. So change is fast, but the speed of coming back is also fast."
13408,224,1,20,ENTP,28,"<Yes>  Because efficiency is important, I don't understand and get annoyed when I see people who are less efficient than me. I often experience it in my daily life, such as people who have a way to go faster but go around, or people who use tools that can be processed faster but do not use them."
13409,224,1,20,ENTP,29,"<Yes>  do everything when the fire goes down on my feet. Due to my personality, sometimes I can't do it in advance, and the result of the work I did was good, so I postpone it as much as possible until recently and focus on the work later."
13410,224,1,20,ENTP,30,"<Yes>  No one has ever been there or seen it, so it's very interesting to be able to guess and create it to your heart's content. It's really fun to hear that because everyone else has a different opinion."
13411,224,1,20,ENTP,31,"<neutrality> The time I spend alone and the time I spend with others are both important. I like spending time with others, but I also need time alone. I think it's half and half these days."
13412,224,1,20,ENTP,32,"<no>  I think the discussion proceeds based on theory. In order to have a discussion, you need a theory, and then you have to come up with a principled story. Therefore, I like discussions, so I like to talk theoretically and in principle. Even when I have light discussions with my family in everyday life, I talk about theories."
13413,224,1,20,ENTP,33,"<neutrality>  Even if we live in different backgrounds, there are sections where we feel similar as human beings. However, I think it is difficult to narrow the distance that arises from the difference in background. When talking to friends from different economic backgrounds, I can sympathize with them because they are of the same age, but I cannot relate to the difference in background."
13414,224,1,20,ENTP,34,<Yes>  don't make decisions easily and I tend to make them after a lot of research. I thoroughly examine and decide what is more efficient and helpful to me.
13415,224,1,20,ENTP,35,"<neutrality>  When I regret a decision, I tend to think again. But it's a decision that's already been made, so even if you think about it again, nothing will change. So even if I think about it, I tend to try to forget it."
13416,224,1,20,ENTP,36,"<neutrality> Relieve fatigue by yourself or by partying with others. At a party with others, I think it's good to relieve mental fatigue by talking and sharing concerns, and it's good to relieve physical fatigue when I'm alone."
13417,224,1,20,ENTP,37,"<no>  When I look at a work of art, I don't feel particularly inspired. I think it's because I don't have an aesthetic sense, so I'm not good at it. It's more interesting to experience it than to watch it."
13418,224,1,20,ENTP,38,<neutrality>  Sometimes it's hard to understand other people's feelings. I think it's like that a lot when I'm talking to someone who has the opposite inclination to me. But sometimes it makes sense if I think I am that person and try my best to understand.
13419,224,1,20,ENTP,39,"<no>  only think about what I have to do today, but I don't like making plans. Everything changes according to the situation, and it is comfortable and interesting to move accordingly."
13420,224,1,20,ENTP,40,"<Yes>  Of course, there are times when I feel anxious, but because of my optimistic personality, it doesn't happen often. I think it's because of my tendency to think positively with the confidence that I can do it even if I feel anxious."
13421,224,1,20,ENTP,41,"<no> There's absolutely no reason to avoid it. If there is something I need to call, I tend to call without hesitation. I prefer phone calls because they are faster and more accurate than text messages."
13422,224,1,20,ENTP,42,"<Yes>  I can't stand a situation I don't understand. Even if you have a different opinion than mine, it's not wrong because it's that person's opinion. Even if I refute at first, I listen to the person's point of view and try to understand. If I didn¡¯t understand it in that situation, I go back home and slowly think about it again."
13423,224,1,20,ENTP,43,"<Yes>  I have a personality that needs to meet friends periodically. Each friend has different things they want to do together, so I tend to contact them first to make suggestions."
13424,224,1,20,ENTP,44,"<no>  If there is a setback in the plan, I try to come up with a new plan according to the situation. On a recent trip, I remember quickly making other plans when the rain that I had planned for that day became impossible."
13425,224,1,20,ENTP,45,"<no>  You may regret your mistakes, but it's already in the past, so I think it's good to quickly forget and reflect. And I don't want to push too hard on myself, who was immature at the time, because I think I'll make that choice even if I go back."
13426,224,1,20,ENTP,46,"<no> Every day, I reflect on the reason for human existence and life. Since childhood, I have been curious about where and how humans were born, why they exist, and what life is. And I think finding the answer to that is the reason for the existence of me as a human being."
13427,224,1,20,ENTP,47,"<no>  I try to control my emotions. Looking back at myself in the past when I was swayed by my emotions and ruined the ending, I feel the need to control my emotions, so I try to control them. People around me also say that I control my emotions pretty well."
13428,224,1,20,ENTP,48,"<no>  If the other person's fault is obvious, I don't think there's any reason to save the other person's face. Rather than saving the other person's face, it's more important to tell them exactly what they did wrong."
13441,225,1,20,ESFJ,1,"<neutrality>  I don't make friends out of compulsion, but I don't mind meeting new people."
13442,225,1,20,ESFJ,2,"<neutrality> It's not a wide range of interests, but if there is a field that interests me, I tend to explore it first on YouTube. These days, I made a plan to go to a guitar academy, so I'm watching how to catch guitar chords on YouTube before registering for a guitar academy."
13443,225,1,20,ESFJ,3,"<no>  Rather than wanting to cry together, I tend to think about why I am crying and how to solve the problem."
13444,225,1,20,ESFJ,4,"<Yes> While working, I think about the case where things go wrong moment by moment and make various preparations. That way, when something unexpected happens, you can respond quickly and solve it."
13445,225,1,20,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  Even in a high-pressure environment, I think that it will all pass someday, so I tend to hold on to that moment and keep my composure. There was a situation where I had to give a presentation recently, but I had the experience of completing the task at some point as I concentrated on what I was doing."
13446,225,1,20,ESFJ,6,"<neutrality>  I think I first talked to people I knew, then looked at the situation, approached and talked to new people I was interested in. It's about understanding the situation and then taking action."
13447,225,1,20,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  I prefer to do several things sequentially rather than simultaneously, as I have to fully complete one project so I can focus on other projects."
13448,225,1,20,ESFJ,8,"<no>  I don't think I've ever been sentimental since I was born. I don't cry when I watch a movie, and I don't cry when I read a book."
13449,225,1,20,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  Usually, when making a plan with a computer notepad, think about the tasks to be performed, prioritize them, write them down with the notepad on the computer desktop, check which tasks have been completed and which ones are in progress, and process the work."
13450,225,1,20,ESFJ,10,"<no>  When I make a mistake, I tend to forget bad things quickly, and when I make a mistake, I tend to focus on finding a solution quickly and fixing the mistake."
13451,225,1,20,ESFJ,11,"<Yes> It's not difficult to have a conversation with someone you've never seen before. I'm not sure how we became close in the beginning, but there are many friends who happened to be close, and in the process, there is a division between friends who keep in touch and those who don't, but I don't avoid approaching and talking."
13452,225,1,20,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  To be honest, I'm not very interested. I don't hate looking at works of art, but rather than interpreting and discussing them, I tend to focus on the thoughts I think and judge intuitively at the moment."
13453,225,1,20,ESFJ,13,"<Yes>  If emotions take precedence over rationality, it becomes difficult to make accurate judgments, so rather than prioritize emotions, I tend to try to solve problems based on what I learned from experience first by comparing them to past experiences. People around me often hear that I am like a robot that lacks emotions."
13454,225,1,20,ESFJ,14,<no>  usually draw out my plans for the day in my head before going to bed the night before. Think in advance that you will be doing this in roughly some time and will work out some things.
13455,225,1,20,ESFJ,15,"<Yes>  Rather than thinking about how I look in the eyes of others, I tend to focus on what I am doing now. I live my life and I don't care what other people think."
13456,225,1,20,ESFJ,16,"<neutrality>  I don't go out of my way to participate in group activities, but I tend to do it whenever necessary. For example, I have to go to a guitar academy where I have to meet new people these days, but I haven't had any difficulties."
13457,225,1,20,ESFJ,17,"<no>  like works in which the director has clearly determined the ending. So, when I have an unresolved question after watching a movie, I tend to look for interpretive data through various blogs or Googling. I recently saw a work called Decision to Break Up, so I looked for a lot of interpretation materials."
13458,225,1,20,ESFJ,18,"<no>  First of all, it seems that I feel greater satisfaction from my success. However, I do not like to cause harm to others, so when there is a joint task, I tend to do my best."
13459,225,1,20,ESFJ,19,"<no>  I'm not the type to find new interests. And even if there are several interests, it is comfortable to finish the order of the tasks to be performed and explore the interests."
13460,225,1,20,ESFJ,20,"<no>  To be honest, I don't think I'm the type to spend my time worrying about things that won't happen. Worrying doesn't mean things will work out on their own."
13461,225,1,20,ESFJ,21,"<neutrality>  When I take on a leadership role, I think I have to do it perfectly, so I don't necessarily take the lead. However, when there is no other way or when I feel that there is no one else to take over, I voluntarily take over."
13462,225,1,20,ESFJ,22,"<Yes> To be honest, I seem to have very little artistic inclination. Even if you listen to a good piece of art or a song, it's 'cool'. I think about it, but I don't think I can do various interpretations like others."
13463,225,1,20,ESFJ,23,"<Yes>  Frankly, I think things like crime are caused by emotional problems, except for mental problems like psychopaths and sociopaths. In a world where rationality takes precedence, I think that harming people or stealing things with emotions will drastically decrease."
13464,225,1,20,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  In order to have a complete and comfortable rest, it is better to finish the chores first and then take a break because it is mentally comfortable to finish the work to be done first."
13465,225,1,20,ESFJ,25,"<neutrality>  I enjoy watching debates on topics I care about, but I don't like watching debates I'm not interested in. It's boring."
13466,225,1,20,ESFJ,26,"<neutrality> They want to get the attention of people they care about, but they tend to avoid doing things that would attract attention to people who aren't interested."
13467,225,1,20,ESFJ,27,"<no>  I tend to keep things normal. I'm not easily shaken by other people's reactions, and I tend to forget bad things, so I don't seem to be the type to hold on to good or bad feelings for a long time."
13468,225,1,20,ESFJ,28,<Yes> Sometimes I get frustrated when I see people doing only what they tell me to do at work. Sometimes it's hard to understand why they stick with it when there are sufficiently more efficient ways.
13469,225,1,20,ESFJ,29,"<no>  Rather than putting it off until the end, I tend to prioritize planning according to the deadline and stick to the plan as much as possible."
13470,225,1,20,ESFJ,30,"<no> To be honest, it's hard to focus on living in the real world, but I don't think I have time to live while thinking about the afterlife. No matter what kind of world there is after death, I don't think it's something I would think about in reality."
13471,225,1,20,ESFJ,31,"<neutrality>  I have my own rules, so when I want to rest, I tend to stay at home, but I usually relieve stress or gain energy by being with other people. Even these days."
13472,225,1,20,ESFJ,32,"<neutrality> It also seems to depend on whether this is a concern or not. I enjoy talking to others, but I find it boring to talk about topics that don't interest me."
13473,225,1,20,ESFJ,33,"<no>  It's hard to empathize, to be honest, but you can pretend to empathize. If it's a close friend, I tend to think about it from that friend's point of view as much as possible and then conclude with my own thoughts and tell my opinion."
13474,225,1,20,ESFJ,34,"<neutrality> I'm not the type to procrastinate until the end, but since I'm careful in making decisions, I tend to weigh the number of cases and then make a plan and go all-in."
13475,225,1,20,ESFJ,35,"<Yes>  Rather than changing a decision I've already made, I tend to think about how I can do my job more efficiently in the reality I'm facing."
13476,225,1,20,ESFJ,36,"<neutrality>  When I want to spend time alone, I spend time alone, but one day out of the week, I always gather with friends and talk to relieve fatigue."
13477,225,1,20,ESFJ,37,<neutrality>  I don't mind going to art museums because I like experiencing different things. I enjoyed watching the Picasso exhibition and the Tim Burton exhibition recently.
13478,225,1,20,ESFJ,38,<neutrality>  feel frustrated when I see someone who understands with his head but is caught up in his emotions and is not taking any action. I tend to think it would be nice to do something productive while I'm still like that.
13479,225,1,20,ESFJ,39,"<Yes>  In particular, I think it is more efficient and the way to do the work perfectly by setting priorities and handling urgent tasks first."
13480,225,1,20,ESFJ,40,"<Yes> It seems that there are almost no times when I feel anxious. It seems to be a natural tendency, and since I was young, I have lived with the mindset that this will all be resolved with time."
13481,225,1,20,ESFJ,41,"<neutrality>  I prefer to get things done quickly by making phone calls when necessary, but I don't prefer inefficient phone calls."
13482,225,1,20,ESFJ,42,"<no>  Honestly, rather than understanding about someone who is very different from my opinion, I just thought, 'That person thinks that way. You can think like that.' I tend to pass it on."
13483,225,1,20,ESFJ,43,"<neutrality>  I don't contact friends who are fun and fun to meet first, but I'm not the type to contact acquaintances who have exhausting conversations to meet up."
13484,225,1,20,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  Usually during the exam period, I make a plan for the remaining part and say, 'I should read a few pages and fall asleep.' I tend to think like this, but if I can't keep the plan due to unavoidable circumstances, I tend to keep it even the next day."
13485,225,1,20,ESFJ,45,"<no>  To be honest, I'm not the type to remember every bad thing that happened to me. It's a world where it's difficult to live while remembering only the good things, but I don't think it's necessary to live while remembering the bad things."
13486,225,1,20,ESFJ,46,"<Yes>  don't think you need to think about the reason for existence or life. Rather than philosophical considerations, I tend to focus on the life I am living now. After all, I was born as a human and I have to live as a human."
13487,225,1,20,ESFJ,47,"<no>  Rather than being swayed by emotions, I don't seem to pay much attention to how I feel. Even the evaluations around me are the same to the extent that they call me a robot."
13488,225,1,20,ESFJ,48,"<no> Do I really need to save the other person's face? I made a mistake, but I don't think I need to save face. I think it's better to give you some advice so that you don't repeat the same mistakes."
13501,226,1,40,ISFJ,1,"<no>  I don't know what to say about meeting new people, so I make new friends by chance."
13502,226,1,40,ISFJ,2,<no>  I'd rather be alone and quiet than explore new things.
13503,226,1,40,ISFJ,3,"<Yes> If it's someone close to you, you cry together, and if you're not, you either look away to avoid crying or secretly wipe your tears."
13504,226,1,40,ISFJ,4,"<Yes>  If something goes wrong, if there is a workaround, the work can be done quickly and systematically, so I set up several countermeasures."
13505,226,1,40,ISFJ,5,<Yes>  I thought about how to deal with it calmly when the perpetrator rather cursed and insulted me despite being a victim of a leak in my house.
13506,226,1,40,ISFJ,6,"<Yes>  If you approach a new person first and introduce yourself, you feel uncomfortable because the psychological factors that you need to lead the conversation follow, and having a conversation with someone you already know is convenient because you can start another conversation without any problems even if it is interrupted."
13507,226,1,40,ISFJ,7,"<Yes>  If you do two things at once, you'll lose focus and you won't be able to complete both."
13508,226,1,40,ISFJ,8,<neutrality>  I seem to change a little depending on the situation. We judge whether we should be sentimental or rational in terms of the difference between acquaintances and strangers and the situation.
13509,226,1,40,ISFJ,9,"<no>  I always have one thought that it would be nice to have an organized schedule using a diary while managing my schedule, but in reality, it is difficult to practice like three days and three days."
13510,226,1,40,ISFJ,10,"<Yes>  When the team members know the wrong information due to poor guidance within the team, when announcing the next information, I keep thinking about whether it is wrong information again, and I check several times to see if I should share it or not, and then announce it."
13511,226,1,40,ISFJ,11,"<neutrality>  agonize over whether or not to do it to someone I'm interested in, but if there's someone I'm really interested in and want to date, I'm the type to approach first and tell them the truth about how I want to be close."
13512,226,1,40,ISFJ,12,"<Yes>  Not only do they not have knowledge about art works, but even if they try to learn and feel something, they are too difficult to be interested in."
13513,226,1,40,ISFJ,13,"<Yes> When you do everything with your emotions, your emotions at that time are different, so there is a difference in how you handle things, and you tend to follow principles rather than emotions."
13514,226,1,40,ISFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I plan the things I must do and put them on my schedule, but I improvise the things that don't."
13515,226,1,40,ISFJ,15,"<Yes>  It's because I'm worried about whether every action I do is the right thing to do, and I'm worried about what others think of me and whether I don't think badly of it."
13516,226,1,40,ISFJ,16,"<neutrality>  If it's a group I belong to, I have to participate anyway, so I tend to enjoy it, but I don't intentionally visit the group to join or hang out."
13517,226,1,40,ISFJ,17,"<no>  I accept what I see in the movie as it is, not as I imagine it to be."
13518,226,1,40,ISFJ,18,"<neutrality> When I've done something to help others succeed, the return to me is nothing more than a thank you note or something like that."
13519,226,1,40,ISFJ,19,"<no>  Rather than paying attention to many things, I focus on things I like or focus on one or two things and think or act."
13520,226,1,40,ISFJ,20,"<neutrality> It's not like that when I'm doing something I'm confident in, but I tend to worry about things that I've never done before, but I feel burdened about things that require me to take the lead and take responsibility."
13521,226,1,40,ISFJ,21,"<no>  Taking on the role of a leader in an organization to which I belong is a burden and I feel a certain amount of responsibility, but if it is an organization that needs someone to lead it anyway, I want to be a role that helps everyone by doing it."
13522,226,1,40,ISFJ,22,"<Yes> I'm a mess that I can't control my body, and even when I watch TV, I can't see any decorations around me."
13523,226,1,40,ISFJ,23,"<neutrality>  If people valued rationality rather than emotion, it would be possible to go regularly and straight, but since there is no emotion, there is no affection between people, and it seems that it can be a world where only I think about it."
13524,226,1,40,ISFJ,24,"<no>  At this time, I will do housework after seeing if I want more rest or if it is okay to postpone the break."
13525,226,1,40,ISFJ,25,"<Yes>  This is because each person has a different way of thinking, so I'm curious about what to say and what to do, and I think it's different."
13526,226,1,40,ISFJ,26,<Yes>  I prefer to be quiet rather than attracting attention because my actions have no sense of attracting people.
13527,226,1,40,ISFJ,27,<no>  My emotions don't change very quickly because I calm my thoughts internally when they're about to change quickly.
13528,226,1,40,ISFJ,28,"<neutrality>  I don't get annoyed because everyone has a different disposition, but sometimes I get annoyed when I see someone who is assertive and inefficient."
13529,226,1,40,ISFJ,29,"<Yes>  These days, if your body is hard, there is a case of putting off what you have to do as much as possible."
13530,226,1,40,ISFJ,30,"<Yes> It's something I've never experienced, and even if I experience it in the future, I won't remember it, so it feels interesting when TV (both documentary and drama) airs about the afterlife."
13531,226,1,40,ISFJ,31,"<neutrality>  When I'm resting, being alone is comfortable and healing, but for work, I want to spend a lot of time with other people."
13532,226,1,40,ISFJ,32,"<no>  It is not boring because action based on actual experience follows theory-centered discussion, and it is not boring because the next discussion or action follows only when there is an original theory."
13533,226,1,40,ISFJ,33,"<no>  I heard a lecture about mbti, and I think how can I do that when I hear the story of someone who has a different inclination than me even though I am right."
13534,226,1,40,ISFJ,34,"<neutrality>  When it comes to big things, we make quick decisions, but when there is a conflict about something small, we tend to postpone it until the end because we can't make a decision."
13535,226,1,40,ISFJ,35,"<neutrality>  believe and act when it comes to certain decisions, but I tend to think things through to the end when I think about them and make decisions."
13536,226,1,40,ISFJ,36,"<no>  Fatigue is healed only when it is alone, and it is fun during parties and events, but fatigue cannot be relieved."
13537,226,1,40,ISFJ,37,"<no>  I don't have much knowledge about art, so I don't go to art galleries because I don't know what it is."
13538,226,1,40,ISFJ,38,"<no>  It's not hard because everyone's emotions are different. For example, when a friend who has a different disposition from me gets angry and excited about something trivial, I understand and think that they get angry like that in that situation."
13539,226,1,40,ISFJ,39,"<neutrality>  I plan for business work, but I don't plan for personal work unless it's special."
13540,226,1,40,ISFJ,40,"<neutrality> There are very few times when I feel anxious. It's something I have to do, but I get anxious when something happens that I can't do on my own."
13541,226,1,40,ISFJ,41,"<neutrality>  On a daily basis, I tend to be more active on the phone. However, I would like to avoid phone conversations where I just call and chat for no reason that is personal."
13542,226,1,40,ISFJ,42,"<no>  Just because I have a different opinion, I don't spend a lot of time trying to understand it, I just accept and understand that other opinion."
13543,226,1,40,ISFJ,43,"<no>  I think it's a waste to meet up with friends and chat often, so I tend to meet them when they contact me rather than asking to meet first."
13544,226,1,40,ISFJ,44,"<neutrality> If it's a plan that really needs to be done, I try to get back to it as soon as possible, but if there's a setback, it's okay. I was thinking of doing it tomorrow."
13545,226,1,40,ISFJ,45,"<no>  I do not look back without regret, thinking that it happened because it was not mine because the mistakes I made a long time ago do not come back."
13546,226,1,40,ISFJ,46,"<no>  don't think anything so profoundly philosophical. Even living in reality day by day, time goes by too quickly."
13547,226,1,40,ISFJ,47,"<no>  If I get angry or upset myself, I control myself and try not to show my feelings to the other person. And I often hear that it's cold around me."
13548,226,1,40,ISFJ,48,"<Yes>  Everyone can make mistakes, so I tend to save face so that the other person can think again rather than reprimand them for doing something wrong."
13561,227,1,30,ESFJ,1,<Yes>  I love making new friends and it's fun to talk to and get to know them.
13562,227,1,30,ESFJ,2,"<Yes>  Rather than simply relaxing, I spend a significant portion of my free time exploring various interests, and these days I'm interested in data labeling."
13563,227,1,30,ESFJ,3,"<Yes> When I see other people crying, there are many times when I want to cry too. I quickly empathize and fall into the situation."
13564,227,1,30,ESFJ,4,"<neutrality>  Depending on the situation, I make preparations in case things go wrong, but it doesn't always go as planned, so I tend to react at the moment according to the situation."
13565,227,1,30,ESFJ,5,"<no>  try to keep my composure in a high-pressure environment, but it's not easy. In my recent experience, my in-laws asked me to take responsibility for the ancestral rites, but the pressure of having to do it caused me to have bad reactions from my body, and in the aftermath, I expressed bad feelings to my children and my husband."
13566,227,1,30,ESFJ,6,"<no>  At parties and events, I tend to approach new people first and introduce myself. I like talking to new people."
13567,227,1,30,ESFJ,7,"<no>  tend to start and finish multiple projects at the same time. Recently, in a situation where I had to submit 7 reports to prepare for certification, I had the experience of completing the report at the same time."
13568,227,1,30,ESFJ,8,"<Yes>  It's sentimental. I think I'm sentimental because when something happens, I get immersed in it quickly and get overly sad or easily happy."
13569,227,1,30,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  like making plans. I use a diary to make yearly plans, or recently use a board to plan my schedule and practice accordingly."
13570,227,1,30,ESFJ,10,"<Yes>  tend to doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. Recently, I thought that I have a higher ability to understand the child's mind than other parents when it comes to raising a child. However, as I was raising a child, there were many times when things didn't go my way, and whenever that happened, I doubted whether I was the only one who could do this, and I had an experience that made me reflect."
13571,227,1,30,ESFJ,11,"<Yes>  I love talking to people, so I can easily start a conversation by reaching out to someone I'm interested in. I have an experience of approaching the mother of a friend my child likes first and leading the conversation."
13572,227,1,30,ESFJ,12,"<Yes>  Since people around me have little interest in art, I am also not interested in discussing various interpretations of art."
13573,227,1,30,ESFJ,13,"<no>  I tend to follow my emotions mostly. It's hard to judge rationally when something is extremely exciting. However, when I listen to counseling about my worries, I try to judge rationally, so people around me hear that I am a rational person."
13574,227,1,30,ESFJ,14,"<no>  I like to plan a schedule for the day and put it into practice. Today, while planning and practicing every day, I also plan a schedule for tomorrow."
13575,227,1,30,ESFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to worry about what other people will see me as. Because I value human relationships in my life, I worry about my image seen by others."
13576,227,1,30,ESFJ,16,"<Yes>  enjoy participating in group activities. These days, I'm going camping with my kid's friend's family."
13577,227,1,30,ESFJ,17,"<no>  I prefer a fixed ending rather than a book or movie where I can interpret the ending in my own way. If each interprets in their own way, it can lead to misinterpretation or over-interpretation. So, I like movies with a fixed ending, but recently I like a movie called Hansan, which deals with historical stories."
13578,227,1,30,ESFJ,18,"<Yes>  I think my own success is important, but I feel great satisfaction in helping others succeed because I think that if someone else succeeds because of me, I can also feel satisfaction and be a stimulus."
13579,227,1,30,ESFJ,19,"<Yes>  tend to have a lot of interests. I have a lot of interest in various fields, so I want to do this and that, so there are times when I don't know what to do next. Recently, I started studying because I am interested in childcare teachers, and I am also interested in data labeling, so I am learning it."
13580,227,1,30,ESFJ,20,"<neutrality>  I tend to worry about things going wrong, but even if I do worry, I tend to let go. If you worry about it, you often miss it."
13581,227,1,30,ESFJ,21,<no>  don't shy away from taking on leadership roles in organizations. It's because I think that the leader in a group is a helper to the team members rather than a coercive one.
13582,227,1,30,ESFJ,22,"<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. When decorating the interior of a house, I tend to look for convenience rather than artistry, so I don¡¯t think I have any artistic inclinations."
13583,227,1,30,ESFJ,23,<no>  think that moment would have been a better world if people had valued rationality rather than emotion. But can we really say it's a better world? A decision made without emotion is never a good decision.
13584,227,1,30,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  I try to finish the housework first before taking a break. I can see the chores I have to do, but when I take a break, I don't really feel like I'm resting."
13585,227,1,30,ESFJ,25,<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. I'm curious what other people think.
13586,227,1,30,ESFJ,26,"<no>  I tend to try to get other people's attention. It's because they like to receive attention from others, and at the same time, they can also build relationships."
13587,227,1,30,ESFJ,27,"<Yes>  Emotions change quickly. For example, even if you are extremely excited when you have a fight with your spouse, you can get along quickly if you reconcile."
13588,227,1,30,ESFJ,28,"<Yes>  I tend to get annoyed with people who aren't efficient. It would be efficient if team members were flexible when handling their work at the company, but I tried to follow the orders of my boss, so I barely finished my work on time."
13589,227,1,30,ESFJ,29,"<Yes> There are many times to procrastinate. Recently, I made up my mind to organize the child's closet due to the chilly weather, but I haven't been able to do it yet because there is no set period."
13590,227,1,30,ESFJ,30,<no>  It's not interesting. I don't want to know about the afterlife because I think that human death is death and that is the end.
13591,227,1,30,ESFJ,31,"<Yes>  prefer to spend time with others rather than alone. After the day is over, I look back on my day and end the day quietly, so I try to spend time with other people during my day, but these days, I spend time eating delicious food and chatting with people in the neighborhood."
13592,227,1,30,ESFJ,32,"<Yes>  don't think I'm interested in theory or principled discussion. I did theory and practice while studying for certification, but if the theory was boring and I was busy memorizing it because of the exam, there was something practical about the practice. I also had better memories coming into my head."
13593,227,1,30,ESFJ,33,"<Yes>  can easily empathize. I value human relationships, so I tend to easily empathize with and fall for people from completely different backgrounds. I recently had a conversation with a new person who had a family history that was completely opposite to mine, and I quickly became immersed and understood what he was doing."
13594,227,1,30,ESFJ,34,"<no>  When making a decision about something, in the end, the first thought is reflected in the decision, so I tend to make a decision right away rather than delaying it until the end."
13595,227,1,30,ESFJ,35,"<no>  I tend to reconsider the decisions I have already made. If a decision I've already made is wrong, I think I'll think again to avoid making the same decision."
13596,227,1,30,ESFJ,36,"<Yes>  Rather than spending time alone, I tend to relieve my fatigue from the week with fun parties and events. These days, I go camping with my neighbors and have a party at home to relieve the fatigue of the week."
13597,227,1,30,ESFJ,37,<no>  I don't like going to museums or looking at works of art. I think I prefer dynamic rather than static.
13598,227,1,30,ESFJ,38,"<no> Sometimes it's hard to understand other people's feelings, but most of the time it's not difficult to understand other people's feelings. Just like when an acquaintance told me of his feelings of betrayal and anger from someone else, I sympathized and empathized with him, and my anger healed as if I had become that person."
13599,227,1,30,ESFJ,39,<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos. There is a sense of accomplishment when you execute each planned task one by one.
13600,227,1,30,ESFJ,40,"<neutrality> There are times when I feel insecure, but I don't think it lasts long. When I focus on other things, I tend to get rid of my anxiety quickly, but I think this is more of an inherent control rather than an innate tendency."
13601,227,1,30,ESFJ,41,"<no>  I don't avoid making phone calls. I prefer to avoid making phone calls because voice communication rather than message conveying can be a clear communication, including each other's feelings."
13602,227,1,30,ESFJ,42,"<no> It doesn't take much time to understand opinions that differ from mine. The important thing is to listen to the other person's opinion. It's easier to understand what the other person's thoughts are when you listen to them. Recently, I had a conversation with my husband that I want to move because I want to create a better educational environment for my child, and my husband's opinion that no matter how good the environment is if the child does not have the heart to study, it is useless."
13603,227,1,30,ESFJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends first to ask them to meet up. We can't keep in touch often, but if we need to meet, he seems to take the lead in contacting us and making an appointment."
13604,227,1,30,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  If my plans go wrong, I tend to try to get back to them as soon as possible. Recently, I was planning a trip to go on a family trip, but since my husband was on a business trip, I had to cancel all the schedules and reschedule another date."
13605,227,1,30,ESFJ,45,"<Yes>  There are many times when I regret the mistakes of a long time ago. What I'm regretting lately is that I said something hurtful to an acquaintance, so I'm regretting it."
13606,227,1,30,ESFJ,46,"<Yes>  I tend not to think deeply about human existence and the reason for living. Since the essence of human beings is fixed and each individual has its own unique characteristics, the reason for existence and life will vary from individual to individual. Therefore, I don't think I have to think about the reason for human existence and life."
13607,227,1,30,ESFJ,47,"<Yes>  tend to be swayed by emotions. When I see my attitude toward my child while having a bad feeling about a couple fighting, I feel like I'm being swayed by my emotions. When my husband sees me, he tells me that I am honest with my feelings."
13608,227,1,30,ESFJ,48,"<neutrality>  There are times when I try to save the other person's face, and there are times when I don't. If the other person admits that it's their fault, they try to save the other person's face, but if they don't admit it to the end, I don't think there's any need to try to save face."
13621,228,0,30,ISTJ,1,"<no>  Usually, if the environment is new, they make new friends, but if the environment is not different, they do not make new friends and hang out with existing friends. If you have friends, you are comfortable talking to them, so you don't risk it."
13622,228,0,30,ISTJ,2,"<no>  usually do not make an effort to explore various interests because I only do it when I am stuck on one interest. Recently, my body gets tired frequently, so I am focusing on running as a hobby according to the need for exercise."
13623,228,0,30,ISTJ,3,"<no>  Most of the time this is not the case. If someone else's environment is different, I can't relate to it, so there comes a moment when I'm not sure how to respond. Whenever that happens, I try to force myself to react, conscious of my lack of empathy."
13624,228,0,30,ISTJ,4,"<Yes>  There are a lot of unexpected things in the world, and it's very stressful when things don't go as expected, so I try to prepare for as many scenarios as possible."
13625,228,0,30,ISTJ,5,"<no>  When I was working for a company, especially when deadlines were within a few hours, I had the experience of not being able to do my job well because I was impatient."
13626,228,0,30,ISTJ,6,"<no>  I don't want to stress about getting to know someone new, so I tend to talk to people I already know."
13627,228,0,30,ISTJ,7,"<no>  I tend to do things like this. If I run into difficulties while working on a project, I stop and work on another project. It's because I feel comfortable when I have to finish something."
13628,228,0,30,ISTJ,8,"<no>  When you talk with friends who are deeply emotional, there are many moments when it is difficult to empathize with them. I think it's because I tend to think rationally rather than empathize."
13629,228,0,30,ISTJ,9,"<Yes>  At the start of each day, make a to-do list. I often create planners on my computer, and carry around my cell phone to add, change, and delete to-dos from time to time."
13630,228,0,30,ISTJ,10,"<Yes>  Because I am very sensitive to small mistakes, I often criticize myself more than others scold me. In my work, there was a time when I misunderstood a number and sent the wrong result to a customer, and I suffered all day that day."
13631,228,0,30,ISTJ,11,"<no> Even if you are interested, it is very difficult to reach. I have experienced a lot of worries and fears that I might make a mistake while talking while being nervous and that my image would only get worse."
13632,228,0,30,ISTJ,12,"<neutrality>  I have to be interested to be willing to talk about a work of art. If not, I tend to show little interest."
13633,228,0,30,ISTJ,13,"<Yes> When embarking on something, I especially tend to follow reason. You want to do something logically, not emotionally. However, people around me say that I am a bit emotional."
13634,228,0,30,ISTJ,14,"<no>  I don't fully plan my day, but I don't do things spontaneously. I prefer to plan because planning unscheduled things always goes differently than I thought."
13635,228,0,30,ISTJ,15,"<Yes>  You seem to be paying a lot more attention than others. In particular, when I was giving a presentation, there were times when it didn't go well because I was overly conscious of what others thought of what I was saying."
13636,228,0,30,ISTJ,16,"<no>  don't like activities with others to the extent that I want to avoid them as much as possible. I don't particularly like to do events that bring a lot of unity, such as year-end parties and sports competitions, but these days, when I do, I get along surprisingly well."
13637,228,0,30,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I prefer cases with a clear ending. I can't write it down because I don't watch movies or books lately, but I usually prefer works that don't stress me out about thinking."
13638,228,0,30,ISTJ,18,"<no> Above all, I feel great satisfaction in the success of my own work. It's because what you face at any moment is yourself, not others."
13639,228,0,30,ISTJ,19,"<no>  I have very little interest. Among many games, I tend to focus only on the soccer game that I have been interested in since high school."
13640,228,0,30,ISTJ,20,"<Yes>  You seem to be worrying often. I think that if something goes wrong, I will be less stressed if I act quickly, so I worry about it every minute."
13641,228,0,30,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  I want to avoid the role of leader. It's because I think I'm lacking myself, so I'm not the type to tell others what to do."
13642,228,0,30,ISTJ,22,"<Yes>  My thoughts seem to be stuck. I tend to think one-dimensionally so as not to deviate from the knowledge I know, so when I see a work of art, I often interpret it as it is."
13643,228,0,30,ISTJ,23,<Yes>  I think everything is not good if you put your emotions first. This is because we believe that we need to think rationally to know the root cause of work and ultimately solve it.
13644,228,0,30,ISTJ,24,"<no>  The reason I'm taking a break is because I'm having a hard time right now. If you don't take a break right away, I think the effect will be almost gone."
13645,228,0,30,ISTJ,25,<no>  It's uncomfortable to see other people arguing. It's because you feel like you're wasting your time or emotions by talking unnecessarily.
13646,228,0,30,ISTJ,26,"<neutrality>  I want to live a quiet life, but I tend to get upset if you don't pay too much attention to it. Thank you for silently recognizing my efforts and silently recognizing my worth."
13647,228,0,30,ISTJ,27,"<no> Emotions rarely change. The more you try to startle someone, the more calm you tend to be."
13648,228,0,30,ISTJ,28,"<Yes>  I'm feeling a bit stuffy. So, using the knowledge I know, I will step forward and tell you how to do it more efficiently."
13649,228,0,30,ISTJ,29,<Yes>  I hate to do things I don't want to do. Not much different lately.
13650,228,0,30,ISTJ,30,<no> Not very interested. It's because I think there is not enough time to be faithful to the current reality.
13651,228,0,30,ISTJ,31,"<neutrality>  It's good to be alone, but sometimes it's good to be with others. It's the same these days, but when I'm with other people, I think it's difficult because I have to use a lot of energy."
13652,228,0,30,ISTJ,32,<no>  think the theory-based discussion is well worthwhile. It is because I think that you can get an idea to solve a problem through a principled story.
13653,228,0,30,ISTJ,33,<no>  It's hard for me to empathize with someone from a different background than mine. I had no choice but to sympathize with the work of a friend who had a different background from mine because I couldn't relate to anything I hadn't experienced.
13654,228,0,30,ISTJ,34,<Yes>  tend to go through a lot of hard work before making a decision. It's because I'm thinking about the value of what I'll lose if I choose either one.
13655,228,0,30,ISTJ,35,"<no>  Even if I have already made a decision, I tend to keep thinking about it. It seems that I am controlling myself thinking that it would be okay if I did this."
13656,228,0,30,ISTJ,36,"<no>  Alone time is comfortable. Because when you're tired, especially when you're with other people, it drains your energy. It still maintains the same attitude these days."
13657,228,0,30,ISTJ,37,<no>  I don't really like going to art galleries. The fact that the results can be interpreted differently is not very attractive to me.
13658,228,0,30,ISTJ,38,"<Yes>  It's very hard to empathize with your feelings. I usually think based on logical thinking, but from my point of view, it's frustrating when I don't understand other people's actions at all."
13659,228,0,30,ISTJ,39,"<Yes>  Whether it's work or personal, I always plan. When I complete the planned tasks one by one, the efficiency of work increases, and it seems to be helpful because I am aware of the tasks I have to do."
13660,228,0,30,ISTJ,40,"<Yes>  I'm on the sensitive side, so I often get anxious over trivial things. It seems that my parents, who nag me every time I make a mistake, have a big influence on this."
13661,228,0,30,ISTJ,41,<Yes>  This is because it is difficult for me to communicate my thoughts clearly while communicating with others. I tend to avoid uncomfortable situations.
13662,228,0,30,ISTJ,42,"<Yes>  Since the scope of my understanding is very narrow, I tend to spend more time than others to understand other opinions."
13663,228,0,30,ISTJ,43,<no>  I usually do not contact them. It's because I don't think there's any need to do it if there's nothing to contact.
13664,228,0,30,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  If your plan is disrupted, you are not in the mood to make another plan. Even in my work, I tend to make an effort to go back to the starting point and think."
13665,228,0,30,ISTJ,45,"<no>  Old mistakes are rarely remembered. It's not that I don't want to think about it, and most of it is that I don't remember it over time."
13666,228,0,30,ISTJ,46,"<Yes> We rarely think about human existence, about why we live. It's because thinking deeply philosophically is itself a headache."
13667,228,0,30,ISTJ,47,"<Yes>  It seems that you tend to think somewhat emotionally. When someone orders me to do something I don't understand, it's common for me to get stressed out by only emotionally approaching it."
13668,228,0,30,ISTJ,48,<no>  don't try to save face because I think it will be more helpful to the other person if I point out their mistakes.
13681,229,1,20,ISTP,1,<no>  You don't make new friends on a regular basis. I tend to interact with friends I have known before. I'm not the type who likes to meet new people.
13682,229,1,20,ISTP,2,"<Yes>  Whether it's viewing art, listening to music, or exercising, my free time is spent exploring a variety of interests. These days, I'm interested in visiting exhibitions."
13683,229,1,20,ISTP,3,"<no>  Seeing other people cry is understandable, but it doesn't make you want to cry yourself. In those situations, when you get the context of someone else crying and find out why they're crying, you just do it."
13684,229,1,20,ISTP,4,<no>  They don't have multiple contingency plans in case things go wrong. I don't often expect things to go wrong.
13685,229,1,20,ISTP,5,<Yes>  I tend to maintain my composure even in high-pressure environments. I don't feel the pressure very well. I have never been in a high-pressure environment.
13686,229,1,20,ISTP,6,<Yes>  I find it difficult to introduce myself to new people. I feel more comfortable hanging out with people I already know than new people.
13687,229,1,20,ISTP,7,"<no>  If there is a blockage while working on one project, I tend not to hold on to it for long and move on to another project. Depending on your concentration, you move through the project. When doing school assignments, if one gets stuck, start another."
13688,229,1,20,ISTP,8,<no> I'm not sentimental. There are very few things that get wet with emotions while going through everyday life. People around me say that I am far from being an emotional person.
13689,229,1,20,ISTP,9,"<no>  Rather than making a plan, I tend to take care of the things that come to mind right away. I've never bought a diary."
13690,229,1,20,ISTP,10,"<no> Most of the time, I'm not the type to doubt my abilities and knowledge. I have no doubts because I have faith in my memory. Even when I have small arguments with other people in my daily life about whether I am right or wrong about a certain topic, I tend to believe in myself and express my opinion."
13691,229,1,20,ISTP,11,"<no>  Even if you are interested, you may not be able to approach and talk to them first. Most of them look from afar."
13692,229,1,20,ISTP,12,"<no>  like to explore different interpretations of works of art, and I love hearing other people's opinions on interpretations. It is interesting to see various interpretations coming out of a single work."
13693,229,1,20,ISTP,13,"<Yes>  I feel that I tend to follow reason rather than emotion. Even around me, I am seen as a rational person."
13694,229,1,20,ISTP,14,"<Yes>  don't plan a schedule for the day, and I tend to do what comes to mind at that time. Even in the past, the frequency of doing something when I suddenly wanted to do something rather than making a plan for the day was high."
13695,229,1,20,ISTP,15,<Yes>  I don't really care what other people think of me. I don't think I was conscious of the other person's gaze from a young age.
13696,229,1,20,ISTP,16,"<neutrality>  participate in group activities with close people, but I don't tend to participate in group activities with new people. These days, I enjoy meeting with my friends, but I avoid places like school club gatherings."
13697,229,1,20,ISTP,17,"<Yes>  I like works where people can give different interpretations after seeing the ending. We enjoy sharing different opinions about each other's work. Recently directed by Jordan Peele, Nob."
13698,229,1,20,ISTP,18,"<no>  don't think it's bad to help others succeed, but it feels fleeting compared to your own success. Prioritize yourself over others."
13699,229,1,20,ISTP,19,"<no>  You have many interests, but you don't know what to do next. Even if you have many interests, there are often only one thing you want to do at the time."
13700,229,1,20,ISTP,20,"<no>  I'm not the type to worry about what I'm doing wrong. I have a lot of thoughts about what will happen if something goes wrong. There is no motive or reason, it seems to be like this originally."
13701,229,1,20,ISTP,21,"<Yes>  Leaders have to lead the group in a good direction by communicating and coordinating opinions with many people, but I find it annoying to communicate with many people and coordinate opinions."
13702,229,1,20,ISTP,22,<no>  I think I have pretty artistic inclinations. I have often been told that I have an aesthetic sense from the appreciation of the paintings I draw as a hobby.
13703,229,1,20,ISTP,23,"<no>  I tend to follow reason more than emotion, but I believe that the world should maintain a balance between emotion and reason."
13704,229,1,20,ISTP,24,"<no>  If I want to take a break right now, I tend to take a break. I think it doesn't matter if I take a break first because I'm going to finish my chores anyway."
13705,229,1,20,ISTP,25,<Yes> It's fun to see other people's arguments. It's fun to listen to each other's arguments and argue.
13706,229,1,20,ISTP,26,"<Yes>  You don't want to attract other people's attention. Because I am not interested in other people, it seems that I do not pay attention and I do not want to attract the other person's attention."
13707,229,1,20,ISTP,27,"<no>  I am very blunt on emotions. No matter what environment I was in, my emotions never fluctuated too much."
13708,229,1,20,ISTP,28,"<Yes>  I'm not a perfectly efficient person, but it's very annoying to see people who aren't even as efficient as they are. There have been many times when I have been angry at a team member for not being efficient with their time on team assignments."
13709,229,1,20,ISTP,29,"<neutrality>  I tend to procrastinate things like housework, but I tend to finish the public tasks first. It's the same lately."
13710,229,1,20,ISTP,30,<no>  I don't think there is an afterlife. I am not interested in the afterlife or religion.
13711,229,1,20,ISTP,31,<no>  I feel more comfortable spending time alone than with other people. Alone is the most comfortable. It's the same these days.
13712,229,1,20,ISTP,32,"<Yes> I'm not very interested in the obvious opinions that anyone can have. I don't think there's any reason to refute such an obvious statement. Parents' nagging is a very principled story, so it's not without difficulty when you hear it."
13713,229,1,20,ISTP,33,"<no>  If you can understand the situation, you will understand it in your head, but I don't think you will sympathize. I think I'll focus on 'this was the situation' rather than 'that's how it must have been'."
13714,229,1,20,ISTP,34,<Yes>  often hear people say that I have indecisiveness because I am not good at making decisions. I'm having a hard time choosing between the two.
13715,229,1,20,ISTP,35,"<neutrality>  You see the consequences of your decision and think about what it would have been like if you had made a different decision, but you immediately find it meaningless and don't want to think about it any more."
13716,229,1,20,ISTP,36,"<no>  Of course, fun parties and events are good, but I think you should be alone to relieve the 'fatigue' of the week. During breaks, I am mostly alone."
13717,229,1,20,ISTP,37,<Yes>  I love going to art galleries and exhibitions. I enjoy appreciating art and finding out the intentions and interpretations of the artist.
13718,229,1,20,ISTP,38,"<no>  You can understand other people's feelings. But empathy is difficult. In some situations, the understanding of 'why do I do this?' is passed off as 'it could be just that', but it doesn't look good."
13719,229,1,20,ISTP,39,"<no> Plan is a word far from me. Even if you make a plan, you don't stick to it."
13720,229,1,20,ISTP,40,<Yes>  I hardly feel any anxiety. I have very few mood swings. It seems to be an innate tendency.
13721,229,1,20,ISTP,41,<neutrality>  Making phone calls is not difficult. But I am very reluctant to call people who I find difficult. It seems that this is the case for other people as well.
13722,229,1,20,ISTP,42,"<no>  I tend to spend a lot of time discussing opinions that are very different from my own, but not to understand, but to convince the other person that my opinion is correct. I usually do that when I have a conflicting opinion with the other person."
13723,229,1,20,ISTP,43,"<no>  I keep in touch with my friends, but I usually don't contact them to meet them first."
13724,229,1,20,ISTP,44,"<no>  If plans go awry, they don't try to go back to their original plans, they make other plans. Recently, on a trip with a friend, the exhibition schedule was disrupted, so I went to a popular cafe nearby without looking for another exhibition."
13725,229,1,20,ISTP,45,"<neutrality>  I don't often regret my mistakes long ago, but sometimes I do. These days, I feel like my career path is unclear, and I want to go back to when I was deciding my career path in high school."
13726,229,1,20,ISTP,46,"<Yes>  Topics such as human existence and the reason for living feel too philosophical. Sometimes I think about it, but I don't think deeply."
13727,229,1,20,ISTP,47,<no>  I think I am very good at controlling my emotions. People around me also evaluate me that way.
13728,229,1,20,ISTP,48,"<no> When the other person's fault is obvious, I tend to point out the fault properly and then help him not to do it next time. I think it will be more helpful if you know what is not and fix it."
13741,230,1,40,ESFJ,1,"<no>  I don't make new friends regularly. The reason is that I try to be friendly with people I meet for some reason, but I don't make friends by approaching people I don't know first."
13742,230,1,40,ESFJ,2,<neutrality>  don't explore my diverse interests every time. I would look for books only when I have a field of interest and when I have time left.
13743,230,1,40,ESFJ,3,"<neutrality>  I don't want to cry every time. Sometimes I think that if the reason the person is crying is in a situation similar to mine, I want to cry too, but not every time."
13744,230,1,40,ESFJ,4,"<neutrality>  don't make countermeasures every time. The reason is that I will make other preparations for things that must be done, but I tend to just pass by if things go wrong and it doesn't matter too much."
13745,230,1,40,ESFJ,5,"<no>  I might be a little scared in a high pressure environment. The reason is that I do not work while blaming the environment, but if the pressure is too severe, I think there are times when I lose my composure."
13746,230,1,40,ESFJ,6,"<neutrality>  am neutral The reason is that I can introduce myself first with new people, and I think I will have a conversation with someone I already know."
13747,230,1,40,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  I finish one project and do another. The reason is that it's easier to make a plan first, then solve the problem, and then make another plan, and things don't get confused."
13748,230,1,40,ESFJ,8,"<Yes>  am emotional. Whether watching dramas or listening to other people's words, I often shed tears when I feel sorry for a sad scene or situation."
13749,230,1,40,ESFJ,9,"<Yes>  I plan and work. The reason is that I plan my daily to-dos in my cell phone diary, write down the schedule for a month in detail, and try to finish the planned task without missing it."
13750,230,1,40,ESFJ,10,"<neutrality>  I don't make many mistakes, but there are times when I doubt my ability for small mistakes, and there are times when I don't. The reason is that I don't doubt when I make too many mistakes, but when things don't work because I'm not good at judging my thoughts, I sometimes doubt that my knowledge and skills are still lacking."
13751,230,1,40,ESFJ,11,"<neutrality>  I guess it depends on the situation. The reason is that it is not difficult to meet and talk with new people, but I would be a bit cautious about approaching them because I am interested in them, so I am cautious about approaching them because I like them. It seems that it is not difficult to get there."
13752,230,1,40,ESFJ,12,"<neutrality>  I think it will change depending on the situation from time to time. The reason is that the range of art works is so wide and there are not many works of art that I know about, so I am interested in discussing works of art that I know, and I do not think I am interested in discussing works I do not know."
13753,230,1,40,ESFJ,13,"<Yes>  I value reason more than emotion. The reason is that I only show my emotions well when I am sad, and I don't tend to reveal other parts too much. Even when I draw conclusions in a situation, I hear that I have no humanity because I judge the situation too rationally."
13754,230,1,40,ESFJ,14,"<no>  like to plan my day and move around. The reason is that there are things to do that day, but if you start with the things you want to do spontaneously, you may not be able to finish all the things you have to do for the day."
13755,230,1,40,ESFJ,15,"<Yes>  I don't worry about the eyes of the people around me. The reason is that while living in the world, I put more importance on whether I am a person who is proud of myself, and I do not care much about the evaluation of others."
13756,230,1,40,ESFJ,16,"<Yes>  I like group activities. The reason is that I can do things that I cannot do alone through group activities, and I can get to know people I didn't know, so I do volunteer work while doing group activities. Even now, while working as a youth parent association volunteer group, we are meeting various parents and students and helping youth activities."
13757,230,1,40,ESFJ,17,"<no>  I like the part where the ending matches with someone else's point of view rather than my own way. The reason is, first of all, I want to know what the creator's interpretation of the work is, and then I prefer to feel it while reading the book or looking at the work. I also want to gain enlightenment."
13758,230,1,40,ESFJ,18,"<neutrality>  I am neutral. The reason seems to vary from case to case. I think I want my success first, and if I am doing something that I want to see someone happy through group activities, I think I will be satisfied with helping that person succeed."
13759,230,1,40,ESFJ,19,<no>  I don't have too many interests. The reason is that there is nothing that I do not know what to do because I set a few things to do or a few things to do at the time and proceed with the work. It's a style that proceeds with the next plan step by step.
13760,230,1,40,ESFJ,20,"<no> I'm not the type to worry too much. The reason is that the thinking is a bit positive. Even if it doesn't work, I'll do it again and I'm the type to keep challenging myself. I have the will to think positively and proceed to do something well."
13761,230,1,40,ESFJ,21,"<Yes>  I consider myself better able to act as a staff member helping a leader than as a leader. The reason is that the leadership position is burdensome, and I worry about whether I can do well in that position, and I feel pressure because it is a position that requires responsibility."
13762,230,1,40,ESFJ,22,"<no>  I think I have a bit of an artistic inclination. The reason is that I was involved in art activities when I was young, and I also liked visiting art galleries, so I often visited them."
13763,230,1,40,ESFJ,23,<Yes>  think the world would be a better place if reason was more important than emotion. The reason is that it seems more likely that you can't control your emotions and let things go the wrong way. It's because there are more cases where things go wrong because you can't accept people's emotions well and can't control your own emotions.
13764,230,1,40,ESFJ,24,"<neutrality> For me it depends. The reason is that if no one is at home, I take a break and then do housework, and if there are many family members at home, I tend to finish the housework before taking a break and then take a break. When I am alone at home, I feel better if I take a break first."
13765,230,1,40,ESFJ,25,"<no>  I don't like looking at other people's arguments. The reason is that I prefer quiet to loud, so I don't enjoy wasting time watching other people's arguments."
13766,230,1,40,ESFJ,26,"<Yes>  I try not to attract other people's attention. The reason is that I like to talk while hanging out with others, but I also like to be alone, so I don't really like the part where others focus on me. So I tend to be quiet and not attract attention."
13767,230,1,40,ESFJ,27,"<no>  don't have rapid emotional changes. The reason is that when I think about my emotions, I tend to control my emotions well because I have a cold side."
13768,230,1,40,ESFJ,28,"<Yes>  I get annoyed when I see people who don't move efficiently. The reason is that if you think and act a little, you can have a better effect, but if you just move without thinking and make things more difficult, it creates a situation that makes it difficult for others, so I don't like people who are not efficient."
13769,230,1,40,ESFJ,29,"<no>  I am a person who thinks that I must do the work given to me. The reason is that I tend to take responsibility for the tasks given to me. Even now, while raising my four siblings, I try to do my best in the work given to me, so I make sure to finish it within that period."
13770,230,1,40,ESFJ,30,"<no>  don't think there is an afterlife. The reason is that I don't even believe in religion, but I'm living in reality with the thought of enjoying this time given to me to the fullest. I live thinking that there is no afterlife."
13771,230,1,40,ESFJ,31,"<neutrality>  like spending time alone and spending time with other people. The reason is that I need time alone and time to hang out with others. So I make plans to meet people a week, and the rest of the time I live by adjusting my own time."
13772,230,1,40,ESFJ,32,"<neutrality>  I don't really like discussions either, so depending on the situation, I might not be interested or I might like them. The reason is that a theory-based story has much more to say than something too abstract."
13773,230,1,40,ESFJ,33,"<no>  I don't think I can easily empathize with someone from a completely different background. The reason is that people live by making judgments based on their own experiences, but I don't think it's easy to sympathize with people who are completely different from me. Can a beggar understand a rich man? Can a woman fully empathize with a man? I think it's hard to relate to someone completely different."
13774,230,1,40,ESFJ,34,"<neutrality>  I make some decisions quickly and others easily. The reason is that when it comes to things that require careful thinking and looking at the front and back, think about it until the end, and then get off and get off easily."
13775,230,1,40,ESFJ,35,"<Yes> When I make a decision, I don't think about it again. The reason is that if you acted on that decision and did your best, you don't give it a second thought. That's why I think more and think about the results before I draw conclusions."
13776,230,1,40,ESFJ,36,"<neutrality>  think alone time and fun party time should be evenly matched. The reason is that people can't be alone every time and it's hard to have a party every time, so I tend to spend time alone once a week and have a fun party to relieve stress with my family and friends."
13777,230,1,40,ESFJ,37,<Yes>  I like to go to art galleries. The reason is that I like art works while learning landscape painting as a child.
13778,230,1,40,ESFJ,38,"<no>  I'm more into understanding other people's feelings. The reason is that I like to observe others when I look at them, so I tend to look at them well and listen to their stories. So the part about understanding other people's feelings is not difficult."
13779,230,1,40,ESFJ,39,"<Yes>  like to plan my daily to-dos. The reason is that I plan what to do that day every day, and if I have nothing to do, I try to plan and do other things to do today."
13780,230,1,40,ESFJ,40,"<neutrality>  I don't feel anxious a lot of the time, but I don't feel it either. The reason is that not everyone can live without feeling insecure. I think it works well with a little anxiety. There are parts where I work harder because of anxiety."
13781,230,1,40,ESFJ,41,"<no>  I don't like to avoid making phone calls. The reason is that there are times when I need to hear the person's point of view right away when something happens, but I don't know if I don't talk on the phone, so I tend to call right away when I have to make a phone call."
13782,230,1,40,ESFJ,42,"<neutrality>  try to understand my opinions and others. The reason is that having a different opinion from mine is a situation that arises because the environment and experiences in which you have lived are different, so I try to hear why the other person's thoughts are the same. And when I do group activities, there are many people who are different from me, so there are many times when I have to follow other people's opinions rather than my own, so I think I'm trying to understand through those experiences."
13783,230,1,40,ESFJ,43,"<Yes>  tend to contact my friends first. The reason is because I have a tendency to like people, so if I want to hear the voices of my friends and ask about their safety, I tend to call them right away. I also make sure to say hello on a regular basis a few times a year."
13784,230,1,40,ESFJ,44,"<Yes>  have a tendency to finish what I have planned. The reason is that I get upset when something I planned doesn't go well and I tend to think about how to solve it, so I always try to solve the problem quickly and even solve the planned thing even if I can't do it right away because my plan went wrong. While working on a schedule for 4 children, schedules are sometimes delayed due to other children, but I try to do what I planned ahead of time with my children."
13785,230,1,40,ESFJ,45,"<neutrality> There are times when I regret it, and there are times when I don't regret it and think it was a good opportunity. The reason is that sometimes things work out better because of that mistake. You may feel that the world is so easy when all the things you have planned come true, but life is not easy, so rather, because of that mistake, I think that I have time to reflect and an opportunity to develop myself further, so I regret it and laugh and remember that time more. It seems to think good."
13786,230,1,40,ESFJ,46,"<Yes>  I work harder to be happy today rather than the meaning of life. The reason is that human beings were born to enjoy this life, and since they were born, they think that it is enough to live without a wish and die without regret. I think it's more difficult if you think too deeply about the meaning of life. I believe that living happily today and planning for the future is more valuable in terms of life."
13787,230,1,40,ESFJ,47,"<no>  I control my emotions. The reason is that even if I look at myself, I think I am good at controlling my emotions. I try to think rationally without being swayed by others. I hear a lot of people say that reason seems to be more faithful than emotions. I seem to be good at controlling anger and anger."
13788,230,1,40,ESFJ,48,"<neutrality>  I try to save face rather than clearly pinpointing the other person's fault. The reason is because humans are animals that make mistakes. However, mistakes that cause harm to others tell us in detail about the person's mistakes rather than saving face, so that we can apologize."
13801,231,0,40,INTP,1,<no>  I tend to enjoy spending time with people I know or have known rather than meeting new people.
13802,231,0,40,INTP,2,"<Yes>  I have a lot of curiosity and I tend to be interested in various things. Also, when I don't have much time, I tend to learn about my interests through books."
13803,231,0,40,INTP,3,"<Yes>  In the past, I didn't have much empathy for the people around me. But these days, even if you hear or watch a story on TV or other media, you can easily relate to it."
13804,231,0,40,INTP,4,"<Yes>  I don't know if it's my personality or my life, but since I've been in contact with PCs for a long time, I think of various variables and simulate them with my head."
13805,231,0,40,INTP,5,"<no>  In my case, I recently had a week-long argument about who should take the jackpot with a story about responsibility for receiving and paying for materials at the company. I remember losing my composure and fighting often during the story."
13806,231,0,40,INTP,6,"<Yes>  Maybe my personality is timid, but I had a party last winter, and it was embarrassing. He seems like a character that is hard to get along with."
13807,231,0,40,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  In my case, what I am interested in and what I do with my work tend to be different. The reason is that the second job is done step by step, but the second job is delayed for some reason, so it seems that one work continues to be jumbled."
13808,231,0,40,INTP,8,"<Yes>  I like looking at artistic pictures or pictures that interest me. For the second job, I tend to be interested in it because it is a design type."
13809,231,0,40,INTP,9,"<Yes>  For me, I like to organize my schedule with my PC. I am always worried about how to organize the folders and files on my PC."
13810,231,0,40,INTP,10,"<neutrality> In my opinion, it depends on the difference in mistakes. It is because the ability and knowledge can be different between mistakes that can be overlooked and mistakes that must be taken responsibility for."
13811,231,0,40,INTP,11,"<no>  My personality is not easily approachable. The reason, I think, is that he is introverted and timid because it takes a lot of time to become friends with people he meets for the first time."
13812,231,0,40,INTP,12,"<Yes> In my case, various interpretations of art depend on the viewer, so I think that is art. In my case, I don't think this feeling of art is enough to discuss with others."
13813,231,0,40,INTP,13,"<neutrality>  In my case, sometimes reason takes precedence, and sometimes emotion takes precedence. The reason is not a robot, but a person, so I think it's different depending on who and the situation around you."
13814,231,0,40,INTP,14,"<Yes>  In my case, I am an improvisational person. I think about planning and moving, but in the end I improvise."
13815,231,0,40,INTP,15,"<no>  In my case, I tend to be conscious of how the people around me see me. The reason is that, in my opinion, humans are social animals that cannot help but be aware of their surroundings."
13816,231,0,40,INTP,16,"<no>  I've done club activities and group meetings before, but it didn't seem right for me. The reason is that I don't enjoy meeting and talking to new people."
13817,231,0,40,INTP,17,"<neutrality>  In my case, it depends on the ending. It depends on whether it is tragic or happy, thriller or romance."
13818,231,0,40,INTP,18,"<no>  I am a greedy person. In my case, I am more interested in my own development than in helping others."
13819,231,0,40,INTP,19,"<Yes>  As for me, I am curious. I am very curious, so when I see something new, I want to try it."
13820,231,0,40,INTP,20,"<Yes>  In my case, I often worry when I am in charge of a task. My head tells me not to do this, but my body doesn't."
13821,231,0,40,INTP,21,"<Yes>  I am a follower, not a leader. Maybe it's because of my personality, I don't like to take responsibility or step forward."
13822,231,0,40,INTP,22,"<neutrality>  I felt a lot of things while doing the second job these days. The reason is that I got a job knowing how to do well while working on design, but I feel a lot of lack of ability if I don't have half a job. Neutral is that the hiring manager seems to have felt my artistic sense and got a job, but I think it is lacking."
13823,231,0,40,INTP,23,"<no> In my case, reason and emotion are jumbled together, but I don't think it's the case when only one exists. I don't think any of them should be lacking."
13824,231,0,40,INTP,24,<no>  I am always told to clean up the house and live. I think you should really rest when you rest. Housework is also considered work.
13825,231,0,40,INTP,25,"<no>  In my case, I don't like the controversy itself very much. I hear a lot about people like water."
13826,231,0,40,INTP,26,"<Yes>  I like to be around like air. But that doesn't mean he doesn't have a presence, but he doesn't have a personality that stands out openly."
13827,231,0,40,INTP,27,"<neutrality>  I am cautious. Sometimes he changes, but usually he is a person who tries to be discreet."
13828,231,0,40,INTP,28,"<neutrality>  I like to be a bit efficient, but I don't like to force it on others. speak. However, it is not an overt comment."
13829,231,0,40,INTP,29,"<neutrality>  In my case, I usually don't get things done quickly. Of course, I think about the strength of the work and move, but I don't think it's unconditionally postponed."
13830,231,0,40,INTP,30,"<Yes>  In my case, I have a curiosity about the afterlife. It seems that you can't conclude that there is no reason because you can't see it."
13831,231,0,40,INTP,31,"<no> In my case, I always thought it would be nice to have a PC or something to eat on a deserted island in the past. Everyone sees me and says that I am an island person. I like to enjoy being alone and think to myself."
13832,231,0,40,INTP,32,"<Yes>  Strangely, I study in a different or my own way. I look at the book, but I only see the summary, and only the core or the part I need."
13833,231,0,40,INTP,33,"<no> For me, it is not easy to empathize. The reason is that each person has a different perspective. Their experiences are different and their lives are different, so I wonder if I can understand and sympathize with them all."
13834,231,0,40,INTP,34,<Yes>  I seem indecisive. It's called decision paralysis. It seems to have this tendency.
13835,231,0,40,INTP,35,"<Yes>  I wrote that it was, but I think it's mostly like that. It's hard to decide, so I'm trying not to decide again."
13836,231,0,40,INTP,36,<no>  I prefer to have alone time or thoughts. Maybe that's why I don't like to talk to people I don't know.
13837,231,0,40,INTP,37,"<Yes>  I like to look at the designs sometimes or before bed. It's my second job design, so I'm interested in that."
13838,231,0,40,INTP,38,"<Yes>  Sometimes there are arguments. Sometimes I wonder why I am so angry. I don't think it's a big deal from my point of view, but if I were in that person's position, I'd go over like this. The reason is because I try to listen to the other person's story and empathize. But still, it's not easy."
13839,231,0,40,INTP,39,"<no>  tend to improvise. It's not like my main job is to plan and do, and I think I'm like this because I live like this."
13840,231,0,40,INTP,40,"<no>  I don't know how long ago, but I feel a little uncomfortable when I'm with other people. For some reason, I don't like awkwardness when the story ends. He hated talking about me."
13841,231,0,40,INTP,41,"<Yes>  seldom make the first call in the past. Almost every time a friend calls me, I answer and talk. It doesn't seem to be social, but it doesn't seem like bullying."
13842,231,0,40,INTP,42,"<neutrality>  Occasionally, I listen to different agendas or become topics that differ from mine. At times like this, I tend to think about the importance of this topic or story first, and think about how much time I can devote to it."
13843,231,0,40,INTP,43,"<no>  don't call and ask to meet up first. Of course not every time, never. However, it is not as calculated as it is."
13844,231,0,40,INTP,44,"<no>  I guess I'm a spontaneous person. Even if you have a plan, I think it can change depending on the situation or the people around you."
13845,231,0,40,INTP,45,"<Yes>  Sometimes I even kick when I'm sleeping. It's usually when I'm stupid, but I tend to regret it later."
13846,231,0,40,INTP,46,"<Yes>  I actually don't think about existence that much. I don't have too many thoughts. Life is busy, but even if I think deeply, I think of what happened at that time, but I do not go deeper."
13847,231,0,40,INTP,47,"<neutrality>  I have more emotions than reason, but I don't live by cutting and controlling them. I think I am neutral rather than too rational or emotional."
13848,231,0,40,INTP,48,"<neutrality>  I depend on who that person is to me. If it's the fault of the person you don't like, you really ignore it without remorse. But if it's different, think a little. Don't just look at this time, look ahead."
13861,232,1,30,ESTJ,1,"<neutrality>  I was like that in my 20s, but not until my mid-30s. The reason is that although meeting new people is fun now, it feels a bit tired."
13862,232,1,30,ESTJ,2,"<Yes>  I can't just relax in my free time. The reason is inclination. These days, I'm focusing on various ways to increase investment, salt tech, and income."
13863,232,1,30,ESTJ,3,"<no>  I wasn't like that before, but as I started my social life, I lost much interest in other people's tears. The reason is that I don't want to care whether it's my business or good or bad."
13864,232,1,30,ESTJ,4,"<Yes>  Most of the time, I tend to prepare preparations like a and a-1. In the case of travel, you need to be prepared for unexpected events so that you can continue to enjoy your trip until the end even if an unexpected situation occurs."
13865,232,1,30,ESTJ,5,<neutrality>  I'm different depending on the situation. The reason is that I become a little nervous when I am pointed out for my actions.
13866,232,1,30,ESTJ,6,"<Yes>  Rather than blindly trying to talk to a new person, I try to have a conversation after observing a little while talking to someone I already know. The reason is that people who have a mind similar to mine to some extent have a common subject matter."
13867,232,1,30,ESTJ,7,"<Yes> Rather than finishing one perfectly, I try to do other things after finishing the amount I set myself. The reason is that if you don't do that, you keep thinking about the unfinished task and you can't concentrate well due to the pressure to finish the second task quickly."
13868,232,1,30,ESTJ,8,<no>  I am a very unsentimental and too realist person. The reason is because I think it's important to benefit me now or in the near future.
13869,232,1,30,ESTJ,9,"<Yes> I'm not up to the details, but I write to-do lists. If I don't write down the reason, I feel like I just spent the day doing nothing today."
13870,232,1,30,ESTJ,10,<no>  I just think that anyone can make mistakes and move on lightly. There's no particular reason.
13871,232,1,30,ESTJ,11,"<neutrality> It depends on the type of gathering, but generally I am good at talking to people I am interested in. I tend to talk to people who seem to have a similar disposition to me without knowing it, but I try to find common ground by asking them if they like the things I like."
13872,232,1,30,ESTJ,12,"<Yes>  I just say that a picture is a picture, a song is a song, how did you come up with that idea?, and the idea is good. The reason is that everyone has their own interpretation of the work, so I don't feel the need to discuss it."
13873,232,1,30,ESTJ,13,"<Yes>  I often hear that it is too much. However, I do not understand why I have to listen to such words when I have only done acts that do not deviate from the standard of life in the world, but everyone feels and thinks differently, so I think it would be nice not to force it."
13874,232,1,30,ESTJ,14,"<neutrality>  don't set a detailed schedule, only a rough schedule. For example, in a travel destination, only the days to go to areas a, b, and c and restaurants are set, and the detailed schedule for the day is set while drinking beer the night before, the morning of the day, or while on the move."
13875,232,1,30,ESTJ,15,"<neutrality>  I think about how others will see me, but I don't care much about what other people think of me if it's how I dress or what I do that doesn't deviate from basic norms. The reason is because I think it's okay not to harm others."
13876,232,1,30,ESTJ,16,"<Yes>  I'm more excited to rumble in a group, so something feels good. These days, I don't have time to meet 1:1 friends, so it's just a pity."
13877,232,1,30,ESTJ,17,<no>  I don't like books and movies where you can interpret the ending in your own way. I like stories that have a clear end. The open ending is kind of awkward.
13878,232,1,30,ESTJ,18,"<no>  don't get any greater satisfaction from helping others succeed. I think the reason is because I don't feel sick to my stomach when people do well in general, but I think it's because I'm a person with a tendency to envy."
13879,232,1,30,ESTJ,19,"<no>  Even if I have a lot of interests, I figure out what I need first and start with that. So I can't remember any experience that wasn't like that."
13880,232,1,30,ESTJ,20,"<no>  don't often worry about things going wrong. The reason is that if you start worrying, you won't be able to do other things, so you forget about it and find what you need to do."
13881,232,1,30,ESTJ,21,"<no>  I enjoy being a leader in a group. The reason is because if I do something, I want to show that I have been here."
13882,232,1,30,ESTJ,22,<Yes>  I think I have very little artistic inclination. The reason is that I am not very interested in seeing or doing things such as paintings and music.
13883,232,1,30,ESTJ,23,"<Yes>  I think the world would be a better place if people valued reason. The reason is because I think the world will look a little cold, but it won't be noisy."
13884,232,1,30,ESTJ,24,<Yes>  I like to finish my chores before going to bed. The reason is that I have to finish my chores and take a break or else I feel like neither one nor the other.
13885,232,1,30,ESTJ,25,<Yes>  I enjoy looking at other people's arguments. The reason is that it was refreshing to hear lines I didn't expect.
13886,232,1,30,ESTJ,26,"<no>  I tend to try to get other people's attention. The reason is as follows. I enjoy wearing primary colors, and there are things that suit me well, but I think I want everyone to know that I am here."
13887,232,1,30,ESTJ,27,"<Yes>  My emotions change quickly. If it's hectic and cluttered, I can't stand it and get annoyed, but when it comes to a person or situation I like, I calm down as if it never happened."
13888,232,1,30,ESTJ,28,"<Yes>  get annoyed when I see people who are not effective. The second semester started and I needed a list of people taking classes with me, so I inquired at the department office, and they said there was only a list of people taking classes in 2022. They say that they will mark people who do not listen to the second semester on the list for 2022, but it is frustrating. I am in my second semester now, and I have an experience that says, ¡°How are you going to work if there is no separate list?¡±"
13889,232,1,30,ESTJ,29,"<no>  I try to finish what I have to do as quickly as possible. Recently, I put off things that I don't really want to do or things that don't pose a problem for my livelihood."
13890,232,1,30,ESTJ,30,"<no>  I have no idea about the question of the afterlife. The reason is that there are many other fun things, but I don't know if I should pay attention to them."
13891,232,1,30,ESTJ,31,"<Yes>  I would rather spend time with other people than alone time. These days, I want to spend more time with other people. It's nice to be alone, but it's so boring when no one responds to me."
13892,232,1,30,ESTJ,32,"<Yes>  I think original stories are boring. As for the reason, I think why do I have to tell a story that is not necessary and does not help much in living."
13893,232,1,30,ESTJ,33,"<no>  I don't easily empathize with people whose backgrounds are completely different from mine. There is no one like me in the world, and even my family is all different, so they say that there are people like that."
13894,232,1,30,ESTJ,34,"<no>  I don't put off making decisions until the end. All decisions are made as quickly as possible. Otherwise, I can't do anything else because I keep thinking about it."
13895,232,1,30,ESTJ,35,<Yes>  I tend not to rethink decisions I have already made. The reason is because you think you've already made the best choice.
13896,232,1,30,ESTJ,36,<Yes>  prefer spending time with friends rather than spending time alone. But these days I can't because of my busy schedule.
13897,232,1,30,ESTJ,37,"<no>  I don't like going to art galleries. I can go if someone asks to go with me, but I don't enjoy it. Because it's no fun."
13898,232,1,30,ESTJ,38,"<Yes>  I often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings. Watching the news about floods and uproar in the house, I tend to say, ¡°Oh, that¡¯s a pity, it must be difficult.¡±"
13899,232,1,30,ESTJ,39,"<Yes>  I like to plan my daily to-dos. The reason is that if you write down what you have to do every day and check it, you feel like you haven't spent the day in vain."
13900,232,1,30,ESTJ,40,"<no>  There are times when I feel insecure. However, if you are in a situation where you cannot avoid being anxious, you pretend not to be."
13901,232,1,30,ESTJ,41,"<Yes>  would like to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible. It's okay if there's a clear reason for it, but it's hard to tolerate the blankness and silence when you're on the phone without saying anything."
13902,232,1,30,ESTJ,42,<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand when opinions differ from mine.
13903,232,1,30,ESTJ,43,"<neutrality>  It depends on who I am. Depending on the person you meet, there are people who talk a lot and people who are awkward. Whenever I meet someone I don't feel awkward with, I always contact them first."
13904,232,1,30,ESTJ,44,"<no>  Even if my plans are disrupted, I will not go back. Just from the moment the plan is wrong, I make a new plan inside. If a guest stays longer than I expected, or if I can¡¯t do what I wanted to do, I prioritize it and only do that."
13905,232,1,30,ESTJ,45,"<no>  don't have many regrets about the mistakes I made a long time ago. If I had to pick one time to go back, I would regret that I should have studied hard in high school."
13906,232,1,30,ESTJ,46,<no>  I tend not to think. Why should I even think about it? I have a lot of other things to think about.
13907,232,1,30,ESTJ,47,"<neutrality>  I tend to control myself well before alcohol gets involved. But when you drink alcohol, you get swayed a lot by your emotions. I wonder where these moody people came from."
13908,232,1,30,ESTJ,48,"<no>  I am the one who points out the other person's faults when they are obvious. The other person's fault is obvious, so why save face?"
13921,233,1,40,ENFP,1,"<neutrality>  I like to approach first and say hello, but I have an introverted side, so it's awkward to make new friends regularly."
13922,233,1,40,ENFP,2,"<Yes>  spend a lot of my free time doing what I want to do. Now that housewives are interested in finances, time flies when I buy books and search online all day looking for a side job for housewives."
13923,233,1,40,ENFP,3,<Yes>  I'm good at empathizing with other people's feelings. I was so sad when I read the story of a person who had an accident due to a typhoon not long ago that I even cried. I also tried to see if there was any way I could be of help.
13924,233,1,40,ENFP,4,"<no>  Actually, I'm a bit spontaneous. First of all, I act with the thought that things will go well, but when things go wrong, I get very embarrassed. However, I tend to avoid crises by demonstrating my quickness."
13925,233,1,40,ENFP,5,"<neutrality> In a high-pressure environment, I try to keep my composure first, but as a person who is influenced by my emotions, it is difficult to maintain my composure all the time, so I end up revealing my emotions as they are. My grandfather passed away not too long ago, so I dealt with urgent matters and at the end I cried out loud by myself because I was sad."
13926,233,1,40,ENFP,6,"<no>  I get nervous when I meet new people, but I tend to introduce myself with a smile. Meeting and talking to people I don't know is exciting, and I always communicate with people who have the same interests."
13927,233,1,40,ENFP,7,"<no>  I like to do things. I can't even do housework in order, and I clean the worst place today as I feel like, take a break according to my own standards, and then proceed again. It handles everything, but tends to fizzle out a bit at the end."
13928,233,1,40,ENFP,8,"<Yes>  I think I enjoy the seasons a lot. When it comes to fall, I get intoxicated with the feeling of fall and go to a place with a good atmosphere, for some reason I become more emotional that day and do things I didn't want to do."
13929,233,1,40,ENFP,9,"<no>  I'm actually a person who thinks no plan is planned. Maybe that's why I always buy a diary, and even though I write diligently in the beginning, there are many times when I spend the day doing things I don't intend."
13930,233,1,40,ENFP,10,"<no>  I think everyone can make small mistakes. My skills may be lacking, but I think I think more positively and try harder by encouraging myself that I can do better. While receiving data labeling training recently, I thought about why I couldn¡¯t do this because my progress was slow and I couldn¡¯t work quickly, but as I worked hard thinking that I would do well if I continued, my work speed gradually increased."
13931,233,1,40,ENFP,11,"<Yes>  I tend to smile and approach without hesitation and talk to people I am interested in, especially when gathering or acting in common interests. Not everyone can like me, but I think there may be people I can't talk to first and try talking to them. In the past, during the university entrance ceremony, I talked to a child who seemed to be in the same department, took classes together, and became close friends."
13932,233,1,40,ENFP,12,"<no>  I like to hear and empathize with what people have to say. When I talk with people who have different thoughts than I do, I can come to know various thoughts that I hadn't thought of. I think that experience is very important to me."
13933,233,1,40,ENFP,13,"<no>  guess I'm a very emotional person. It's rationally correct, but emotionally it's often uncomfortable. I act emotionally in everything, and there are cases where I fight a lot with my thoroughly rational husband. My husband's words are the best at the moment, but emotionally, there are things I want to go a little softer."
13934,233,1,40,ENFP,14,"<neutrality>  like to improvise and do what I want to do, and that's how I've lived. However, after starting a family, having a child, and becoming a mother, there are many times when I shouldn¡¯t act like that. So these days, I try to plan and execute my daily schedule to some extent, but my nature is still to improvise and suddenly change plans. according to my mood."
13935,233,1,40,ENFP,15,"<no>  think I've been trying to have a good self that others think of me. I'm timid on the inside, but I feel the happiest when others tell me that I'm a good person who is bright and listens well. Now I look back on myself and think about living for myself, but it's still hard to ignore other people's attention."
13936,233,1,40,ENFP,16,"<Yes>  like group activities. Even during my school days, I loved being with my peers, older sisters, and younger siblings through various club activities. Maybe it's because of that tendency, but because of the corona virus, I was alone at home, so I felt a lot of depressive feelings."
13937,233,1,40,ENFP,17,"<no>  hate open ending books, dramas and movies. It's good to have a good ending or a clear ending, but these days, if it's fun with an open ending, I'll come up with a second story. I like one tight story. Not too long ago, I happened to see a movie called ""Don't Cry Mommy"" and it made me feel very sad, but the story that a mother takes care of things that cannot be judged by the law even though it is impossible in reality was very exciting."
13938,233,1,40,ENFP,18,"<neutrality>  feel more proud and happy when others do well. So, until I was single, I used to help other people do well. Since the child was born, my child's comfort is more important, so I thought that I should succeed myself, but I am still busy with other people's work."
13939,233,1,40,ENFP,19,"<Yes> There are so many things I want to do these days. I am concerned about the children's education, and I am still thinking about whether there is a way to do the household chores that I am still clumsy at. I feel like I'm just touching my phone. The first step is to look at myself step by step, but I keep looking for this and that, but I don't think there's anything practical."
13940,233,1,40,ENFP,20,"<neutrality> If there is a big issue, I think in my heart what to do if this goes wrong, but I don¡¯t think I express it well outwardly. I tend to try to change my mind while constantly saying that it will be fine. I'm still going through the hurdles well without any major mistakes, so I try to think more positively."
13941,233,1,40,ENFP,21,"<neutrality> When I take on the role of a leader, I have to do things that I don't want to do and things that are bothersome, so I want to avoid it as much as possible, but there are many times when I think that I want to take on the role and make it a good experience. So I don't go first, but when someone appoints me and takes over, I work hard to comfort the people around me and work together."
13942,233,1,40,ENFP,22,"<no>  guess I'm an artistic person with little realistic inclination. Seeing as I like things that are slightly crooked or clumsy more than things that fit the standard. I'm still clumsy, not knowing how to express my inclination artistically, but I'm an artistic person who doesn't notice the passage of time and concentrates on drawing and making things with my hands."
13943,233,1,40,ENFP,23,"<no>  think emotions and reason should coexist similarly. If a world that values reason is a better world, AI should control humans, right? However, I think that because I have feelings that other animals or machines do not have, I think that the world can be warmer and cover the dark side with a bright side. In the event of a forest fire or disaster victims, it is important to provide financial support and restoration, but comfort is also needed more than anything else for the injured."
13944,233,1,40,ENFP,24,"<no>  think I am influenced a lot by my mood. If you want to finish it now no matter what, put your phone away and start doing housework, but when the most urgent task is over and you have more to do, you are tempted to take a break and do it."
13945,233,1,40,ENFP,25,"<no>  I am uncomfortable with other people's arguments. It's so much fun to sympathize with me and share similar feelings, but I'm easily hurt by the other person's dissenting opinion, so I prefer to talk in a place where there are many people who sympathize with me rather than argue."
13946,233,1,40,ENFP,26,"<neutrality>  I think it's because I have a flushed face, so when I attract someone's attention, my face turns red, so I don't like people's gazes. Nevertheless, I like receiving sympathy from others, so it's sad if you're not interested."
13947,233,1,40,ENFP,27,"<neutrality>  am a person who constantly tries to maintain good emotions without major emotional changes. However, as I was raising a child, a lot of embarrassing things happened that I hadn't thought of, so I think my emotions changed very quickly. I think parenting changes me a lot."
13948,233,1,40,ENFP,28,"<no>  I tend to think that it can. Because me and other people may have different likes or are good at each other. That person can fill in my lacking parts later, so I tend to try to complete the work while helping each other as much as possible."
13949,233,1,40,ENFP,29,"<neutrality>  When I have work to do, I tend to put it off until the end. However, if you play the role of a mother, someday it will all become a mother's job and the situation becomes more difficult, so these days, I'm trying to do it first to show the children what to do."
13950,233,1,40,ENFP,30,"<Yes>  I am a person with a lot of imagination and thoughts. As a result, I think I am thinking about the afterlife or imagining it because I am interested in it. It's also fun to talk to people who have such crazy ideas. I am very curious about how I will live after death and whether I am connected to the people around me who are living now."
13951,233,1,40,ENFP,31,"<neutrality>  In the past, I was always depressed when I was alone, so I liked meeting many people and chatting while eating delicious food. But after that, there were many times when that time was wasted. These days, I think it's more meaningful to think about my future and find my job in my alone time, so I've had a lot of alone time."
13952,233,1,40,ENFP,32,"<Yes>  There were many times when I thought I wanted to fix my tendency, but it didn't work out. I think theory-centered discussions and stories that dig into the basics are boring. I try it first, and when it doesn't work, I go back to the original theory, take it into action, and if it fails, I don't like my tendency to find the cause from the basics, but it doesn't fix it well."
13953,233,1,40,ENFP,33,"<Yes>  I believe that each person has their own circumstances. There are really cool and popular people around you, but if you get to know them, they have one flaw. That's why I don't just envy or criticize, but I think that I am and that person has his or her story. While thinking that it would be better if I was a little more cool person."
13954,233,1,40,ENFP,34,"<no>  I tend to make decisions first and then work. So even when taking a test, I don¡¯t do calculations well, and if I focus on the problem and solve it, I think I move on to the next one and don¡¯t look around again. Then I make small mistakes, but I feel comfortable when I make a decision first and proceed with the work."
13955,233,1,40,ENFP,35,<Yes>  think I'll probably make that decision when I go back. It's because I put my heart into the decision I've already made. That's why I prefer to move forward rather than regret it after checking or thinking over it.
13956,233,1,40,ENFP,36,"<neutrality>  I liked meeting friends and children, eating delicious food, talking, and having fun, but since COVID-19, only my family spends time. I don't want to cause harm to others, and if I get hurt again, I feel resentful for no reason, so I become careful with each other."
13957,233,1,40,ENFP,37,"<Yes>  I like going to art galleries and exhibitions. In the past, I thought it was a place that only people in the know could go to, but these days, there are many good works such as free exhibition halls and musicals, so I look around and go on weekends with the desire to broaden the eyes of children to see the world."
13958,233,1,40,ENFP,38,"<no>  I am good at understanding other people's feelings. When I'm sad, I cry together and read it together, and when I'm happy, I congratulate you, and it motivates me to work harder. If I think like that, I think I can empathize with other people's stories more and feel less uncomfortable when I meet them."
13959,233,1,40,ENFP,39,"<no>  I'm one of those people who think they have to plan their daily to-dos, but never do it. In fact, when raising a child, most of the things don't go as planned, perhaps because there are so many variables. So after that, I think I'll put my hands on my hands and look at the child's feelings and my mood and do things as I see fit."
13960,233,1,40,ENFP,40,"<neutrality>  I think I was always insecure when I was younger. It was because my family was in jeopardy due to my parents' bad work. As time passes and I become a parent, I realize that the world does not always go the way I want, and now that my house has become more stable, I think I am trying to feel happy every day rather than feeling anxious."
13961,233,1,40,ENFP,41,"<no>  For me, I feel frustrated because the feedback doesn't come immediately when I do text messages or e-mails. That's why I prefer to have a clear conversation with the person's feelings over the phone. Even things that can be misunderstood in writing can often be understood through conversation."
13962,233,1,40,ENFP,42,"<no>  When it comes to a person or situation that has a very different opinion from mine, I tend to pass it off as saying that person is like that. If you hold that thought for a long time, you will get angry and feel bad. Instead, I look for more people or articles similar to my opinion. There are many people in the world, so I don't necessarily think they have the same thoughts or opinions as me. Instead, it's in the line that it doesn't harm me."
13963,233,1,40,ENFP,43,"<no>  I act proactively when there is a meeting or meeting, but surprisingly I don't think I try to meet first. I was afraid that my friend might have an appointment or something busy, so I stopped pushing for a meeting with the excuse of being more considerate."
13964,233,1,40,ENFP,44,"<no>  I tend to switch to other plans when plans go awry. Recently, I was able to do a good job, so I was able to go to work, but I was worried because my second child needed a mother so much, and in the end, I canceled and found a side job at home. At first, the situation was difficult, but I accepted it and decided to think slowly. I found out that there is another way. Right now, I plan to focus more on my child."
13965,233,1,40,ENFP,45,"<Yes>  I often think about the mistakes I made in the past. I guess it's because I don't want to make that mistake again. Now that I am looking for work as a full-time housewife, I keep thinking about the mistakes I made to guests when I was working at a hotel in the past, and it bothers me."
13966,233,1,40,ENFP,46,<no>  I think I'm thinking about why I was born and how I should live. That's why I'm constantly telling my children that you are the most important thing and live as you want. Why am I doing something here at this time? So tomorrow will be better.
13967,233,1,40,ENFP,47,"<Yes> I'm sure I'm an emotional person. I feel like I'm being swayed by a lot of emotions. So the thing I'm thinking about the most these days is to catch my mentality. Only when my mentality is upright can I protect my children as a whole mother and as an adult. Also, I think that it is good for mental health to be true to my feelings and to cry when I want to cry and laugh when I want to laugh. Maybe that¡¯s why people around me tend to say that I have a strong mentality."
13968,233,1,40,ENFP,48,"<Yes>  am also a human being who can make mistakes, so I tend not to speak out loud about other people¡¯s faults. That way, next time I make a mistake or make a mistake, there will definitely be a situation where I can go over a little less. I never do anything that threatens my safety, but I tend to think that anyone can make a mistake and move on."
13981,234,1,30,ISFP,1,"<no>  tend to socialize more with people I already know than making new friends on a regular basis. The reason is that when you meet new friends, it feels more comfortable and nice to spend time with your old friends than to introduce yourself and drain your energy."
13982,234,1,30,ISFP,2,"<neutrality>  don't spend much of my free time exploring interests unless I need to know something urgently. However, sometimes, if you are interested in something and want to find out right away, there are times when you spend a lot of time. Currently, I have been adopting a dog for about 6 months, so I am very interested in dog training."
13983,234,1,30,ISFP,3,"<no>  I don't want to cry because I'm influenced by seeing other people cry. Especially if you don't know why that person is crying, you're just curious about the reason and don't want to cry together."
13984,234,1,30,ISFP,4,"<neutrality>  It depends. I feel anxious about really important things that shouldn't go wrong, so I tend to make various preparations, but sometimes I don't want to think about things that won't be a big problem even if they go wrong, so I don't make preparations."
13985,234,1,30,ISFP,5,"<no>  In a high-pressure environment, I tend to get very stressed out, so I try to keep my composure, but I often become irritable and anxious. Recently, in a situation where I had to meet a deadline, other unexpected things kept happening, so I couldn't concentrate on anything, and I was under a lot of stress mentally, and I exploded in anger alone."
13986,234,1,30,ISFP,6,"<Yes>  I prefer to talk to people I already know rather than new people. Especially in the case of a party or event, since many people gather, it is more comfortable to talk with someone close to you."
13987,234,1,30,ISFP,7,"<no> When I start one thing, I'm not the type to finish it first, and I tend to get bored easily. Even if there is a project I started first, if I can't concentrate or get bored, I tend to start another project for a while and work on it alternately."
13988,234,1,30,ISFP,8,"<Yes>  It seems to be more sentimental than rational. Even when watching a drama or a movie, he empathizes well and tends to shed a lot of tears, especially in sad situations."
13989,234,1,30,ISFP,9,"<no> There are times when I think in my head, but more often it's spontaneous, and I don't make specific plans or write them down in a diary or notepad."
13990,234,1,30,ISFP,10,"<no>  tend to think that mistakes are literally mistakes because I have a clumsy personality, and I do not doubt my ability or knowledge. Recently, in a test to participate in a data labeling project, there was a case where I accidentally got a problem wrong, but since it's a project with so many things to understand, I thought it was a mistake because I missed something, so I dismissed it lightly."
13991,234,1,30,ISFP,11,"<no>  I feel a lot of awkwardness and discomfort when approaching someone I don't know, so it's not easy for me to go first and start a conversation even with someone I'm interested in."
13992,234,1,30,ISFP,12,"<Yes>  I'm not very interested in going to art galleries and museums, and I'm not very knowledgeable in the field of art, so I'm not at all interested in discussing different interpretations of works of art."
13993,234,1,30,ISFP,13,"<no>  I don't have severe emotional ups and downs, but I think I tend to follow my emotions more than reason, and the evaluations around me are the same."
13994,234,1,30,ISFP,14,"<Yes>  When a deadline approaches, I tend to rush things or do what I want to do according to the mood of the day, so I prefer doing what I want to do spontaneously rather than planning."
13995,234,1,30,ISFP,15,"<no>  Because I care a lot about how people see me and always think about how I will appear to others, I tend to think and worry about how others will appear to me."
13996,234,1,30,ISFP,16,<no>  I prefer to spend time alone or with a small group of people rather than doing group activities with many people.
13997,234,1,30,ISFP,17,"<no>  I like works such as books and movies with fixed endings rather than open endings. Most of the works have a fixed ending, so there is no work that I particularly liked for this reason, but I do not prefer works that have different interpretations depending on the audience like the movie 'The Wailing'."
13998,234,1,30,ISFP,18,"<neutrality>  In the field I am confident in, I try harder than others to succeed and feel a sense of accomplishment, but in other fields, I also like to feel the satisfaction I get from helping others. I feel proud when others succeed with my help."
13999,234,1,30,ISFP,19,"<no>  I'm not the type to be very interested in many things, so there was never a case where I didn't know what to do next."
14000,234,1,30,ISFP,20,"<no>  On the contrary, we rarely worry about things going wrong because we tend to think that most things will work out."
14001,234,1,30,ISFP,21,"<Yes>  I would rather avoid taking on a leadership role as much as possible, as I prefer to quietly play by the rules in a group rather than step up and lead."
14002,234,1,30,ISFP,22,"<Yes>  don't have much interest in art, and since I was young, I didn't have a talent for art or music, so I think I have little artistic inclination."
14003,234,1,30,ISFP,23,"<Yes>  In recent years, crimes caused by momentary emotions seem to be on the rise, so if reason was more important than emotion, accidental crimes caused by momentary impulses would be less likely to occur and the world would be a little better."
14004,234,1,30,ISFP,24,"<no>  tend to procrastinate and rush things as much as possible, so I want to take a break first and finish my chores."
14005,234,1,30,ISFP,25,"<no>  I feel like I have a pacifist disposition, so I don't like to argue, nor do other people argue."
14006,234,1,30,ISFP,26,"<Yes>  Being in the spotlight in front of a lot of people is embarrassing and embarrassing, so I tend to avoid drawing attention from others."
14007,234,1,30,ISFP,27,"<no>  I tend to follow my emotions more than reason, but I don't have severe emotional ups and downs, such as being in a good mood and then becoming depressed in an instant."
14008,234,1,30,ISFP,28,"<no>  Different people have different personalities and different ways of getting things done, so I don't get annoyed with people who judge me as inefficient."
14009,234,1,30,ISFP,29,"<Yes>  put off what I have to do until I can postpone it as much as possible, and when it becomes unavoidable, I proceed with the work, and concentration and efficiency are the best when I do that."
14010,234,1,30,ISFP,30,"<no>  Sometimes, when I think of and imagine the afterlife, tears come to my eyes. That's why the question of the afterlife doesn't feel exciting."
14011,234,1,30,ISFP,31,"<neutrality> Sometimes I prefer to spend time alone, but these days I spend a lot of time alone, so I also want to spend time with other people."
14012,234,1,30,ISFP,32,"<Yes>  I am not interested in theory-based discussions in areas I am not familiar with or interested in. Previously, I watched my husband and nephew discuss the theory of sexual goodness and evil, but I did not understand the conversation between the two and felt bored."
14013,234,1,30,ISFP,33,"<Yes>  Ever since I was little, I had a good ability to empathize with anyone in any situation. Even if the background is not the same as mine, I tend to put myself in that person¡¯s shoes and easily relate to them."
14014,234,1,30,ISFP,34,"<Yes>  They tend to have difficulty making decisions, and they often put off making decisions until the last minute, keeping in mind the possibility that they might change their minds."
14015,234,1,30,ISFP,35,"<no> In particular, I tend to think about two things for a long time, so even if I make a decision after much thought, I tend to keep thinking about it until the results come out."
14016,234,1,30,ISFP,36,"<no>  Rather than mingling with people and relieving the fatigue of the week at a party or event, I tend to spend time alone quietly."
14017,234,1,30,ISFP,37,<no>  I don't like going to art galleries or places of art because I'm not very interested in looking at art.
14018,234,1,30,ISFP,38,"<no>  Even in situations I don't understand or haven't experienced, I tend to empathize with people's words and situations, so it's never been difficult for me to understand other people's feelings."
14019,234,1,30,ISFP,39,"<no>  Rather than planning and proceeding with both work and personal tasks, I tend to improvise according to various situations and moods of the day."
14020,234,1,30,ISFP,40,"<Yes>  I'm not the type to feel anxious. It seems to be a natural tendency, but because I always have the thought that everything will work out, I don't feel anxious about anything."
14021,234,1,30,ISFP,41,"<Yes>  prefer to communicate via text rather than talking on the phone. In particular, when it comes to conversations with strangers, they are more reluctant to talk on the phone, because it feels more comfortable with a text message that allows them to fully think and answer than a phone call where they have no choice but to answer unexpected questions."
14022,234,1,30,ISFP,42,"<no>  I'm not the type to insist on my opinion, so even if it's a different opinion, if the reason is valid, I'm the type to understand and accept it quickly."
14023,234,1,30,ISFP,43,"<no> It depends on the case, but I'm not the type to contact you to meet first. Even if they contact you first because of something, they just talk about meeting you as a courtesy and don't actively act for a real meeting."
14024,234,1,30,ISFP,44,"<Yes> If my plan is disrupted, I tend to try to get back to it as quickly as possible. If you have to leave the house due to severe separation anxiety for your puppy, you need to find a place to take care of it, but due to the personal circumstances of the person who was originally supposed to take care of it, you suddenly have to look for another place, It wasn't easy, but as a result of planning in various ways, I was able to leave the dog in a good place and come back safely."
14025,234,1,30,ISFP,45,"<no> Sometimes I wonder if I would have made a mistake had I made a different choice at the time, but I think about them often and don't regret it. Also, I don't regret things that are very old."
14026,234,1,30,ISFP,46,"<Yes>  I think that you should think about how to enjoy your life and live happily, so you don't think about philosophical things like human existence and the reason for living."
14027,234,1,30,ISFP,47,"<no>  tend to be emotional rather than rational, but I think I tend to control my emotions well rather than being swayed by them, and the evaluations of those around me are the same."
14028,234,1,30,ISFP,48,"<Yes>  I don't like to be condescending or stand out, so I tend to save face even when it's clear that I'm right and the other person is wrong."
14041,235,0,30,INTP,1,"<no> It seems to be the biggest annoyance. It's hard to spend time with friends next to you, but you don't like shallow relationships, and the actions and conversations you do to maintain relationships seem useless."
14042,235,0,30,INTP,2,"<Yes>  I like to quench my thirst for exploration through YouTube or the Internet, and I am interested in professional knowledge, useless trivial knowledge, theories and philosophies. These days, I am interested in singers and history of pop songs in the 90s."
14043,235,0,30,INTP,3,"<no> That person and I are completely different entities, so I can't feel and understand that person's feelings 100%. If this situation arises, I think I will try to understand the feelings and thoughts of the person after listening to the story."
14044,235,0,30,INTP,4,"<neutrality>  In my case, it seems to be reducing the variables by thinking about various situations rather than a preparation. I don't think I can control everything 100%, so I think I'll handle things according to the situation rather than planning."
14045,235,0,30,INTP,5,"<neutrality>  Generally, I tend to control my emotions, but I think it's important whether or not the pressure environment is justified for me. I hate hurting others, but I also hate being hurt. When you cross the line in valuing individual etiquette or order, you have to say something regardless of the person's social status or age."
14046,235,0,30,INTP,6,"<Yes>  I wonder if I will attend social gatherings. If it were an acquaintance of an acquaintance or someone who has the same interests as me recently, I would try to talk, but if it were me, I wouldn't even say hello to someone I hadn't even met."
14047,235,0,30,INTP,7,"<neutrality>  lose interest quickly when something is out of my interest. When I work, I start several tasks based on my interests, and when a deadline or end date approaches, I am the type to handle them all at once, so I start several things and finish one by one. So I don't make any other plans, but I tend to mark D-Day on my calendar. When I was in school, homework on vacation was like that, and when I was living in society, it was like handling work at a government office or company report."
14048,235,0,30,INTP,8,"<no> It's not sentimental. It's just that I'm clumsy in expressing myself, and I don't like making a fuss by overdoing my emotions more than necessary. But I don't think it's emotionless or dry."
14049,235,0,30,INTP,9,"<no>  I don't like making plans. If it happens within a day, I think about the order of things, but I hate planning by hours or days. At the end of the year, the company diary or calendar is always new. I think it's such a useless thing."
14050,235,0,30,INTP,10,"<no> Most mistakes or mistakes come at a cost. It is a loss if you have already paid the price and blame yourself. I don't think there is a perfect human being, so I don't doubt my ability or knowledge with a small mistake. Rather, I think it is a true human being to admit mistakes and make them experience. Not too long ago, I misrepresented the knowledge I knew, but I quickly admitted it and accepted the new knowledge."
14051,235,0,30,INTP,11,"<no> If you are interested, I think you will approach me without difficulty because I am someone who has something that I am interested in. Most of them were difficult at first, but once you got into your own boundaries, you quickly became friends. Of course, this situation itself is rare."
14052,235,0,30,INTP,12,"<no>  I'm very interested. Because if there are 100 people, there are 100 people's thoughts and methods. It's really interesting and fun to listen to or discuss things I hadn't thought of or thoughts from completely different perspectives. In that respect, I think the Internet is the best invention."
14053,235,0,30,INTP,13,"<neutrality>  I tend to follow reason. In all problems, there is no problem that emotions can solve. However, there are some things that reason cannot solve. If the opponent is illogical and reckless, I make it difficult for myself to be rational until the end."
14054,235,0,30,INTP,14,"<Yes>  do what I want to improvise rather than plan. I simply list things to do and improvise or put them in order according to the time. I set a goal for this summer vacation, but I didn't have a schedule at all."
14055,235,0,30,INTP,15,"<Yes>  I'm not worried. Because those people have nothing to do with me. That doesn't mean I want to live like a madman. My family, friends, and people around me would consider it, but I'm worried about how I look. It's because I'm not worried about how others see me."
14056,235,0,30,INTP,16,<no>  I don't like group activities. Because I like things that I can do alone and I feel comfortable doing things alone. I don't feel the need to work with anyone.
14057,235,0,30,INTP,17,"<Yes>  I like books and movies that stimulate my imagination. I am grateful to the writers and directors who helped me to think this way and that on my own. I haven't seen any movies or books lately, so I can't remember, but I think I enjoyed watching Parasite."
14058,235,0,30,INTP,18,"<no>  I am not interested in helping others succeed or work. People around me would think deeply and consider it, but my own success is unknown, so I don't think I can think of helping others. I'm not that selfless."
14059,235,0,30,INTP,19,"<Yes>  consider myself to be the type of person who knows a lot and is shallow. I have a lot of YouTube and books such as biological documentaries, earth science, and space, and I am very interested in foreign pop music in the 90s, so I often go to Dongmyo or Jongno 3-ga to buy cassettes or LPs."
14060,235,0,30,INTP,20,<Yes>  I have a lot of thoughts and worries. You are probably immersed in worries and thoughts that you do not have to do except for sleeping time. I want to know if there is a reason or reason. just this is me
14061,235,0,30,INTP,21,"<Yes>  am not the vessel to be the leader of a group or meeting. This is because they do not have the charisma to lead the group, nor the driving force nor the cause. I am not very interested in this one. Anyway, there are people who want to stand out in this position, so you can leave it to those people."
14062,235,0,30,INTP,22,"<no>  Every human being has a desire to create. I believe everyone has artistic inclinations. Whether it's popular or trendy is a separate issue. I also have an art soul. Sometimes when I draw pictures or make Legos, I think so."
14063,235,0,30,INTP,23,"<neutrality>  I don't think I can say with 100% that the world would have been a better place if rationality had been emphasized. Sometimes things happen in the world that cannot be explained by rational logic. If rational conclusions were drawn at that time, it might be a more controlled and restrained world than it is now."
14064,235,0,30,INTP,24,"<neutrality>  think I can take a break after being organized to some extent. This is because if the surroundings are cluttered, even if you rest, you will not feel as if you have rested. Even though it's hard, it's not perfect, but I think it needs to be organized to some extent."
14065,235,0,30,INTP,25,"<Yes>  It's fun to watch other people's arguments. Like I said before, it's fun to hear what someone thinks. It's fun to think that it's an opportunity to hear perspectives and thoughts that I didn't think of, and that it's something that could happen to me in the future as well, what would I have done if it were me."
14066,235,0,30,INTP,26,<Yes>  I see no reason to draw anyone's attention. I don't even understand what base they're thinking of attracting attention to.
14067,235,0,30,INTP,27,"<Yes>  I think my emotions change very quickly because I have a lot of thoughts. However, the intensity of those emotions is very minor and is not expressed outwardly. Because it's a small and useless feeling. For example, from worrying about tonight to seriously worrying about the environment of the earth."
14068,235,0,30,INTP,28,"<Yes>  To be honest, I think of myself as an ordinary person rather than efficient. But when I see people who are worse than me or who don't have a job, I get frustrated and annoyed. I thought about that sometimes when I was watching people working at other workplaces. Of course, it's not my job, so I quickly gave up."
14069,235,0,30,INTP,29,"<Yes> postpone until the end That way, the efficiency of work increases. I feel catharsis when I rush and time flies by. It was like that recently when I was writing an application for banking or something."
14070,235,0,30,INTP,30,"<Yes>  afterlife. Even just hearing the words is interesting. With just this one word, you can talk about religion, history, or philosophy. Frankly, it doesn't matter if there is an afterlife or not. It's just a pleasure to be able to talk about this."
14071,235,0,30,INTP,31,<no>  The total amount of energy varies from person to person. Even the charging method seems to be different. I myself consume energy by meeting someone and recharge energy by spending time alone. Spending time alone is comfortable and enjoyable.
14072,235,0,30,INTP,32,<no> Theory-based discussion is very important. You can talk about unforeseen situations or problems just by talking about this and that in advance. Things that have not been discussed in advance may become a problem due to unexpected circumstances.
14073,235,0,30,INTP,33,"<Yes>  It's not hard to empathize. Even if the background knowledge is different, I think it is easy to empathize if you talk enough about the person and take the time to get to know him."
14074,235,0,30,INTP,34,"<neutrality> It seems to be different depending on what it is from time to time. Because there are problems that need to be chosen carefully, and the more late the choice, the harder it is. Normally, I would think hard and choose at the end."
14075,235,0,30,INTP,35,"<no>  I tend to think a lot about decisions I have already made. Because my choices can change due to unknown circumstances or variables, I tend to think again."
14076,235,0,30,INTP,36,<no> They are not interested in social gatherings such as fun parties and events. Relieve fatigue with alone time. Social gatherings are rather tiring and I think it will interfere with the next week.
14077,235,0,30,INTP,37,"<Yes>  Likes. I tend to go to exhibitions of my favorite artists, from classic works to recent ones. I tend to collect small items that are not expensive."
14078,235,0,30,INTP,38,"<Yes> Difficulty understanding other people's feelings I try to understand, but I don't know what to do with emotions or reactions that are more intense than I imagined. There are many times when I don't understand, such as the strong response of a light joke or the sobbing in a movie or drama."
14079,235,0,30,INTP,39,"<no>  Do not plan what to do every day. Just hearing the word ¡°plan¡± makes my throat ache. In terms of business flow, I don't make a plan, but I will try to follow it, and personal things are unplanned."
14080,235,0,30,INTP,40,"<no>  feel insecure If you ask me if it feels big, I don¡¯t think it is. If you say you feel it often, you feel it often. I have a lot of thoughts and think about this and that, so that kind of feeling comes out. Conversely, there are cases in which anxiety is lowered by other thoughts."
14081,235,0,30,INTP,41,"<neutrality> In the past, phone calls were burdensome, but these days I want to avoid KakaoTalk or social media more. When I speak, I need to organize my thoughts and the order is important, but there were times when I couldn't think of anything to say when I tried to talk in real time. But these days, texts are also used in real time, so sometimes it's better to just talk on the phone and hang up."
14082,235,0,30,INTP,42,"<Yes>  Other comments are interesting. But wrong opinions are not interesting. I'll admit I'm wrong, but I want to correct what I don't know confidently. Because of that, there are parts of me that I know about, and I like it."
14083,235,0,30,INTP,43,<no>  I don't contact my friends to meet up first. They don't even contact you in the first place. It's really annoying. I'm glad my friends understand this too. It's fun when you get pulled over.
14084,235,0,30,INTP,44,"<Yes>  I will try to get back as soon as possible. I like getting things done at once, but I hate it when things go wrong. I don't like to get in the way of my work."
14085,235,0,30,INTP,45,"<Yes>  It's like taking a mistake into your heart. It is also a promise that it will not happen again in the future, and I often think about the mistakes and actions I made in the past."
14086,235,0,30,INTP,46,"<no>  I think a lot about the reason for human existence and life. Among many human beings, I constantly think about what I can do, what I can achieve, and what I need to become a better human being."
14087,235,0,30,INTP,47,"<no>  I tend to control my emotions rather than being swayed by them. If you do it emotionally, things that can be solved will not be solved. Rather, people around me seem to ask if I am calm in this situation."
14088,235,0,30,INTP,48,<no>  I don't save face when the other person's fault is obvious and clear. What is wrong is wrong and what needs to be corrected must be corrected. It only makes those who save face become advocates.
14101,236,1,30,ESFJ,1,<no>  I don't enjoy making new friends very much. I tend to enjoy spending more time with a few like-minded close friends.
14102,236,1,30,ESFJ,2,"<neutrality>  When I have free time, I usually enjoy my hobbies. These days, I have a lot of interest in travel destinations that I haven't been to often."
14103,236,1,30,ESFJ,3,"<Yes> It seems that you are good at empathizing with the heart of the other person who is crying. I feel like the other person's feelings are conveyed intact, so there are many times when tears come out together."
14104,236,1,30,ESFJ,4,"<no>  I'm not the type to make preparations. If you don't have confidence from the beginning, you don't start well, so you rarely worry or make preparations in advance."
14105,236,1,30,ESFJ,5,"<Yes>  tend to try to keep my composure. There's a lot of pressure from competing with other employees in the company, but I don't want to appear that way in the eyes of others, so I try to pretend I'm okay."
14106,236,1,30,ESFJ,6,<Yes>  I like to talk to people I know. I tend not to make a relationship unless I am very shy and I really want to get to know and be close to someone.
14107,236,1,30,ESFJ,7,"<Yes>  try to finish what I have already started as early as possible. If it's not urgent, I tend to finish the project I have in hand before starting other work."
14108,236,1,30,ESFJ,8,"<neutrality>  To some extent, I think it's sentimental. They tend to be easygoing in their own affairs, but are often easily excitable or sentimental in those of their families."
14109,236,1,30,ESFJ,9,<Yes> Planning is important. He is a person who thinks that it is absolutely necessary to make plans such as important schedules or monthly goals and keep them.
14110,236,1,30,ESFJ,10,"<neutrality>  Sometimes it is. There was a time when I pushed ahead with the knowledge I knew due to a disagreement with a colleague, but when I found out that I was wrong, my faith in myself was broken and I was very frustrated."
14111,236,1,30,ESFJ,11,"<neutrality>  tend to approach people who are interested to some extent first. When I was sure that I would be compatible with this person, I was the first to approach without hesitation."
14112,236,1,30,ESFJ,12,<Yes>  I wasn't interested in discussing works of art per se. I have no interest in anything I don't like.
14113,236,1,30,ESFJ,13,"<neutrality>  guess I'm half and half. I try to act rationally as much as possible, but there are times when my emotions take precedence, so there are times when I get in trouble. People around me often say that they think of me as being very rational in important matters."
14114,236,1,30,ESFJ,14,"<neutrality>  I like to do things spontaneously. However, I try to move as plannedly as possible. When it is judged to be really important to me, I act unconditionally with a plan, and there are times when I am improvised in private matters such as meeting friends."
14115,236,1,30,ESFJ,15,"<no>  I tend to worry a lot about how I look in the eyes of others. As I raise my children, I always worry about what kind of person I will appear in their eyes as a good parent."
14116,236,1,30,ESFJ,16,"<Yes>  I prefer a noisy and fun time than a quiet atmosphere. That's why I often participate in places where many people gather, group dinners, and gatherings."
14117,236,1,30,ESFJ,17,"<no>  I like books and movies with a fixed ending. I don't like the open ending because it seems like it ends in vain, and I guess how the story will unfold, but in the end, it's good to have a clear ending. That's why I really liked Reply 1988."
14118,236,1,30,ESFJ,18,"<Yes>  find great satisfaction in helping others succeed. When I work with attachment to the company I belong to, I have a desire for this company to develop further, and I work harder, and as a result, I think it is helping others succeed."
14119,236,1,30,ESFJ,19,"<no>  I'm trying to be faithful to my current life and I'm living like that, so I don't have many interests. Currently, I do not pay much attention to other things to the extent that I have no other interests besides family and travel."
14120,236,1,30,ESFJ,20,<neutrality>  think I tend to worry a little when I'm doing something I'm not confident about. There is no reason or reason.
14121,236,1,30,ESFJ,21,"<Yes>  I try to avoid leadership roles in groups whenever possible. I don't tend to get close to people who are shy and uncomfortable, so when I worked as a member of the community, there were many times when my work performance was better."
14122,236,1,30,ESFJ,22,"<Yes>  think the artistic inclination is close to 0%. Even during my school days, I was always not confident in creativity or art activities, and the results were not particularly good."
14123,236,1,30,ESFJ,23,"<no>  I don't think so. Rather, I often think that it would be better if I responded emotionally when I saw people who suffered unfortunate things or came across such articles."
14124,236,1,30,ESFJ,24,"<Yes>  I tend to finish the housework first. It's because when you finish your chores, you can relax in a relaxed state."
14125,236,1,30,ESFJ,25,<Yes>  I enjoy looking at other people's arguments. This is because I learn a lot by listening to words and contents I hadn't thought of.
14126,236,1,30,ESFJ,26,"<Yes>  I tend to do my best not to attract other people's attention. This is because when you receive someone's gaze, you feel uncomfortable and often make mistakes in the things you used to do well to get out of the situation."
14127,236,1,30,ESFJ,27,<no> Emotional changes are not that great. They are not very agitated by their surroundings.
14128,236,1,30,ESFJ,28,"<neutrality>  It's not uncommon for me to get annoyed unless it's an emergency. Even at the company, if a newcomer makes the same mistake as me, I rather want to help him and suggest a way to do well."
14129,236,1,30,ESFJ,29,"<no> If there is work to be done, I try to get it done as quickly as possible. No matter how hard it is, it's better to finish it quickly and rest, so I'm still on the side of finishing my work as quickly as possible."
14130,236,1,30,ESFJ,30,"<Yes>  I'm so intrigued. I've never experienced it, and I'm curious and curious because no one knows if such a world really exists."

14222,238,0,20,ISTJ,2,"<Yes>  devote a significant part of my free time to composing.

I like it."
14230,238,0,20,ISTJ,10,"<Yes>  often doubt my ability or knowledge even with small mistakes. The reason was that there was a group reservation at the restaurant, but my mistake was that the table was confused and the guests could not sit down.

14231,238,0,20,ISTJ,11,"<Yes> It's not difficult for me to approach and strike up a conversation with someone I'm interested in. The reason is that before I went to the military, I was very timid and it was difficult to talk to women, but after I came back, if there was a girl I really liked, I would talk to her before someone else took her away.

14232,238,0,20,ISTJ,12,"<Yes>  am not interested in debating the different interpretations of works of art.

14236,238,0,20,ISTJ,16,"<no>  I do not enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is that I like being alone, and I don't like being noticed if I make a mistake after participating in a group activity."
14237,238,0,20,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I don't like books and movies where you can interpret the ending in your own way. The reason is that in the case of an open ending, I like the work with an ending because I feel like I was shitting and then stopped. There are no recent favorites."
14238,238,0,20,ISTJ,18,"<no>  find no greater satisfaction in helping others succeed than myself. The reason is that it is difficult to make a living, but there is no time to take care of others. I think I have to succeed first so that I can afford to live, and then I can help."

14240,238,0,20,ISTJ,20,"<Yes>  I am often worried that things will go wrong. The reason is that I have been noticed by people because of my mistakes, so I do my best about work, but I am still anxious and worried."
14241,238,0,20,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid taking on a leadership role in a group whenever possible. The reason is because there is a lot to do, there are responsibilities, and it is annoying. It is difficult to speak in front of others because of my timid nature."
14242,238,0,20,ISTJ,22,"<neutrality>  I consider myself to have some artistic inclinations. The reason is that my father also liked to play the acoustic guitar from a young age and even tried to write songs. Although he doesn't have great talent, he has a good sense of rhythm."
14243,238,0,20,ISTJ,23,"<Yes>  think the world would be a better place if people valued reason over emotion. The reason is emotional, so there are many things that accidentally kill people, and there are many things that hurt people, so if it was rational, I think at least criminal acts would decrease."
14244,238,0,20,ISTJ,24,"<no>  I don't want to finish my chores before taking a break. The reason is that I have a bit of a lazy personality, so I prefer to clean up when I exceed the tolerance I thought."
14245,238,0,20,ISTJ,25,"<Yes>  I enjoy watching other people's arguments. The reason is that among those who fight, there are those who win and those who lose, but if it is not related to me, I think whoever wins can be seen as a fun factor."

14249,238,0,20,ISTJ,29,"<no>  don't often put things off until the end. The reason is that if I can't get things done on time, my self-esteem goes down, and I have a lot of anxiety about that, so when I have something to do, I tend to do it on time."
14250,238,0,20,ISTJ,30,"<Yes>  I think the question of the afterlife is interesting. The reason is that people say that people go to heaven or hell after they die, but when I listen to the stories of people who died and came back to life, I am curious about their experiences of seeing a completely different world."
14251,238,0,20,ISTJ,31,"<Yes>  I would rather spend time with other people than alone. The reason is that in the past, it didn't matter if I was alone, but these days I feel very lonely, and there are many times when I want to have a beer together while looking at the sea."
14252,238,0,20,ISTJ,32,"<no> I'm not interested in theory-based discussions, and I don't find principled stories boring. I think it's important because everything started from the basics.

14254,238,0,20,ISTJ,34,"<no>  I'm not one to put off making decisions until the end. The reason is usually decided on the spot, but if something needs to be corrected, it can be changed flexibly at that time. Especially when writing songs, I go if I feel like this is right, and there are many things I fix after making it."
14255,238,0,20,ISTJ,35,<no>  tend to rethink decisions I have already made. The reason is that I tend to revisit even the smallest things in order to reexamine whether there have been any mistakes.
14256,238,0,20,ISTJ,36,"<no>  Rather than spending time alone, I do not relieve the fatigue of the week with fun parties and events. The reason is that when I go to places with a lot of people, I feel more comfortable having free time alone because I feel tired and hectic."
14257,238,0,20,ISTJ,37,"<neutrality>  I am not a fan of museums or art works. The reason is intuitively, I like to see the atmosphere coming out of the painting, but I don't go and see it. I like to appreciate musical works."

14260,238,0,20,ISTJ,40,"<no>  I often feel insecure. The reason is that there is nothing I am good at, so I often think that it will be difficult to get a job even if I study.

14261,238,0,20,ISTJ,41,"<no>  would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that when I was young, I was afraid to talk to anyone, and I stuttered, but now I learned social life while working part-time and met a lot of people, so it became natural."
14262,238,0,20,ISTJ,42,"<no>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that are very different from my own. The reason is that each person has different values, and they cannot be the same, so I try to understand. You don't seem to have any experience."
14263,238,0,20,ISTJ,43,"<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends to meet up first. The reason is that my friends are also kids who like to be alone, and if there is nothing to do at home, I usually contact them first and ask them to play."
14264,238,0,20,ISTJ,44,"<Yes> If my plan is disrupted, I try to get back to it as quickly as possible. The reason is that when my grandmother passed away, I had a funeral for 3 days and I had to submit the assignments given by the academy, so I tend to do it right away to catch up with others."
14265,238,0,20,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  I often regret mistakes made long ago. The reason sometimes comes out in dreams when you sleep, and sometimes similar situations appear when you make mistakes in your daily life. It's happened more often these days, but it reminds me of trauma."
14266,238,0,20,ISTJ,46,"<neutrality>  I've been thinking a little bit about human existence and why we live. As for the reason, there have been times when I have wondered without looking into why humans exist on earth, whether they exist for reasons such as to eat and live, to breed offspring, etc."
14267,238,0,20,ISTJ,47,"<Yes>  tend to be swayed by my emotions rather than controlling them.

14291,239,0,20,ESFP,11,"<neutrality>  I had hardly ever thought that I would be interested and want to talk to that person. If you're really interested, I'm confident to approach you, but I think you'll be afraid."
14292,239,0,20,ESFP,12,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in interpreting works of art. It's boring stuff for me. I don't have any talent for interpreting art, so I tend to interpret it wildly, so I don't think I'm interested in it any more."
14293,239,0,20,ESFP,13,"<no>  It's not a big difference, but it seems to follow emotions more. People around me seem to think of me rationally."
14294,239,0,20,ESFP,14,"<Yes>  These days, if a schedule is planned, I feel a lot of anxiety that I won't be able to complete it safely. On days when I don't have a schedule, I feel very relaxed and happy."
14295,239,0,20,ESFP,15,"<no>  tend to be very conscious of how others see me. Ever since I was little, I was very conscious of other people's eyes and tried to look good no matter what I look like to others. Until a few years ago, I cared so much about people's eyes that I couldn't go out without taking a shower."
14296,239,0,20,ESFP,16,"<neutrality>  When it comes to group activities, I really enjoy it. But I don't really want to do it, and I really hate regrets after group activities."
14297,239,0,20,ESFP,17,"<no> Open endings are the ones I hate the most. Even if it's not the ending I want, it suits me better if the writer concludes it."
14298,239,0,20,ESFP,18,"<no>  Of course, I would be very happy if I helped my precious friend succeed and if he succeeds, but because of my personality, my friend should thank me that much and repay me just as much. I won't show it, but I'll be very sad if you don't. Above all else, I think my success comes first."
14299,239,0,20,ESFP,19,"<Yes>  There are many games I want to play, but I remember being disappointed that I could only play one game at a time."
14300,239,0,20,ESFP,20,"<Yes>  I am very worried. It seems to be more of a personality rather than a reason or reason. Ever since I was little, I was worried about even the smallest things. Lately, I have a lot of worries from trivial things to big things, such as whether the door to my room is properly closed, whether I have turned off the gas valve, and whether I have properly locked the car door."
14301,239,0,20,ESFP,21,<no>  I love the leadership role. Having others follow me is a great happiness for me.
14302,239,0,20,ESFP,22,"<Yes>  Their understanding of works of art is low, and their imaginations are abundant, but they find it very difficult to turn them into art."
14303,239,0,20,ESFP,23,"<Yes>  I am not very interested in politics, but I have thought about what it would be like if politicians thought about the national interest more than their own."
14304,239,0,20,ESFP,24,"<Yes>  I think a pleasant environment plays a big role in a better quality of rest. However, he puts off housework."
14305,239,0,20,ESFP,25,<no>  I hate the anxiety that other people will fight. I hope everyone gets along peacefully.
14306,239,0,20,ESFP,26,<no>  It feels good when other people care. I am so happy when people I see for the first time look at me positively.
14307,239,0,20,ESFP,27,"<Yes>  Even on days when you feel very good, little things can make you feel bad. I think it's because I've been sensitive to various things lately."
14308,239,0,20,ESFP,28,<Yes>  It is very irritating to dare to finish something that can be completed more quickly and with less perfection.
14309,239,0,20,ESFP,29,"<Yes>  often put things off until the end. Lately, I haven't had any specific assignments with deadlines, but I used to procrastinate a lot in the past."
14310,239,0,20,ESFP,30,"<Yes>  Every time I die, I wonder what will happen to me. I guess it's because of the fear of death."
14311,239,0,20,ESFP,31,"<Yes>  Time alone is important and precious, but because I feel lonely a lot, I prefer time with friends."
14312,239,0,20,ESFP,32,"<neutrality> Discussions and conversations with like-minded people can be interesting, but discussions with people who have the exact opposite views and think they are unconditionally right are very unpleasant."
14313,239,0,20,ESFP,33,"<neutrality>  I will try very hard to sympathize, but I think it will be difficult to fully sympathize with that person's life. Pretending to know it could hurt you even more."
14314,239,0,20,ESFP,34,"<Yes>  Can't make decisions easily Sometimes it's annoying and I make a rough decision, but most of the time I can't make a decision easily and I'm going to have a good time."
14315,239,0,20,ESFP,35,"<no>  Even if you have already made a decision, you will inevitably worry about it later. I have a lot of worries, so the more important the decision, the more I keep thinking about it."
14316,239,0,20,ESFP,36,"<Yes>  I try to meet up with friends because I prefer to be with friends rather than alone. But these days, I spend a little more time alone."
14317,239,0,20,ESFP,37,"<no> Unless there are world-famous works or famous art museums, I do not prefer to go there."
14318,239,0,20,ESFP,38,"<no>  Ever since I was little, I thought I was good at reading other people's minds. I think I understand other people's feelings better than others."
14319,239,0,20,ESFP,39,"<no>  These days, if I have a planned schedule, I am very anxious. I think it's good to live plannedly, but these days I'm having a little bit of anxiety."
14320,239,0,20,ESFP,40,"<no>  feel very anxious about even the smallest things. If I have anxiety, I can't do anything well and I can't sleep well."
14321,239,0,20,ESFP,41,<no>  likes to call I also like taking calls. It feels good when the phone rings while I am doing other activities.
14322,239,0,20,ESFP,42,"<Yes>  Because I put a lot of effort into understanding others, rather than unconditionally insisting, I try to understand why others thought that way."
14323,239,0,20,ESFP,43,"<neutrality> If there is a friend I want to see, I contact them first, and if there is a friend who is looking for me, they contact me."
14324,239,0,20,ESFP,44,"<neutrality>  I try to go back, but when it's really annoying, I don't think about it and continue the plan as soon as there is a setback."
14325,239,0,20,ESFP,45,<Yes>  I really regret that I made a mistake in the past and wonder why I did it.
14326,239,0,20,ESFP,46,"<no> Sometimes I think deeply. I really wonder how this all came about out of nothing, what the circumstances were before that, and whether all of this is someone's play."
14327,239,0,20,ESFP,47,"<neutrality>  Outside, I try very hard to control my emotions. However, perhaps because he hides his emotions too much outside, he is easily swayed by his emotions in front of his family at home."
14328,239,0,20,ESFP,48,"<no>  No matter how hard I try to look good to others, I am not generous enough to cover up the other person's faults."
14341,240,0,40,ISTJ,1,<no>  I don't make new friends on a regular basis. The reason is that there are not many opportunities to meet new people in the same daily life.
14342,240,0,40,ISTJ,2,<neutrality>  I don't spend any of my free time exploring various interests. The reason tends to dig more into existing interests rather than relatively diverse interests.
14343,240,0,40,ISTJ,3,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I cry when I see other people crying, and sometimes I don't. The reason is that in reality, there are generally many cases where this is not the case, and there are times when empathy is achieved through movies and dramas through media outlets."
14344,240,0,40,ISTJ,4,"<neutrality>  tend not to make preparations in case things go wrong. The reason is that I tend to think a lot about various situations, but there are many times when things don't go the way I thought."
14345,240,0,40,ISTJ,5,"<no>  I'm not good at keeping my composure under pressure. The reason is that they are sensitive, so they do not maintain their composure well under pressure or various unexpected situations."
14346,240,0,40,ISTJ,6,"<Yes>  prefer to talk to people I already know rather than new people. The reason is that I have a lot of shyness and worry about the inconvenience of meeting new people, and I prefer to talk with people I already know rather than new people."
14347,240,0,40,ISTJ,7,"<no>  I don't like to start another project after completing one. The reason is that there is an impromptu part, so when something new interests me, I often dig in that direction."
14348,240,0,40,ISTJ,8,<Yes>  am very sentimental. The reason is that I am emotionally very sensitive and influenced by my emotions.
14349,240,0,40,ISTJ,9,"<neutrality>  I like to make plans, such as schedules and lists. The reason is that I enjoy making plans rather than executing them. However, this is only limited to areas I like or are interested in."
14350,240,0,40,ISTJ,10,"<Yes>  often doubt my ability or knowledge because of small mistakes. The reason is that I lack confidence in my knowledge or abilities. When I went to the site for the first time in a performance work, I had doubts because it had been a while since my experience was correct."
14351,240,0,40,ISTJ,11,"<no>  I can't easily approach people. The reason is that I worry about what the other person is thinking and I have a lot of thoughts, so I can't approach it easily."
14352,240,0,40,ISTJ,12,"<no>  I love to debate because of the different interpretations of a work of art. The reason is that having a discussion itself is where various opinions come and go, so I think it is very interesting to hear each person's thoughts on what is shown in the work."
14353,240,0,40,ISTJ,13,"<neutrality> For me, emotions and reason follow each other differently depending on the situation. The reason is that emotions are strong when it comes to things related to acquaintances, and rationality is strong when it comes to strangers or parts of things."
14354,240,0,40,ISTJ,14,"<neutrality>  Sometimes I improvise my schedule for the day and sometimes I don't. The reason is that I usually plan a schedule for the day, but unlike the plan, I lack the ability to execute it, and also, if a new thing I am interested in happens, I tend to resolve it first."
14355,240,0,40,ISTJ,15,<Yes>  I tend to care a lot about other people's eyes. The reason is that I care a lot about the way others look at me or why. I think they are similar because I tend to think that way when I look at others.
14356,240,0,40,ISTJ,16,"<no>  do not enjoy participating in group activities. The reason is that they don't like hanging out with new people, and even if they do, they prefer small groups."
14357,240,0,40,ISTJ,17,"<no>  I'm not much of a fan of books and movies with free interpretations of the ending. The reason is that I prefer things that have been decided rather than letting my imagination run wild, and I prefer to appreciate the artistic feeling of the artist who intended them. I love the Netflix drama The Last Kingdom."
14358,240,0,40,ISTJ,18,"<neutrality>  I find pleasure or satisfaction in helping others succeed rather than in my own work. The reason is that in the case of my interests or acquaintances, there are cases where I feel interest and satisfaction even if it is not my job. But if it's not your field of interest or it's not the case of an acquaintance, you won't even be interested."
14359,240,0,40,ISTJ,19,"<no>  I have so many interests that I rarely know what to do next. The reason is that you don't have too many interests at once, and you have clear goals for the things you care about."
14360,240,0,40,ISTJ,20,"<Yes>  am often worried that things will go wrong. The reason is that I like a set situation rather than an unexpected situation, and I often imagine various situations that did not happen because I was afraid that an unexpected situation would happen."
14361,240,0,40,ISTJ,21,"<Yes>  I do not prefer to play a leadership role. The reason is because of his personal inclination, he hates taking responsibility for someone and does not prefer to stand in front of others."
14362,240,0,40,ISTJ,22,"<no>  think I have a lot of artistic inclinations. The reason is that since I was young, I have been doing music and performance work, and I think I have enough artistic senses and inclinations."
14363,240,0,40,ISTJ,23,"<no>  I don't think that a society that valued reason would have made the world a better place. I think there is no answer to emotions and reasons for everything. When looking at the results, there are only things that are prioritized, but I think that what each person needs will be different depending on the situation as each person thinks differently."
14364,240,0,40,ISTJ,24,"<no>  I don't want to finish my chores before going to bed. The reason is that I try to avoid doing housework as much as possible, but I don't think I have to do housework until I put off taking a break."
14365,240,0,40,ISTJ,25,"<neutrality> There are times when I like watching other people's arguments and there are times when I don't like it. The reason is that the debate in the part I'm interested in is interesting and fun, but in the part I'm not, it's just stressful."
14366,240,0,40,ISTJ,26,"<Yes>  I tend to avoid attracting other people's attention. The reason is that I don't like getting attention from people, so I'm on the side of the burden of paying attention to me."
14367,240,0,40,ISTJ,27,"<Yes>  am very sensitive to emotional changes. The reason is that I have been involved in art activities since I was young, and I am very sensitive to sounds and emotional parts."
14368,240,0,40,ISTJ,28,"<Yes>  I tend to get annoyed with people who aren't efficient. The reason is that I get annoyed when I work stuffy in my own way, even though there are efficient methods."
14369,240,0,40,ISTJ,29,"<neutrality> Sometimes I put things off until the end. The reason is that I know what I need to do, but I tend to procrastinate when things don't go my way or when things don't go my way."
14370,240,0,40,ISTJ,30,"<no>  I am not interested in the afterlife question. The reason is that there is no belief in the afterlife, and I think that death is the end."
14371,240,0,40,ISTJ,31,"<neutrality>  like my alone time. The reason is that I care a lot about other people, so I tend to get a lot of stress about it. However, in the case of close acquaintances, they prefer to spend time together because they have this less stressful part."
14372,240,0,40,ISTJ,32,"<no>  I don't think I'm bored with theory-oriented discussions and principled stories. The reason is that the content of the direct problem is more important than the problem of the method or attitude, so I think the boredom of the content according to the method is separate."
14373,240,0,40,ISTJ,33,"<no>  I don't easily empathize with people from a different background than mine. The reason is that there are many people from different backgrounds who have different thinking tendencies or ways of thinking, so it is not easy to empathize with them."
14374,240,0,40,ISTJ,34,<Yes>  I tend to postpone decisions until the end. The reason is that I prefer to make this decision with certainty rather than the idea of postponing it unless I am certain.
14375,240,0,40,ISTJ,35,"<no>  I am rethinking the decisions I have already made. The reason is that even after making a decision, if it was a wrong decision or if I have other thoughts, I tend to think again even in situations where I can't help it."
14376,240,0,40,ISTJ,36,"<no> I'm not the type to unwind a week with a fun party or event. The reason is that such an event or party is like a job, not to relieve fatigue. I need only my own time to relax."
14377,240,0,40,ISTJ,37,"<neutrality>  I don't like going to art galleries. The reason is that I don't have much interest in art works. But I like to listen to music, etc."
14378,240,0,40,ISTJ,38,"<Yes>  often find it difficult to understand other people's feelings. I think the reason is because each person's environment and thoughts are different. I have never raised a dog or cat, so it is difficult to sympathize more seriously than empathy to the extent of being sad."
14379,240,0,40,ISTJ,39,<no>  I don't plan what to do every day. The reason is that I think it is unnecessary to re-plan every day because I think in a bigger way than every day.
14380,240,0,40,ISTJ,40,"<no>  feel a lot of insecurity. The reason is that everything needs to be clear, but I feel insecure when it is not confirmed because I am a person who puts my mind at ease."
14381,240,0,40,ISTJ,41,"<Yes>  I would like to avoid making phone calls as much as possible. The reason is that I prefer texting rather than calling whenever possible. It may be different in terms of work, but there are many things that are inconvenient on the phone because you have to talk while being considerate of the other person."
14382,240,0,40,ISTJ,42,"<neutrality>  I don't spend much time trying to understand opinions that differ from mine. If the reason is different from mine, I put a lot of thought and effort into understanding it, but if I think the reason is absurd, I think it's a waste of even one second."
14383,240,0,40,ISTJ,43,<Yes>  I tend to contact my friends first. The reason is that I don't really feel the difference between doing it first and doing it late.
14384,240,0,40,ISTJ,44,"<Yes>  I make an effort to go back if my plans are disrupted. The reason is that I am very stressed about the changing circumstances of the plan. Recently, students who were teaching lectures suddenly applied for more than twice as much, and the existing lecture plan was twisted. So, we are discussing with the school to divide existing students and new students."
14385,240,0,40,ISTJ,45,"<Yes>  I often regret my past mistakes. The reason is that there are many times when I have lived in idleness, so there are many times when I regret that I was insincere or lazy in the past."
14386,240,0,40,ISTJ,46,"<no>  don't think deeply about human existence and why we live. The reason is that I don't think it's necessary to think about an answer that has already been decided. It is because human existence is already determined at birth, and there is a reason for living, not living because there is a reason for living."
14387,240,0,40,ISTJ,47,"<no>  I'm not the type to be swayed by emotions. Reason is to hide your emotions and try not to express them outwardly. You may be swayed on the inside, but you may not appear so on the outside."
14388,240,0,40,ISTJ,48,"<no>  I don't try to save the other person's face when it's their fault. The reason is that it doesn't make sense to have to be considerate of wrong behavior for various reasons, whether it's face or emotion. I think it's just a matter of the way the error is conveyed."
